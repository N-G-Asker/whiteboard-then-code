  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a greedy algorithm to find the longest strictly increasing sequence that is possible to obtain from the given sequence by taking either the leftmost element or the rightmost element. This approach involves iterating through the sequence and maintaining a set of elements that are already in the sequence. At each step, you can either add the leftmost element to the set or the rightmost element to the set, depending on which element is not already in the set. This approach is more efficient than using dynamic programming, especially for larger sequences.

  Your approach is good, but there are a few minor issues that can be improved. First, you should consider the case where the white sheet is not fully covered by the black sheets. In this case, there may be a point that lies strictly outside of both black sheets and strictly inside the white sheet. You can check this by finding the intersection of the two black sheets and the white sheet. If the intersection is not empty, then there is at least one point that can be seen from the above.

Instead of looking at each friend individually, you can use a more efficient algorithm to find the values of $f_i$ for all friends at once. This can be done by using a technique called "dynamic programming" or "memoization." This technique involves storing the values of $f_i$ for each friend in a table, and then using the table to find the values of $f_i$ for each friend more efficiently. This can help reduce the time and space complexity

  I suggest adding a step to the updated approach to handle the case where the maximum and minimum values are equal. In this case, the instability of the array is 0, but the minimum possible instability is 1. To handle this case, you can add a check to see if the maximum and minimum values are equal, and if so, return 1 as the minimum possible instability. This will ensure that the minimum possible instability is always returned, even in the case where the maximum and minimum values are equal.

  Your approach is correct, but you can simplify the calculation by noticing that the number of tuples (A, B, C) that satisfy A \times B + C = N can be calculated as the sum of the number of tuples (A, B) that satisfy A \times B = N and the number of tuples (A, C) that satisfy A + C = N. This is because any tuple (A, B, C) that satisfies A \times B + C = N can be obtained by combining a tuple (A, B) that satisfies A \times B = N with a tuple (

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient data structure than a stack to keep track of the opening and closing brackets. For example, you could use a hash table to map each opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket, and vice versa. This would allow you to check if a bracket is balanced in O(1) time, rather than O(n) time using a stack. Additionally, you could use a more efficient algorithm to check if a bracket sequence is regular, such as the "scan" algorithm described in the problem statement.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a sliding window technique to find the maximum possible length of the substring we can remove. This approach involves maintaining two pointers, one pointing to the start of the substring and the other pointing to the end of the substring. As we move the end pointer, we check if the substring is a subsequence of $s$. If it is, we update the maximum length of the substring. If it's not, we move the start pointer until we find a subsequence that is a valid substring. This approach ensures that we only consider substrings that are valid and helps us

  Your approach is correct, but there is a small improvement that can be made. Instead of finding the maximum possible value of x and y separately and then multiplying them, you can find the maximum possible value of x \* y directly by finding the maximum product of x and y that satisfies the constraints. This can be done by finding the maximum product of x and y that is less than or equal to the maximum of b and d. This will give you the correct answer in one step, rather than two steps.

Specifically, you can use a two-dimensional array dp to store the maximum number of problems in a valid contest of size i and difficulty j, where i is the number of problems in the contest and j is the difficulty of the hardest problem in the contest.

Additionally, you can use a similar approach to find the least common multiple of all pairs of numbers in the array that have indices $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \le i < j \le n$.

This can be done by creating a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to climb up to the i-th step from the j-th step. The base case is dp[0][0] = 1, as there is only one way to climb up to the 0-

This will help you to avoid considering the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination for some values that are not possible.

For example, if the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination is 1, then the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination is the smallest possible if the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination is 1 modulo

Instead of using a loop to count the number of digits in the number n, you can use the built-in function "log10" to calculate the number of digits. The "log10" function returns the base 10 logarithm of a number, so it can be used to calculate the number of digits in a number.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the possibility of multiple Z values that satisfy the three conditions. Instead of just considering the first Z value that satisfies all three conditions, you can consider all possible Z values and check if any of them satisfy all three conditions. This will help you find the optimal Z value that satisfies all three conditions, which will lead to a more accurate solution. Additionally, you can use a loop to iterate through all possible Z values and check if they satisfy all three conditions.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of T_1, T_2,..., T_N as the time when the hands of all clocks point directly upward again. This is because the LCM is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all the input values, which means that it is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all the time intervals T_i.

This approach will help you avoid overcounting the number of problems needed to form teams.

You can start by sorting the students by their skills in descending order. Then, you can solve problems for the first student until they have formed 1 team. After that, you can solve problems for the next 2 students until they have formed 2 teams. This approach will ensure that you solve the minimum number of problems

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the problem from a different perspective. Instead of focusing on the longest sequence of consecutive zeros, you could try to find the longest sequence of consecutive ones. This approach would require you to keep track of the number of consecutive ones you have encountered, and to update this number as you move through the schedule. This approach would also require you to consider the possibility of a sequence of consecutive zeros, which could be a challenge. However, it could also provide a different perspective on the problem, which could help you to find a solution that you might not have considered otherwise.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the case where X is a multiple of A. In this case, the largest integer that Takahashi can buy is X/A, which is an integer. This is because the price of each integer is A \times N + B \times d(N), where N is the integer, and d(N) is the number of digits in the decimal notation of N. Since X is a multiple of A, the price of each integer is a multiple of A, and the largest integer that Takahashi can buy is X/A.

  Your approach is a good start, but it can be improved by using a sliding window technique to find the substring of S that matches T. This approach involves maintaining a window of size equal to the length of T and sliding it through the string S, checking for a match at each position. This approach can be more efficient than your current approach, especially for longer strings.

==============================
  Your approach is good, but there are a few things you can do to improve it. First, you can use a more efficient algorithm to find the K-th largest prime number that divides both A and B. One such algorithm is the Sieve of Sundaram, which has a time complexity of O(n log log n) instead of O(n log n).

Second, you can use a more efficient data structure to store the prime numbers that divide both A and B. Instead of using a list, you can use a hash table to store the prime numbers and their frequencies. This will reduce the time complexity

==============================
  Your approach is correct, but you can simplify the calculation by noticing that the number of 500-yen coins and 5-yen coins are equal, since they are both 1000-yen coins. Therefore, the total number of happiness points is 200 \* 1000 = 20,000.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the following:

* Instead of considering each person separately, consider the total stamina spent by all N people attending the meeting.
* This can be done by calculating the sum of the squared differences between the coordinates of all N people and the meeting coordinate P.
* This will give you the minimum total stamina that all N people have to spend to attend the meeting.
* You can then print the result as the answer.
* This approach will help you avoid considering each person separately and will give you the correct answer.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the case where A = 1 and B = 1. In this case, the minimum number of power strips required is 0, as there is no need to extend the socket with a power strip. This case can be handled separately, and it is important to consider it to ensure that the solution is correct for all possible inputs.

Another suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the case where A = 20 and B = 20. In this case, the minimum number of power strips required is 1, as one power strip

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a dictionary to map the forecast characters to their corresponding weather conditions.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient data structure to store the indices of the elements that satisfy the condition. Instead of using a dictionary, you can use a set to store the indices. This will reduce the time complexity of your code from O(n) to O(1), which will make your code more efficient. Additionally, you can use a more efficient algorithm to find the second smallest number among p_i - 1, p_i, and p_i + 1. You can use the following code to find the second smallest number:

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to find the center of the circle. Instead of finding the average of all the x-coordinates and y-coordinates, you can use the method of "least squares" to find the center of the circle. This method involves finding the point that minimizes the sum of the squared distances between the point and the center of the circle. This method is more efficient than finding the average of all the points, especially for large datasets.

  I suggest that you consider using a hash table or a dictionary to keep track of the elements of $t$ and their corresponding counts in $s$. This will allow you to quickly find the maximum number of times each element of $t$ appears in $s$ without considering duplicates. Additionally, you can use a stack or a queue to keep track of the elements of $t$ in the order in which they appear in $s$. This will allow you to easily find the maximum number of copies of $t$ that can be cut out from $s$.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. Instead of trying all possible orders of rows, you can use a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum $k$ such that there exists some order of rows of matrix $a$ that it produces a $k$-acceptable traversal. This approach involves breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems and solving them recursively. By using this approach, you can reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from $O(n!)$ to $O(n^2)$ or even $O(n^3)$, which can be

==============================
  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to find the minimum number of characters to remove from the file name. Instead of using a loop to iterate through the file name, you can use a more efficient algorithm such as the KMP algorithm to find the first occurrence of the substring "xxx" in the file name. This will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from O(n) to O(n/3), where n is the length of the file name.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use the formula for the area of a regular dodecagon inscribed in a circle to find the area of the dodecagon inscribed in the circle of radius r. This formula is A(r) = 3r^2. This formula can be used directly to find the area of the dodecagon inscribed in the circle of radius r, without having to use the formula for the area of a regular dodecagon. This can simplify the solution and make it more efficient.

  Your approach is clear and concise, and you have provided a working solution. However, I would suggest adding a brief explanation of the problem and its constraints at the beginning of the code, as well as some comments to explain the logic behind your solution. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand for others who may be working on the problem. Additionally, you could consider using a more descriptive variable name than "sheep_count" and "wolf_count" to make the code more readable.
==============================

==============================
  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use the fact that the area of a right triangle is half the product of the lengths of the sides to find the area of the triangle. This can be done by multiplying both sides of the formula by 2 and then simplifying the expression. This approach is more straightforward and efficient than using the fact that the sum of the lengths of the sides is equal to the length of the hypotenuse.
==============================

==============================
  Your approach is good, but you can simplify it by focusing on the second constraint. Instead of considering all possible combinations of money and sound, you can start by considering the maximum number of times Takahashi can hear the sound with his initial amount of money.

  I think it would be helpful to add some error handling to the code to ensure that the user inputs valid values for A and B. For example, we could check if the input values are integers using the `isinstance()` function, and if not, print an error message and exit the program. This would help prevent the program from crashing if the user enters invalid input.

==============================
  Your approach is correct, but you could simplify the explanation by stating that the machine produces B biscuits at each multiple of A seconds after activation. This is because the machine produces B biscuits at A seconds, 2A seconds, 3A seconds, and each subsequent multiple of A seconds.

  The variables and their values are:

* K: the multiple of which the carry distance must be a multiple
* A: the lower bound of the carry distance
* B: the upper bound of the carry distance

==============================
  Your approach is correct, but you can simplify the calculation by noticing that the time ratio between World B and World A is X:1, so the time it takes Taro to study for T hours in World B is equal to T hours in World A.

==============================
  Your approach is correct, but you can simplify the calculation by noticing that the amount of water that will remain in Bottle 2 is simply C - B, since you have already transferred 2 milliliters of water from Bottle 2 to Bottle 1. This saves you from having to calculate the amount of water that will remain in Bottle 2 explicitly.

  Your approach is correct, but there is a small mistake in the explanation. Instead of saying "Let P and Q be the a-th and b-th lexicographically smallest permutations, respectively," you should say "Let P and Q be the a-th and b-th permutations in lexicographical order, respectively." This will make the explanation more clear and concise. Additionally, you can simplify the explanation by noting that the lexicographical order is a total order, so the difference between the positions of P and Q in the lexicographical order is the same as the difference between their positions in

==============================
  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a hash table to store the ACGT strings that are substrings of S, rather than using a trie data structure. This can help to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm even further, as hash tables have a constant time complexity for lookups. Additionally, you can use a hash function to map each ACGT string to a unique integer, which can help to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm even further.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider using a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. This approach involves breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems and storing the solutions to these sub-problems to avoid redundant computation.

This can make a significant difference in the time it takes to solve the problem for larger values of N.

Additionally, you can consider using a more descriptive variable name than "S" and "T" to make the code more readable.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient data structure to store the coordinates of the black stones. Instead of using a list of all 2000001 coordinates, you could use a hash table or a binary search tree to store only the coordinates of the black stones. This would reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from O(n) to O(log n) or O(1), where n is the number of black stones.

First, you can simplify the calculation of d by using the fact that the distance between two points is equal to the length of the vector that connects them. Specifically, you can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance between the i-th point and the j-th point as follows:

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a bit vector to store the security code. Instead of using a for loop to iterate through the digits of the security code, you can use a bit vector to store the security code. This will make the code more efficient and easier to read. Additionally, you can use the bit vector to check if the security code is hard to enter. If the bit vector contains two consecutive bits that are the same, you can print Bad. If the bit vector does not contain two consecutive bits that are the same, you can print Good.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use the "find" function to find all occurrences of the substring "ABC" in the string "S" at once, and then use the "substring" function to extract the substrings from the positions of the first occurrence to the positions of the next occurrence. This approach reduces the time complexity of the algorithm from O(N) to O(1) by avoiding the need to iterate through the string multiple times. Additionally, this approach can be further optimized by using a more efficient algorithm to find the occurrences of the substring "ABC" in the string "S".

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the third condition first. Instead of choosing three people and then checking if the names of the chosen people meet the second condition, you can start by choosing three letters (M, A, R, C, or H) and then choosing three people whose names start with those letters. This approach can reduce the number of combinations and make the problem easier to solve.

  Your approach is correct, but you can simplify the explanation by saying that Takahashi's submission gets an AC if and only if M is equal to N.

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few things you can do to improve it. First, instead of sorting the routes by their costs, you can sort them by their times. This will make the algorithm faster, because you can stop checking routes as soon as you find one that takes not longer than time T. Second, you can use a binary search to find the smallest cost of a route that takes not longer than time T. This will make the algorithm even faster, because you can narrow down the search space quickly. Finally, you can use a data structure like a heap to store the routes and their costs,

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a hash table to store the characters of each string, rather than a trie or suffix tree. This will allow you to quickly check if a string is an anagram of another string, which can be useful in reducing the number of comparisons you need to make. Additionally, you can use a hash table to keep track of the number of times each character appears in each string, which can help you determine if a string is an anagram of another string.

This will help you identify the optimal strategy for carrying umbrellas and avoiding getting wet. Additionally, you can consider the time it takes to move from one point to another, which will help you determine the best time to pick up and throw away umbrellas. By considering these factors, you can develop a more comprehensive approach to solving the problem.

  Your approach is good, but there is a small mistake in the logical expression. Instead of using (A!= C), you should use (A!= B). This is because if A and C are equal, then A and B are also equal, so we only need to check if A is equal to B.

Additionally, you can simplify the expression by using the logical OR operator (||) instead of the logical AND operator (&&). The expression can be simplified to (A == B) || (A!= B).

  Your approach is correct, but you can simplify the solution by noticing that the monster's health will always decrease by A after each attack. Therefore, you can calculate the number of attacks needed to make the monster's health become 0 or below as follows:

H / A

This is because the monster's health will decrease by A after each attack, so the number of attacks needed to make the monster's health become 0 or below is equal to the number of times the monster's health can be decreased by A.

  Your approach is correct, but you can simplify the solution by noticing that the time difference between the start-up of the robot and the time when Alice started holding down her button A is equal to the time difference between the start-up of the robot and the time when Bob started holding down his button C. This means that you can calculate the time when both Alice and Bob were holding down their buttons by subtracting the time difference between the start-up of the robot and the time when Alice started holding down her button A from the time difference between the start-up of the robot and the time when Bob started holding down his

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient formula to calculate the number of odd numbers with exactly eight divisors. Instead of using the formula (n-1)/2 + 1, you can use the formula (n-1)/2 + 1 - (n-1)/4, which is more efficient and avoids double-counting. This formula is based on the fact that the number of divisors of an odd number is always one more than half the number of divisors of its square.

==============================
  Your approach is good, but there is a small mistake in the calculation of the difference. Instead of using |x - y| + |x - z| + |y - z| + |x - y - z|, you should use |x - y| + |x - z| + |y - z| + |x - y - z|. This is because the difference between the largest and smallest number of crackers received by a user can be negative, and the absolute value of a negative number is the same as the original number.

To further improve your approach, you can consider using a

  Your approach is correct, but you can simplify the explanation by noting that Kurohashi can make his debut in ABC N because all the digits of N are the same. This is because Kurohashi wants to make his debut in some ABC x such that all the digits of x in base ten are the same, and since N has all the same digits, it meets this condition.

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few things you can do to improve it. First, you can simplify the equation for finding the minimum cost for each pair of tasks by noticing that the cost is always non-negative, so you can drop the absolute value sign. This will make the equation easier to solve.

Second, you can use a more efficient algorithm to find the minimum cost for each pair of tasks. One way to do this is to use a dynamic programming approach, where you keep track of the minimum cost for each pair of tasks as you go through the tasks. This will allow you to

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to find the minimum m that satisfies the condition. Instead of using a binary search algorithm, you can use a linear search algorithm to find the minimum m.

==============================
  Your approach is good, but you can simplify the calculation of Y by noticing that the maximum possible value of Y is equal to the maximum possible value of ∑C_i. This is because the sum of the costs is the maximum possible value of Y, and the sum of the costs is equal to the maximum possible value of ∑C_i. Therefore, you can calculate Y directly as ∑C_i, without having to calculate the sum of the costs first. This will save you some time and computational resources.

This will make your code more efficient and easier to read. Finally, you can use the `print()` function to print the result instead of using the `print` statement. This will make your code more concise and easier to read

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient data structure than a dictionary to store the characters in the string. A dictionary is a good choice for this problem because it allows you to easily check if a character is in the string or not. However, if the string is very large, using a dictionary may not be the most efficient way to store the characters. Instead, you could use a more efficient data structure such as a hash table or a bit vector to store the characters. This would allow you to check if a character is in the string more quickly and efficiently.

  Your approach is correct, but you can simplify the solution by noticing that A + B = A - (-B) = A + (-B) = A - B, and A \* B = -A \* (-B) = -A \* B = -A + B. This means that the largest number among A + B, A - B, and A \* B is A + B. You can also use a single variable to store the largest number and update it as you go through the cases. This will help you avoid repeating the same calculations multiple times.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a loop to iterate through the mountains, starting from the second mountain (i = 2) and ending at the last mountain (i = N). This will allow you to avoid repeating the same calculations for each mountain. Additionally, you can use a variable to keep track of the number of inns from which you can see the ocean, and update it accordingly for each mountain. This will help you avoid having to manually count the number of inns that meet the criteria.

  One suggestion to improve your approach is to use a hash table to store the number of steps in each stairway. This will allow you to quickly look up the number of steps in a stairway by its index, rather than having to iterate through the sorted list of numbers.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to find the solution. Instead of trying all possible values of $x$ and $k$, you can use a more systematic approach to find the solution.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a greedy algorithm that starts with the tallest person and adds the next person in the list as long as the difference in heights between the two people is less than or equal to 1. This approach will ensure that the circle is balanced and will also help to reduce the number of people that need to be added to the circle. Additionally, you can use a priority queue to keep track of the people that need to be added to the circle and their heights. This will help to ensure that the tallest person is added first and that the circle is balanced.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient data structure to store the characters and their frequencies, such as a hash table or a trie. This will allow you to quickly look up the frequency of each character in the substring, which is important for ensuring that each substring has exactly $b$ distinct letters. Additionally, you can use a more efficient rolling hash function, such as the FNV-1a hash function, which is faster and more efficient than the naive rolling hash function.

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few things you can do to improve it. First, you can simplify the problem by noticing that the number of groups of three or more students is equal to the number of groups of three students plus the number of groups of two students. This is because each group of three students can be paired with a group of two students, and each group of two students can be paired with a group of one student. This means that you only need to consider the number of groups of three students and the number of groups of two students, rather than the number of groups of three

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use the `math.divmod()` function instead of the `divmod()` function. The `math.divmod()` function is a built-in function in Python that performs the same operation as the `divmod()` function but is more efficient and easier to use. Additionally, you can use the `math.gcd()` function to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, which can be useful in this problem.

To improve your approach, you can consider the following:

Additionally, you can consider using a more descriptive variable name than X and Y, as they are not very informative.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a sliding window technique to find the prefix of S that is also a suffix of S. This can be done by maintaining a window of size N that slides through the string S, and checking if the substring of S within the window is a suffix of the substring of S outside the window. This approach can reduce the time complexity of the algorithm from O(N^2) to O(N).

This formula is more efficient because it avoids the need to perform the modulo operation, which can be computationally expensive. Additionally, this formula is more intuitive and easier to understand, which can make your code more readable and maintainable.

==============================
  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use the formula for the number of digits in a base K representation directly, rather than converting the number of digits in the binary representation of N to the base K representation. This can be done by using the formula:

logK(N) + 1

This formula directly gives the number of digits in the base K representation of N, without the need to convert the number of digits in the binary representation of N to the base K representation. This can simplify the solution and make it more efficient.

  Your approach is good, but there is a small mistake in the third point. If A = 1 and B = 10, then they can take 1 piece of cake each.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the problem:

The problem is asking whether both E869120 and square1001 can take the desired number of pieces of cake while obeying the instruction in the note. The note states that the same person should not take two adjacent pieces of cake.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to find the shortest path between any pair of vertices. Instead of using Dijkstra's algorithm, you can use Floyd's algorithm, which is more efficient for finding the shortest path in a graph. Floyd's algorithm is an extension of Bellman-Ford algorithm that can handle negative weight edges. It is more efficient than Dijkstra's algorithm because it only updates the distance and parent of the vertex if the new distance is shorter than the previous one. This can help reduce the time complexity of your algorithm.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient data structure to store the longest subsequence and its indices. Instead of using a 1D array and a hash table, you could use a 2D array to store the longest subsequence and its indices for each subarray.

  Your approach is correct, but it can be simplified by noting that the i-th car from the front of the train is the (N - i + 1)-th car from the back.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the relationship between $a$ and $b$ and think about how you can use this relationship to reduce the number of moves required to obtain $b$ from $a$. For example, if $a$ and $b$ have a large difference, you may be able to use a series of moves that subtracts or adds a large number to $a$ to reduce the difference between $a$ and $b$. This can help reduce the number of moves required to obtain $b$ from $a$.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to find the maximum integer $k$ such that $0 \le k \le n$ and $k \bmod x = y$. One such algorithm is the binary search algorithm. The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and checking the middle value. If the middle value is greater than the maximum value, we know that the maximum value must be in the lower half of the search interval. If the middle value is less than the maximum value, we know that the maximum value must be in the upper half of the search interval

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use the `charAt()` method instead of the `for` loop to iterate through the characters of the string. This is because the `charAt()` method returns the character at the specified index, which is more efficient than iterating through the characters using a `for` loop. Additionally, you can use the `toLowerCase()` method to convert the character to lowercase without having to use a separate `if` statement to check if the character is uppercase. This can simplify your code and make it more readable.

This algorithm works by first finding the longest common substring between two strings and then swapping the characters in the two strings that are not in the longest common substring. This algorithm is more efficient than swapping characters one by one because it reduces the number of comparisons needed to rearrange the characters.

Additionally, you can consider the maximum number of candies that can be collected in the top-left and bottom-right squares, which can help you determine the overall maximum number of candies that can be collected. By considering these factors, you can determine the best way to travel and maximize the number of candies collected.

==============================
  Your approach is good, but there is a small mistake in the calculation of the number of candies in the third box. In the second step, the number of candies in the third box should be 1, not 2. This mistake does not affect the final answer, but it is important to correct it to ensure that the calculation is accurate. Additionally, you can consider using a more efficient data structure to store the number of candies in each box, such as an array or a hash table, to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few things you can do to improve it. First, you can consider the fact that the sum of the numbers in each row should be equal to the sum of the numbers in each column. This means that you can eliminate some of the possible sets of integers.

==============================
  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by x. This can be more efficient than dividing and rounding up to the nearest integer. For example, if you want to find the number of integers between 4 and 8, inclusive, that are divisible by 2, you can use the following code:

(b - a + 1) % x

This will give you the same result as your approach, but it is more efficient and easier to read.

  Your approach is good, but you can simplify it by using a single case statement for all the cases. This will make the code more concise and easier to read. Additionally, you can use a default case to handle any unexpected values of D.

switch(D) {
    case 22:
    case 23:
    case 24:
    case 25:

        break;
}

==============================
  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to solve the problem. Instead of checking each integer between 1 and N (inclusive) to see if it can be divided by 2 without remainder, you can use a mathematical formula to determine the number of times an integer can be divisible by 2. For example, you can use the formula (N - 1) / 2 to determine the number of times an integer between 1 and N (inclusive) can be divisible by 2. This formula works because the number of times an integer can be divisible by

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the distance between A and C as the sum of the distances between A and B and between B and C. This will help you to simplify the problem and make it easier to determine if A and C can communicate, either directly or indirectly. Additionally, you can use a graph to represent the situation, where A, B, and C are vertices, and the distance between them is the weight of the edge between them. This will help you to visualize the situation and make it easier to determine if A and C can communicate.

  Your approach is good, but you can simplify the cases by considering only the two coins that Takahashi has. If Takahashi has A-yen and B-yen coins, he can buy the toy. If he has only A-yen or only B-yen coins, he cannot buy the toy. If he has neither A-yen nor B-yen coins, he cannot buy the toy. This approach eliminates the need to consider the fourth case. Additionally, you can use a single if-else statement to check if Takahashi can buy the toy, which will make

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient data structure to store the results of the previous calculations. Instead of using a 2D array, you can use a 1D array with a size of N, where each element represents the number of ways to select the cards with a sum of A. This approach will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from O(N^2) to O(N). Additionally, you can use a hash table to store the results of the previous calculations, which will further reduce the time complexity to O(1).

==============================
  Your approach is correct, but it can be improved by using a more efficient algorithm. Instead of performing the second operation twice, you can perform it only once and then store the result in a variable. This will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from O(n^2) to O(n). Additionally, you can use a more efficient data structure to store the sequence b, such as a linked list or an array, which will also reduce the time complexity of your algorithm.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the relationship between the moves and the monster's health. Instead of considering each move individually, think about how the moves can be combined to achieve the desired outcome. For example, you can use the first move to make the monster's health become 6, then use the second move to make the monster's health become 1, and finally use the third move to make the monster's health become 0 or below. This approach can help you find a solution more efficiently.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to find the longest even string. Instead of removing characters from the end of the string and checking if the resulting string is even, you can use a sliding window approach to find the longest even substring. This approach involves maintaining two pointers, one pointing to the start of the substring and the other pointing to the end of the substring. You can then move the end pointer until you find a non-even substring, and then move the start pointer until you find a non-even substring. This approach will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from O(n

==============================
  Your approach is correct, but it can be improved by using a more efficient algorithm. Instead of checking if S is equal to abc, you can use a hash table to check if S contains all the characters of abc in the same order.

Additionally, you can use a more efficient data structure such as a set to store the characters of abc instead of a string.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm for calculating the remainder. Instead of using the naive approach of calculating the remainder of each intermediate result, you can use a more efficient method such as the Euclidean algorithm or the binary search algorithm to calculate the remainder.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a data structure that allows you to efficiently check if a conversation is already on the screen, add or remove a conversation from the screen, and change the order of the conversations on the screen. A hash table or a priority queue can be used to keep track of the conversations and their corresponding friend. Additionally, you can use a queue to keep track of the order in which the conversations are displayed on the screen. This will help you to avoid having to iterate through the entire list of conversations each time you receive a new message, which can be time-consuming.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the blocks of the given field. You can change the elements in the blocks to make them unique and different from the given field. This will help you to reduce the number of possible choices for each element in the first row, second row, third row, first column, second column, and third column. By considering the blocks, you can reduce the number of possible choices for each element and make it easier to find a solution.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the position of each element in each permutation $p_i(n)$. Instead of calculating the position of each element in each permutation $p_i(n)$ one by one, you can use a hash table to store the positions of each element in each permutation $p_i(n)$. This will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a data structure called a "disjoint set" or "union-find" data structure to keep track of the vertices that have already been visited during the search. This data structure can help you avoid revisiting the same vertices multiple times, which can save time and reduce the number of comparisons you need to make.

To use a disjoint set data structure, you can create a set of vertices that have not been visited yet, and then iterate through the vertices in the query. For each vertex, you can check if it has already been visited or not. If it

  I think it would be helpful to consider the problem from a different perspective. Instead of focusing on building roads, we can think about the problem as a graph problem. We can represent each district as a node in a graph, and each road as an edge between two nodes. We can then use graph theory to find a minimum spanning tree of the graph, which will connect all the districts and satisfy the conditions. This approach will allow us to solve the problem more efficiently and with a more straightforward solution.

This will reduce the memory usage and improve the performance of your algorithm. Additionally, you can use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the maximum weight of an edge on a simple path between $u$ and $v$ that doesn't contain any edge with weight greater than $w$. One such algorithm is the Floyd-Warshall

  Your approach is a good start, but there is one potential issue with the greedy algorithm. If there are multiple cookies of the same size, and multiple children have the same greed factor, you may end up assigning the same cookie to multiple children, which could lead to some children not being content. To improve your approach, you could consider using a different sorting algorithm, such as a stable sort, to ensure that the children with the highest greed factors are assigned the largest cookies first. This would help ensure that all children are content, even in the case where there are multiple cookies of the same size.

This will make your code more readable and easier to understand. Additionally, you can use a more descriptive variable name for the input string, such as "s" or "input_string". This will make your code more readable and easier to understand.

==============================
  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a single priority queue to find both the K smallest and K largest integers between A and B. This will simplify the code and reduce the number of variables needed to keep track of the current smallest and largest integers. Additionally, you can use a single set to store all the integers that are either in the K smallest or K largest integers, which will also simplify the code and reduce the number of variables needed.
==============================

==============================
  Your approach is good, but you can improve it by considering the length of the string. Since the length of the string is between 1 and 100, inclusive, you can use a loop to iterate through the characters of the string and check if the character is an uppercase English letter. If it is, you can use that character as the abbreviation. If not, you can continue iterating through the characters until you find an uppercase English letter. This will ensure that you are using the first uppercase English letter in the string as the abbreviation.

  Your approach is correct and clear. However, you could consider using a more concise and efficient approach to solve the problem.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a dynamic programming approach to compute the product of the given integers. This approach involves breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems and solving them recursively. By doing so, you can avoid the need for a loop and compute the product more efficiently. Additionally, you can use a data structure such as a hash table or a binary search tree to store the intermediate results, which can help reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.

  Your approach is good, but you can improve it by considering the case where N is a multiple of 1000. In this case, you can use infinitely many 1000-yen coins to pay N yen. This will help you avoid using the 1-yen coins to make up the difference.

Additionally, you can use the following formula to determine if E869120 can pay exactly N yen using only his 1-yen and 500-yen coins:

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to find the largest square number not exceeding N. One such algorithm is the "binary search" algorithm, which involves repeatedly dividing the range of possible square numbers in half and checking whether the midpoint is a square number. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(log N), which is much faster than the O(N) time complexity of your current approach. Additionally, you can use a more efficient data structure, such as a hash table or a balanced binary search tree, to store the square numbers and their corresponding square roots, which can help

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few things you could do to improve it. First, you could use a more efficient data structure to store the unique characters, such as a hash table or a bit vector. This would reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from O(n^2) to O(n), where n is the length of the input string. Additionally, you could use a more Pythonic way to iterate through the characters in the input string, such as using a list comprehension or the `enumerate` function.

  Your approach is good, but you can simplify the analysis by considering the case where the leader is the first person from the west. In this case, the first person from the west needs to face east and has to turn around, which means that the number of people who have to change their directions is 1. This is the best possible outcome, and it is the minimum number of people who have to change their directions. Therefore, you can skip the analysis for the case where the leader is the second person from the west and focus on the case where the leader is the first person from the west.

  Your approach is good, but you can improve it by using a more efficient data structure to store the connections between cities and roads. Instead of using a list to store the connections, you can use a dictionary where the keys are the cities and the values are the roads that connect to each city. This will allow you to quickly look up the connections between cities and roads, which can help you solve the problem more efficiently. Additionally, you can use a set to store the cities and roads, which will allow you to quickly check if a city or road is already in the set, which can help you avoid counting the same connection multiple times

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use an array instead of a map to store the relationship between the current weather and the expected weather for each day. This would make it easier to access the expected weather for a given current weather, as well as provide a more intuitive way to iterate through the cycle. Additionally, you could use a modulo operator to ensure that the index of the array is always within the bounds of the array, which would simplify the code and make it more readable.

  Your approach is correct, but there is a small mistake in the calculation of the expected value of the total execution time of the code. The correct formula is:

X \* (1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 +... + 1/(2^X))

This is a geometric series, and its sum is:

X \* (2 - 1/2^X)

Therefore, the expected value of the total execution time of the code is:

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use the built-in function `string.ascii_lowercase` to get the list of lowercase letters, rather than hardcoding the range of 97 to 123.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to find the median of the subarray X_1, X_2,..., X_{i-1}, X_{i+1},..., X_N. Instead of finding the median of the entire subarray, you can use a more efficient algorithm such as the "median of medians" algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(N) instead of O(N^2) for the general case. This will significantly reduce the time complexity of your algorithm and make it more efficient.

Here's an updated version of the code that uses a single if statement and the logical operator "&&":

  I would suggest that you consider using a more efficient algorithm to solve the problem. Instead of iterating through all possible combinations of doughnuts and Moto, you can use a greedy approach that starts with the largest doughnut and consumes as much Moto as possible while still meeting the condition that at least one doughnut of each kind is made. This approach will give you a good approximation of the maximum number of doughnuts that can be made.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a `defaultdict` instead of a regular dictionary.

In this case, AtCoDeer's statement about TopCoDeer's honesty would be false, and it would be difficult to determine the truth of TopCoDeer's honesty. To handle this case, you could consider using a more nuanced approach, such as considering the likelihood of AtCoDeer's statement being true given the information available.

As you move the window, you keep track of the maximum length of the substring that starts with A and ends with Z within the window. This approach will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from O(n) to O(1), where n is the length
