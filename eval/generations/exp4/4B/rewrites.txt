1. We are given an unweighted tree with $n$ vertices.
2. We need to choose three distinct vertices $a, b, c$ on this tree such that the number of edges which belong to at least one of the simple paths between $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $c$, or $a$ and $c$ is the maximum possible.

5. We need to find the vertices $a, b, c$ such that the number of edges which belong to at least one of the simple paths between $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $c$, or $a$ and $c$ is the maximum possible.

Let's start by finding the maximum number of edges which belong to at least one of the simple paths between $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $c$, or $a$ and $c$.

We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We can use a two-dimensional array to store the maximum number of edges which belong to at least one of the simple paths between $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $c$, or $a$ and $c$ for each pair of vertices $

First, we know that the list of divisors of $x$ and $y$ contains $n$ integers, where $n$ is the number of divisors of $x$ and $y$.

We also know that if a number is divisor of both numbers $x$ and $y$ then there are two copies of this number in the list.

So, we can start by finding the number of divisors of $x$ and $y$. We can do this by finding the number of unique divisors in the list.

Let's say the list of divisors of $x$ and $y$ is $L$. We can find the number of unique divisors in $L$ by using a hash table to keep track of the unique divisors. This will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from O(n log n) to O(n).

Once we have the number of unique divisors in $L$, we can find the number of divisors of $x$ and $y$ by dividing the number of unique divisors in $L$ by 2.

Now, we know the number of divisors of $x$ and $y$. We can use this information to find the numbers $x$ and $y$.

Let's say the list of divisors of $x$ and $y$ is $L$. We can find the numbers $x$ and $y$ by finding the two numbers in $L$ that have the most divisors

Let's consider the first row. We can choose no more than $\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor$ elements in this row. Let's say we choose $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor}$ elements in this row. The sum of these elements is $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_{\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor}$.

We need to find the maximum sum of elements in each row that is divisible by $k$. We can do this by finding the maximum sum of elements in each row that is divisible by $k$ and also the maximum number of elements in each row that are divisible by $k$. This will help you to find the optimal solution by considering both the sum and the number of elements in each row.

We can find $s$ by starting from the leftmost element of the given sequence and taking either the leftmost element or the rightmost element until we get a strictly increasing sequence.

We can do the same thing starting from the rightmost element of the given sequence.

We can find the longest strictly increasing sequence that is possible to obtain from the given sequence by taking either the leftmost element or the rightmost element by comparing the two sequences we get from the two methods.

First, we need to find the minimum value that can be added to all the elements of the array. We can do this by finding the minimum value in the array and then adding that value to all the elements.

Let's say the minimum value in the array is x. We can add x to all the elements of the array to make them all equal.

Now, we need to find the minimum value that can be subtracted from all the elements of the array. We can do this by finding the maximum value in the array and then subtracting that value from all the elements.

Let's say the maximum value in the array is y. We can subtract y from all the elements of the array to make them all equal.

Now, we need to find the minimum value that can be added to all the elements of the array and subtracted from all the elements of the array. We can do this by finding the minimum value that is common to all the elements of the array.

3. The bottom left corner of the first black sheet has coordinates $(x_3, y_3)$, and the top right — $(x_4, y_4)$.
4. The bottom left corner of the second black sheet has coordinates $(x_5, y_5)$, and the top right — $(x_6, y_6)$.

We need to determine if some part of the white sheet can be seen from the above after the two black sheets are placed. The part of the white sheet can be seen if there is at least one point lying strictly inside the white sheet and strictly inside both black sheets.

Let's consider the following cases:

1. If the white sheet is fully covered by the black sheets, then there is no part of the white sheet that can be seen from the above.
2. If the white sheet is not fully covered by the black sheets, then there is at least one point lying strictly inside the white sheet and strictly inside both black sheets.

To check if the white sheet is fully covered by the black sheets, we can check if the intersection of the white sheet and the two black sheets is empty. If the intersection is empty, then the white sheet is fully covered by the black sheets.

3. We need to find the number of different numbers that are reachable from $n$ after applying the function $f$ zero or more times.
4. We can apply the function $f$ to $n$ zero or more times, and each time we apply the function $f$, we get a number that is reachable from $n$.
5. Therefore, the number of different numbers that are reachable from $n$ is the number of different numbers that are reachable from $n$ after applying the function $f$ zero or more times.

Let's denote the number of different numbers that are reachable from $n$ after applying the function $f$ zero or more times as $f(n)$.

We can write the following recurrence relation:

$f(n) = f(f(n)) + 1$

This is because each time we apply the function $f$ to $n$, we get a number that is reachable from $n$, and we add 1 to the number of different numbers that are reachable from $n$ after 1 time.

We can use this recurrence relation to find the number of different numbers that are reachable from $n$. We can start

Next, we need to find out which friend wants to receive the gift from whom. We can do this by looking at the values of $f_i$. If $f_i = 0$, then the $i$-th friend doesn't know whom he wants to receive the gift from. If $f_i = j$, then the $i$-th friend wants to receive the gift from the $j$-th friend.

Now, we need to make sure that each friend gives exactly one gift and receives exactly one gift. We can do this by making sure that each friend is in the list of friends whom the $i$-th friend wants to give the gift to exactly once. We can also make sure that each friend is in the list of friends whom the $i$-th friend wants to receive the gift from exactly once.

Finally, we need to make sure that there is no friend who gives the gift to himself. We can do this by making sure that each friend is not in the list of friends whom the $i$-th friend wants to give the gift to.

4. If all elements are colored and for each $i$ from $1$ to $k$, there is at least one element colored in the $i$-th color, then we need to check if for each $i$ from $1$ to $k$, all elements colored in the $i$-th color are distinct.

1. We are given a huge decimal number consisting of $n$ digits. It is guaranteed that this number has no leading zeros. Each digit of this number is either 0 or 1.
2. We may perform several (possibly zero) operations with this number. During each operation we are allowed to change any digit of our number; we may change 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. It is possible that after some operation we can obtain a number with leading zeroes, but it does not matter for this problem.
3. We are also given two integers $0 \le y < x < n$. Our task is to calculate the minimum number of operations we should perform to obtain the number that has remainder $10^y$ modulo $10^x$. In other words, the obtained number should have remainder $10^y$ when divided by $10^x$.

Let's start with the first example. We are given the number $11010100101$. We need to find the minimum number of operations to obtain the number having remainder $100$ modulo $100000$.

We can start by performing the following operations:

1. Change the first digit (1) to 0.

1. First, we need to find the subsequence of length at least 3.
2. Then, we need to check if the subsequence is a palindrome.

Let's start with the first step. We can use a sliding window approach to find the subsequence of length at least 3. We can start with the first element of the array and move the window of size 3 to the right. We can keep moving the window until we reach the end of the array.

For example, let's consider the array [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1]. We can start with the first element of the array, which is 1. We can move the window of size 3 to the right and check if the subsequence is a palindrome.

The subsequence is [1, 2, 1]. We can move the window of size 3 to the right again and check if the subsequence is a palindrome.

The subsequence is [2, 1, 3]. We can move the window of size 3 to the right again and check if the subsequence is a palindrome.

We can continue this process until we reach the end of the array. If we find a subsequence that is a palindrome, we can return "YES". Otherwise, we can return "NO".

First, we need to understand the problem. We are given a long decimal number $a$ consisting of $n$ digits from $1$ to $9$. We also have a function $f$ that maps every digit from $1$ to $9$ to some (possibly the same) digit from $1$ to $9$.

We can perform the following operation no more than once: choose a non-empty contiguous subsegment of digits in $a$, and replace each digit $x$ from this segment with $f(x)$.

The question is, what is the maximum possible number we can obtain after applying this operation no more than once?

Let's consider an example. Suppose $a = 1337$, $f(1) = 1$, $f(3) = 5$, $f(7) = 3$, and we choose the segment consisting of three rightmost digits. We get $1553$ as the result.

Now, let's think about the maximum possible number we can obtain after applying this operation no more than once. We can apply this operation no more than once, so we need to find the maximum possible number we can obtain.

To do this, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can define a function $f(i, j)$ that returns the maximum possible number we can obtain by applying the operation no more than once on the subsegment of $a$ from index $i$ to index $j$.

3. Finally, we need to find the minimum possible instability by removing one element from the array.

Let's call the maximum value $M$, and the minimum value $m$. The instability is $M - m$.

We need to remove one element from the array, so we can either remove the maximum value or the minimum value. Let's call the removed element $x$.

If we remove the maximum value, the new maximum value is $x$, and the new minimum value is $m$. The new instability is $x - m$.

If we remove the minimum value, the new maximum value is $M$, and the new minimum value is $x$. The new instability is $M - x$.

So, the minimum possible instability is the minimum of the two instabilities we just calculated.

Therefore, the solution is to find the maximum and minimum values in the array, calculate the difference between them, and then find the minimum of the two instabilities we just calculated.

Let's start with the first condition. We know that the length of the string $s$ is at least $n$. So, we can start with a string $s$ of length $n$.

Now, let's think about the second condition. We want to construct a string $s$ of minimum possible length that there are exactly $k$ substrings of $s$ equal to $t$. We can start with a string $s$ of length $n$ and add $k$ substrings of $t$ to it.

1. The contest lasts an even number of minutes.
2. The entire contest is held during a single day.
3. The contest lasts at least two minutes.

We can start by finding the midpoint of the contest.

Let's assume the contest starts at $h_1:m_1$ and ends at $h_2:m_2$.

The midpoint of the contest is the time when the contest is halfway through.

We can calculate the midpoint by dividing the total number of minutes in the contest by 2.

Let's calculate the total number of minutes in the contest.

The total number of minutes in the contest is the difference between the end time and the start time.

$m_2 - m_1$

We can simplify this by using the modulo operator to get the difference between the end time and the start time in minutes.

$m_2 \% m_1$

We can simplify this further by using the modulo operator to get the midpoint of the contest in minutes.

$m_2 \% m_1 / 2$

We can simplify this further by using the modulo operator to get the midpoint of the contest in hours.

$h_2 \% h_1$

Therefore, the midpoint of the contest is $h_2 \% h_1:m_2 \% m_1$.

The input is a single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 64).

The problem is to find the number of digits in the binary representation of a.

To solve this problem, we can use a bitwise operation to count the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of a. We can do this by using the bitwise AND operator to count the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of a.

For example, if the input is 27, we can use the bitwise AND operator to count the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of 27. We can do this by performing the following steps:

1. Convert 27 to its binary representation: 27 = 100111
2. Count the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation: 100111 = 100100
3. The number of trailing zeros is 2.

Therefore, the output is 2.

In the examples given, the output is 1, 2, 5, and 6, respectively.

1. We are given $n$ segments on a number line. Each endpoint of every segment has integer coordinates. Some segments can degenerate to points. Segments can intersect with each other, be nested in each other or even coincide.
2. The intersection of a sequence of segments is such a maximal set of points (not necesserily having integer coordinates) that each point lies within every segment from the sequence. If the resulting set isn't empty, then it always forms some continuous segment. The length of the intersection is the length of the resulting segment or $0$ in case the intersection is an empty set.
3. For example, the intersection of segments $[1;5]$ and $[3;10]$ is $[3;5]$ (length $2$), the intersection of segments $[1;5]$ and $[5;7]$ is $[5;5]$ (length $0$), and the intersection of segments $[1;5]$ and $[6;6]$ is an empty set (length $0$).

Now, let's update your approach.

1. Polycarp has a cat and his cat is a real gourmet!
2. Dependent on a day of the week he eats certain type of food: on Mondays, Thursdays and Sundays he eats fish food; on Tuesdays and Saturdays he eats rabbit stew; on other days of week he eats chicken stake.
3. Polycarp plans to go on a trip and already packed his backpack. His backpack contains $a$ daily rations of fish food; $b$ daily rations of rabbit stew; $c$ daily rations of chicken stakes.
4. Polycarp has to choose such day of the week to start his trip that his cat can eat without additional food purchases as long as possible.

Let's start with the first day of the trip. If Polycarp chooses a day of the week when his cat eats fish food, then his cat can eat without additional food purchases for $a$ days.

Let's start with the first step.

We can place the tiles in a square of size $m \times m$ such that each cell of the square is covered with exactly one tile cell, by using a backtracking algorithm. This algorithm should start by placing the first tile in the top-left corner of the square, and then recursively place the remaining tiles in the remaining cells of the square, ensuring that each cell is covered by exactly one tile and that the sides of the tiles are

1. We are given an integer sequence $1, 2, \dots, n$.
2. We have to divide it into two sets $A$ and $B$ in such a way that each element belongs to exactly one set and $|sum(A) - sum(B)|$ is minimum possible.
3. The value $|x|$ is the absolute value of $x$ and $sum(S)$ is the sum of elements of the set $S$.

Now, let's think about the problem. We have to divide the sequence into two sets such that the difference between the sum of elements in set $A$ and the sum of elements in set $B$ is minimum.

Let's consider the first $k$ elements of the sequence, where $k$ is a small positive integer. For each $k$, calculate the minimum difference between the sum of elements in set $A$ and the sum of elements in set $B$ for the first $k$ elements of the sequence.

Repeat step 2 for different values of $k$ until you find the minimum difference.

This approach can help you avoid considering the entire sequence at once, which can make the problem easier to solve.

First, we need to define what a regular bracket sequence is. A regular bracket sequence is a string containing only characters '(' and ')'.

Next, we need to define what a regular bracket sequence of length $2n$ is. A regular bracket sequence of length $2n$ is a string containing only characters '(' and ')', and the length of the string is equal to $2n$.

Now, we need to define what a substring is. A substring is a sequence of characters that is contained within another sequence of characters.

Finally, we need to define what a regular bracket sequence containing a substring is. A regular bracket sequence containing a substring is a regular bracket sequence that contains the given bracket sequence $s$ as a substring.

Now, let's think about the problem. We are given a bracket sequence $s$ (not necessarily a regular one). We need to calculate the number of regular bracket sequences of length $2n$ containing the given bracket sequence $s$ as a substring (consecutive sequence of characters) modulo $10^9+7$ ($1000000007$).

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can break down the problem into smaller sub-problems, and use the solutions to these sub-problems to solve the original problem more efficiently.

First, we need to find the minimum number of colors that we need to color the string so that it can be sorted. We can do this by finding the number of distinct characters in the string.

Let's call the number of distinct characters $k$. We need to color each character to a different color, so we need at least $k$ colors.

Now, we need to find the minimum number of colors that we need to color the string so that it can be sorted using some sequence of swaps. We can do this by finding the number of pairs of neighboring characters that are colored different colors.

Let's call the number of pairs of neighboring characters that are colored different colors $p$. We need to color each character to a different color, so we need at least $p$ colors.

Now, we need to find the minimum number of colors that we need to color the string so that it can be sorted using some sequence of swaps. We can do this by finding the minimum of $k$ and $p$.

Let's call the minimum of $k$ and $p$ $m$. We need to color each character to a different color, so we need at least $m$ colors.

Let's move on to the second condition. We need to check if all the strings are substrings of each other in the correct order. We can do this by checking if each string is a substring of the previous string. If any string is not a substring of the previous string, then we can print "NO" and stop.

Let's move on to the third condition. We need to print "YES" and the strings in the correct order. We can do this by printing the strings in the order in which they appear in the input.

2. The amount of consumption tax levied on it is rounded down to the nearest integer.
3. The consumption tax rate is 8 percent or 10 percent.
4. The amount of consumption tax is A yen or B yen, respectively.

We need to find the price of the product before tax such that the amount of consumption tax levied on it is A yen or B yen, respectively.

Let's consider the case where the consumption tax rate is 8 percent.

The amount of consumption tax levied on the product is:

\lfloor 25 \times 0.08 \rfloor = \lfloor 2 \rfloor = 2 yen.

The price of the product before tax is:

25 - 2 = 23 yen.

Let's consider the case where the consumption tax rate is 10 percent.

The amount of consumption tax levied on the product is:

\lfloor 25 \times 0.1 \rfloor = \lfloor 2.5 \rfloor = 2 yen.

The price of the product before tax is:

2. We need to find the length of the longest substring of $s$ that is a subsequence of $t$.

Let's start with the first step. We need to find the longest substring of $s$ that is a subsequence of $t$.

We can use a hash table to keep track of the characters in $t$ and their corresponding indices in $s$. We can then iterate through the characters of $s$ and check if each character is in the hash table. If it is, we can add it to the hash table and update the longest substring of $s$ that is a subsequence of $t$.

We can keep track of the longest substring of $s$ that is a subsequence of $t$ by keeping a variable $longest$ that stores the length of the longest substring we have found so far.

For example, if x = 1.200000, then y = 1.

So, the output for x = 1.200000 is 3 2.

First, we need to construct an undirected tree on $n$ vertices with diameter $d$ and degree of each vertex at most $k$.

We can start by constructing a tree with diameter $d$ and degree of each vertex at most $k$. We can do this by creating a tree with $n$ vertices and connecting each vertex to $k$ other vertices.

For example, if $n = 6$, $d = 3$, and $k = 3$, we can create a tree with the following structure:

1 - 2
| |
3 - 4
| |
5 - 6

This tree has diameter $3$ and degree of each vertex at most $3$.

Now, we need to make sure that this tree is connected. We can do this by connecting the vertices in a way that creates a path of length $d$ between any two vertices.

For example, if we want to connect the vertices 1 and 2, we can connect them by adding an edge between them. This will create a path of length $1$ between the vertices 1 and 2.

We can continue this process until we have a connected tree with the desired diameter and degree constraints.

Let's call the sum of the elements in each block $s$. We can write a program to find the maximum sum $s$ and the indices of the elements that make up each block.

Here is a possible solution:

1. Initialize a variable $s$ to 0.
2. Initialize a variable $i$ to 1.
3. While $i \leq n$:
	* If $a[i] + s > 0$:
		+ Add $a[i]$ to $s$.
		+ Add $i$ to the set of indices for the current block.
	* Else:
		+ If $s > 0$:
			- Print the current block.
			- Reset $s$ to 0.
			- Reset the set of indices for the current block to empty.
	+ Increment $i$.

This approach should be more efficient than the previous one, as it avoids having to iterate through the entire array multiple times. It also avoid

1. We are given two strings $s$ and $t$.
2. Both strings have length $n$ and consist of lowercase Latin letters.
3. The characters in the strings are numbered from $1$ to $n$.
4. We can successively perform the following move any number of times (possibly, zero): swap any two adjacent (neighboring) characters of $s$ (i.e. for any $i = \{1, 2, \dots, n - 1\}$ you can swap $s_i$ and $s_{i + 1})$.
5. We can't apply a move to the string $t$.
6. The moves are applied to the string $s$ one after another.
7. Our task is to obtain the string $t$ from the string $s$.
8. Find any way to do it with at most $10^4$ such moves.

Let's start with the first example.

We are given the string $s = "abcdef"$ and the string $t = "abdfec"$.

We can see that the first character of $s$ is "a", and the first character of $t$ is "a". We can swap the first two characters of $s$ and $t$ to get the strings $s = "bacdef"$ and $t = "abdfec"$.

We can see that the second character of $s

1. We know that the string has length $n$ and consists only of lowercase Latin letters.
2. We know that the string has $2n-2$ substrings, which are either prefixes or suffixes.
3. We know that each substring is a string of length from $1$ to $n-1$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.
4. We know that there are exactly $2$ strings of each length from $1$ to $n-1$.
5. We know that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $n$.

Now, let's think about the problem. We need to find a string of length $2n-2$ that consists only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $i$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $i$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.

Let's start with the first character of the string. We know that the first substring is either a prefix or a suffix. If it is a prefix, then the first character of the string should be 'P'. If it is a suffix, then the first character of the string should be 'S'.

Next, we can use a hash table to keep track of the prefixes and suffixes. We can store the prefixes and suffixes in the hash table, and use

The first line of the input contains several space-separated integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100).

The problem asks us to find the minimum number of operations needed to transform the given integers into a single integer.

The given integers are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

We can see that the sum of these integers is 30.

The problem states that we need to find the minimum number of operations needed to transform the given integers into a single integer.

So, we need to find the minimum number of operations needed to transform 30 into a single integer.

The problem also states that we need to use the following operations:

I Aqua Fortis

I Aqua Regia

II Amalgama

VII Minium

IV Vitriol

We can see that the given integers can be transformed into a single integer by using the following operations:

I Aqua Fortis: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30

I Aqua Regia: 2 + 4

So, the minimum number of operations needed to transform the given integers into a single integer is 2.

Therefore, the output should be 2.

1. We know that the house has $n$ flats, and each flat has a light.

3. Vova thinks that people in the $i$-th flats are disturbed and cannot sleep if and only if $1 < i < n$ and $a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} = 1$ and $a_i = 0$.
4. Vova is concerned by the following question: what is the minimum number $k$ such that if people from exactly $k$ pairwise distinct flats will turn off the lights then nobody will be disturbed?

Let's start by finding the minimum number of flats that need to turn off the lights.

We know that if $1 < i < n$ and $a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} = 1$ and $a_i = 0$, then people in the $i$-th flat are disturbed.

So, we need to find the minimum number of flats that satisfy the above condition.

Let's consider the following cases:

Case 1: $a_1 = a_n = 0$

In this case, there is no need to turn off the lights in any flat, as there are no disturbed people.

Case 2: $a_1 = a_n = 1$

First, we need to find the common divisors of all elements in the array. We can do this by finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of each pair of elements.

For example, in the first test case, the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. We can find the gcd of each pair of elements as follows:

gcd(1, 2) = 1
gcd(2, 3) = 1
gcd(3, 4) = 1
gcd(4, 5) = 1

So, the common divisors of all elements in the array are 1 and 2.

Now, we need to find the number of common divisors. In this case, there are 2 common divisors: 1 and 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2.

In the second test case, the array is [6, 90, 12, 18, 30, 18]. We can find the gcd of each pair of elements as follows:

gcd(6, 90) = 12
gcd(90, 12) = 3
gcd(12, 18) = 6
gcd(18, 30) = 6
gcd(30, 18) = 6

2. We can use a hash table to keep track of the coins that have been distributed.
3. We can iterate through the coins and distribute them into pockets.
4. We can check if the current coin has been distributed into a pocket. If it has, we can skip it. If not, we can distribute it into a new pocket.
5. We can increment the number of pockets by 1 if we distribute a new coin into a new pocket.
6. We can print the minimum number of pockets that Polycarp needs to distribute all the coins so no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.

Let's implement this solution in Python.

2. Next, we need to find the range of each heater. We can do this by looking at the value of the heater and finding the range of elements that it can warm up.
3. Now we need to find the minimum number of heaters needed to warm up the whole house. We can do this by looking at the range of each heater and finding the minimum number of heaters needed to warm up the whole house.

Let's consider an example.

Suppose we have an array of size 6 and the value of the heaters is 2. The positions of the heaters are 2 and 5. The range of the first heater is [1; 3] and the range of the second heater is [5; 6].

To warm up the whole house, we need to turn on all the heaters. So, the answer is 3.

Now, let's consider another example.

Suppose we have an array of size 5 and the value of the heaters is 3. The positions of the heaters are 1, 3, and 5. The range of the first heater is [1; 3], the range of the second heater is [3; 5], and the range of the third heater is [5

First, we need to find the number of tuples (A, B, C) of positive integers that satisfy A \times B + C = N.

We can start by finding the number of tuples (A, B) of positive integers that satisfy A \times B = N.

We can do this by finding the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that are divisible by 2.

For example, if N = 3, then the number of positive integers less than or equal to 3 that are divisible by 2 is 2.

So, the number of tuples (A, B) of positive integers that satisfy A \times B = N is 2.

Now, we need to find the number of tuples (A, B, C) of positive integers that satisfy A \times B + C = N.

We can do this by finding the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that are not divisible by 2.

For example, if N = 3, then the number of positive integers less than or equal to 3 that are not divisible by 2 is 1.

So, the number of tuples (A, B, C) of positive integers that satisfy A \times B + C = N is 3.

Therefore, the number of tuples (A, B, C) of positive integers that satisfy A \times B + C = N is 3.

First, we need to understand what a regular bracket sequence is. A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters '1' and '+' between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "()()", "(())" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)", "((1+1)+1)"), and ")(" and "(" are not.

Now, let's consider the problem. We are given a bracket sequence $s$ consisting of $n$ opening '(' and closing ')' brackets. We need to calculate the number of positions $i$ such that if we change the type of the $i$-th bracket, then the resulting bracket sequence becomes regular.

Let's start with a simple case. If the bracket sequence is already regular, then we don't need to change anything, so the answer is 0.

Now, let's consider the case when the bracket sequence is not regular. We need to find the positions $i$ such that if we change the type of the $i$-th bracket, then the resulting bracket sequence becomes regular. We can do this by using a dynamic programming approach.

Let's create a 2D array $dp$ where $dp[i][j]$ represents the number of regular bracket sequences of length $j$ that can be formed by changing the type of the $i$-th bracket

3. We can remove the substring $s[l;r]$ such that $t$ is still a subsequence of $s$.
4. We need to find the maximum possible length of the substring $s[l;r]$.

Let's consider the following example:

$s = "bbaba"$
$t = "bb"$

We can remove the substring $s[2;4]$ such that $t$ is still a subsequence of $s$.

$s_1 = "bb"$
$s_2 = "a"$

Now, $t$ is still a subsequence of $s$.

So, the maximum possible length of the substring we can remove is $3$.

Therefore, the output is $3$.

4. We know that a ≤ x ≤ b and c ≤ y ≤ d.
5. We can find the maximum possible value of x by finding the largest integer that is less than or equal to b.
6. We can find the maximum possible value of y by finding the largest integer that is less than or equal to d.
7. We can then multiply the maximum possible value of x and y to get the maximum possible value of x \* y.

So, the solution is to find the maximum possible value of x and y, and then multiply them to get the maximum possible value of x \* y.

Let's call the least common multiple of all pairs of numbers in the array that have indices $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \le i < j \le n$ as $lcm(a, i, j)$.

A balanced ternary string is a ternary string such that the number of characters '0' in this string is equal to the number of characters '1', and the number of characters '1' (and '0' obviously) is equal to the number of characters '2'.

Now, we need to find the minimum number of characters to replace in the given string to obtain a balanced ternary string. We can do this by counting the number of characters in the string.

Let's say the given string is $s = "abc"$. We can replace the first character 'a' with '0' to obtain a balanced ternary string. The new string will be $s' = "0bc"$.

Now, we need to find the minimum number of characters to replace in the string $s'$. We can do this by counting the number of characters in the string $s'$.

Let's say the string $s'$ is $s' = "0bc"$. We can replace the first character 'b' with '1' to obtain a balanced ternary string. The new string will be $s'' = "01c"$.

1. First, we need to sort the sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ in non-decreasing order. We can use the quicksort algorithm to do this.
2. Once the sequence is sorted, we can find the median of the sequence. If the length of the sequence is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. If the length of the sequence is odd, the median is the middle element.
3. If the value of the median is equal to $m$, then we have found a suitable pair of indices $(l, r)$. We can count the number of such pairs by keeping track of the number of times the median is equal to $m$ as we iterate through the sequence.

Here is the updated code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    int a[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    sort(a, a + n);
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] == m) {
            count++;
        }
    }

1. First, we need to find the maximum possible value of the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array.
2. Then, we need to find the number of segments that we need to apply to the array to get the maximum possible value of the difference.
3. Finally, we need to find the indices of the segments that we need to apply to the array to get the maximum possible value of the difference.

Let's start with the first step. We need to find the maximum possible value of the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array.

Let's call the maximum value of the array $M$ and the minimum value of the array $m$.

The difference between $M$ and $m$ is $M - m$.

We need to find the maximum possible value of $M - m$.

Let's consider two cases:

Case 1: If $M > m$, then the maximum possible value of $M - m$ is $M - m$.

Case 2: If $m > M$, then the maximum possible value of $M - m$ is $0$.

In either case, we can see that the maximum possible value of $M - m$ is $M - m$.

Now, let's move on to the second step. We need to find the number of segments that we need to apply to the array to get the maximum possible value of the difference.

First, we need to define what a diverse string is. A string is diverse if it contains consecutive (adjacent) letters of the Latin alphabet and each letter occurs exactly once. For example, the following strings are diverse: "fced", "xyz", "r" and "dabcef". The following string are not diverse: "az", "aa", "bad" and "babc".

Now, let's think about how to check if a string is diverse. We can start by checking if the string contains consecutive letters. We can do this by checking if the string has at least two letters. If it does, we can check if the first letter is followed by the second letter. If it is, we can check if the second letter is followed by the third letter. If it is, we can continue this process until we reach the end of the string. If we find a gap in the sequence of letters, we know that the string is not diverse.

Next, we need to check if each letter in the string occurs exactly once. We can do this by creating a hash table where the keys are the letters in the string and the values are the counts of each letter. If the count of each letter is 1, we know that the string is diverse. If the count of any letter is greater than 1, we know that the string is not diverse.

Finally, we can use the hash table to check if the string is diverse. We can do this by iterating through the hash table and

2. Then, we need to find the number of segments that we need to apply to the array.
3. Finally, we need to find the indices of the segments that we need to apply to the array.

Let's start with the first step. We can find the maximum and minimum values of the array by using a single pass through the array. We can use two variables, `max` and `min`, to keep track of the maximum and minimum values, respectively.

Here is the updated code:
```
def find_max_min(arr):
    max = None
    min = None
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if max is None or arr[i] > max:

1. We can remove at most one element from the array.
2. The final length of the array is $n-1$, $n$, or $n-2$.
3. The maximum possible length of the strictly increasing contiguous subarray of the array $a$ after removing at most one element is $n-1$, $n$, or $n-2$.

Let's consider the case where the final length of the array is $n-1$.

1. We can remove $a_3=5$.
2. The resulting array will be equal to $[1, 2, 3, 4]$.
3. The length of its largest increasing subarray will be equal to $4$.

Let's consider the case where the final length of the array is $n$.

1. First, we need to find the minimum number of operations required to obtain at least $k$ equal numbers in the array.
2. We can use a hash table or a binary search tree to keep track of the numbers in the first part of the array. This will allow us to quickly check if a number is already in the table and avoid unnecessary operations.
3. We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. We can start by initializing a two-dimensional array $dp$ with the following values:

$$dp[i][j] = \begin{cases}
\infty & \text{if } i < j \\
0 & \text{if } i = j \\
1 & \text{if } i > j
\end{cases}$$

This array represents the minimum number of operations required to obtain at least $j$ equal numbers in the first $i$ elements of the array.

4. We can then iterate through the array and update the values in $dp$ as follows:

$$dp[i][j] = \min\left(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + 1\right)$$

This formula says that the minimum number of operations required to obtain at least $j$ equal numbers in the first $i$ elements of the array is the minimum of the following two values:

Let's denote the number of blue balls in the first N balls as B1.

1. First, we need to find the duplicates in the array.
2. Then, we need to remove the duplicates.
3. Finally, we need to print the remaining unique elements in the array.

Let's start with step 1. We can use a hash table to store the unique elements in the array. We can use the value of each element as the key and the frequency of the element in the array as the value.

For example, if the array is [1, 5, 5, 1, 6, 1], we can use a hash table like this:

{1: 2, 5: 2, 6: 1}

This means that the element 1 appears twice in the array, the element 5 appears twice, and the element 6 appears once.

Now, let's move on to step 2. We need to remove the duplicates. We can use the hash table to find the duplicates.

For example, if we want to remove the duplicates in the array [1, 5, 5, 1, 6, 1], we can use the hash table to find the duplicates. We can see that the element 5 appears twice in the array, so we need to remove both of them. We can also see that the element 1 appears twice in the array, so we need to remove both of them.

After removing the duplicates, the array will look like this: [5

1. If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3.
2. If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 4, then the number itself is divisible by 4.

Polycarp wants to find the nearest larger or equal interesting number for the given number a.

Let's consider the following cases:

1. If the sum of the digits of a is divisible by 4, then the number itself is divisible by 4.

In this case, we can find the nearest larger or equal interesting number for a by adding 1 to the number a.

2. If the sum of the digits of a is not divisible by 4, then the number itself is not divisible by 4.

In this case, we can find the nearest larger or equal interesting number for a by adding 1 to the number a until we get a number that is divisible by 4.

Let's consider an example:

The sum of the digits of a is 4 + 3 + 2

1. We know that the string $s$ contains only lowercase Latin letters ('a'-'z').
2. We also know that the string $t$ is obtained from $s$ by erasing some letters (possibly zero) and then writing the rest in any order.
3. We are given an array $b$ of integers, where $b_i$ is the sum of the distances $|i-j|$ from the index $i$ to all such indices $j$ that $t_j > t_i$.
4. We need to find any possible string $t$ for which the following two requirements are fulfilled simultaneously: $t$ is obtained from $s$ by erasing some letters (possibly zero) and then writing the rest in any order; the array, constructed from the string $t$ according to the rules above, equals to the array $b$ specified in the input data.

Let's start with the second requirement. We need to find a string $t$ such that the array $b$ constructed from $t$ is equal to the array $b$ specified in the input data.

We can start by finding a string $t$ that satisfies the first requirement. We can use a backtracking algorithm to find all possible strings $t$ that can be formed from the letters in $s$. For each string $t$, we can calculate the array $b$ constructed from $t$ and compare it with the given array $b$. If the arrays are

This approach uses a recursive function to generate the names, which reduces the number of iterations required to generate the names and improves the efficiency of the algorithm. Additionally, a hash table is used to store the names of the dogs, which allows for quick lookups of the names given a dog's number. This reduces the time complexity of the algorithm and makes it more efficient.

3. We need to find the minimum length of the text after the abbreviation.

Let's start with the first step. We need to find the minimum length of the text after at most one abbreviation.

Let's consider the text "to be or not to be". We can replace the segment of words "to be" with the string "TB" and obtain the text "TB or not TB". The length of the text after the abbreviation is 12.

Let's consider the text "a ab a a b ab a a b c". We can replace the segments of words "ab a a b" and "ab a a b" with the strings "AAA" and "BBB" respectively and obtain the text "a AAA b BBB c". The length of the text after the abbreviation is 13.

Let's consider the text "aa bb aa aa bb bb".

Now, let's find the first uppercase letters of the words in the segments.

Let's think about the profit of each day.

1. The profit of the $j$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $j$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $l$ to $r$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $\max\limits_{l \le i \le r}a_i$).

We can start with the first element and move the window to the right. At each step, we check if the sum of the elements in the window is equal to $0$.

1. Takahashi loves the number 7 and multiples of K.
2. Where is the first occurrence of a multiple of K in the sequence 7,77,777,...?
3. If the sequence contains no multiples of K, print -1 instead.

We can solve this problem by using the `next()` function to find the first occurrence of a multiple of K in the sequence. Here is the updated pseudocode:

1. Read K from the input.
2. Initialize a variable to 1 (since the first number in the sequence is 7).
3. Use the `next()` function to find the first occurrence of a multiple of K in the sequence.
4. If the `next()` function returns a value, print the position of the current number.
5. If the `next()` function returns None, print -1.

k = int(input())
position = 1
while True:

    position += 1
else:

We need to find the minimum number of points Takahashi needs on the final subject to achieve his goal.

Let's denote the average score of Takahashi on the N subjects as Y.

We know that Y = (A_1 + A_2 +... + A_{N-1} + A_N) / N

We also know that Takahashi needs to achieve the average score of M points or above on the N subjects.

So, we can write the equation:

Y >= M

We also know that Takahashi has already taken exams on N-1 subjects and scored A_i points on the i-th subject.

So, we can write the equation:

A_1 + A_2 +... + A_{N-1} = X * (N-1)

where X is the average score of Takahashi on the N-1 subjects.

First, we need to understand the problem. We are given a binary matrix $a$ of size $n \times m$. We can perform some operations with this matrix. During each operation, we can inverse the row of this matrix or a column of this matrix.

The problem is to sort the initial matrix by some sequence of such operations. The matrix is considered sorted if the array $[a_{1, 1}, a_{1, 2}, \dots, a_{1, m}, a_{2, 1}, a_{2, 2}, \dots, a_{2, m}, \dots, a_{n, m - 1}, a_{n, m}]$ is sorted in non-descending order.

Now, let's think about the solution. We can use a greedy algorithm to solve this problem.

We start with the first row of the matrix. We can either inverse the first row or not inverse the first row. If we inverse the first row, we can sort the first row in non-descending order. If we don't inverse the first row, we can sort the first row in non-ascending order.

We repeat the same process for each row of the matrix. For each row, we can either inverse the row or not inverse the row. If we inverse the row, we can sort the row in non-descending order. If we don't inverse the row, we can sort the row in non-ascending order.

1. The input is a string of digits.
2. The length of the string is between 1 and 10, inclusive.
3. The output is "Yes" or "No".

We need to check if the string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.

Let's break down the input string into two parts: the first half and the second half.

1. The first half is the first half of the input string, which is the first half of the string.
2. The second half is the second half of the input string, which is the last half of the string.

We need to check if the first half and the second half are the same. If they are the same, then the input string is a palindrome.

Let's use an example to illustrate the solution.

Input: 373

First half: 37

Second half: 37

The first half and the second half are the same, so the input string is a palindrome.

Output: Yes

Now, let's use the Manacher's algorithm to check if the input string is a palindrome.

Input: 373

First half: 37

Second half: 37

We can use the Manacher's algorithm to check if the first half

The problem is to evaluate an arithmetic expression and return the result. The expression will contain between 2 and 10 operands, separated with arithmetic signs plus and/or minus. Each operand will be an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.

The reference solution is incorrect. It is subtracting the result of the expression from 0, which is not correct.

The correct solution is to evaluate the expression and return the result.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. Evaluate the expression.
2. Return the result.

To evaluate the expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). We need to first evaluate the operands, then the operators.

For example, in the expression 8-7+6-5+4-3+2-1-0, we need to first evaluate the operands:

8 - 7 = 1
1 + 6 = 7
7 - 5 = 2
2 + 4 = 6
6 - 3 = 3
3 + 2 = 5
5 - 1 = 4

First, we need to find a way to assign colors to each dancer's costume. We can do this by assigning each dancer a color from 1 to k.

Next, we need to make sure that each pair has a unique color combination. We can do this by assigning each pair a unique color combination.

Finally, we need to make sure that there are no two consecutive pairs with the same color combination. We can do this by assigning each pair a color combination that is different from the previous pair.

Let's look at some examples to see how this works.

In the first example, we have 4 pairs and 3 colors. We can assign colors as follows:

* Pair 1: Man 1, Woman 2

Let's start by finding the center coordinates. We know that the center coordinates are integers between 0 and 100 (inclusive). We can use this information to narrow down the possible values of C_X and C_Y.

Let's consider the possible values of C_X. Since C_X is an integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive), we know that C_X can take on any value between 0 and 100. We can use this information to find the possible values of C_X.

Let's consider the possible values of C_Y. Since C_Y is an integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive), we know that C_Y can take on any value between 0 and 100. We can use this information to find the possible values of C_Y.

Now that we have found the possible values of C_X and C_Y, we can use a hash table to store the coordinates of the points on the pyramid and their corresponding altitudes. This will reduce the space complexity of our algorithm and make it more efficient.

2. We need to find the maximum number of unique weights in a team.
3. We need to find the maximum number of unique weights in a team that is less than or equal to the number of boxers.

Let's call the maximum number of unique weights in a team that is less than or equal to the number of boxers as $m$.

We can start by sorting the weights in non-decreasing order.

Let's call the weight of the $i$-th boxer as $a_i$.

We can start by considering the first boxer.

If the weight of the first boxer is $a_1$, we can add it to the team.

If the weight of the first boxer is not $a_1$, we can add it to the team if the weight of the first boxer is less than or equal to $a_1 + 1$.

We can continue this process for each boxer.

If the weight of the $i$-th boxer is $a_i$, we can add it to the team if the weight of the $(i-1)$-th boxer is less than or equal to $a_i + 1$.

We can continue this process until we have added all the boxers to the team.

Once we have added all the boxers to the team, we can check if the number

You can move to the right or to the bottom only. Formally, from the cell ($i, j$) you may move to the cell ($i, j + 1$) or to the cell ($i + 1, j$). The target cell can't be outside of the grid.  The xor of all the numbers on the path from the cell ($1, 1$) to the cell ($n, m$) must be equal to $k$ (xor operation is the bitwise exclusive OR, it is represented as '^' in Java or C++ and "xor" in Pascal).

4. We can then reverse the substring $t[1 \dots d]$ for each divisor $d$ of $n$ in decreasing order.
5. We can continue this process until we reach the end of the string $t$.
6. We can stop when we reach the end of the string $t$.

This approach is more efficient because it only reverses the substring $t[1 \dots d]$ for each divisor $d$ of $n$ in decreasing order, rather than reversing the entire string $t$ and then reversing the substring $t[1 \dots d]$ for each divisor $d$ of $n$ in decreasing order. This reduces the number of operations required to find the decrypted string $s$.

1. The first thing we need to do is to understand the sequence. It is a sequence of blocks of consecutive numbers. The first block consists of all numbers from 1 to 1, the second one — from 1 to 2, the third one — from 1 to 3, and so on.
2. The second thing we need to do is to understand the position of each element in the sequence. The first element of the sequence is 1, the second element is 2, the third element is 3, and so on.
3. Now we need to understand how to calculate the digit at the position $k_i$ of the sequence. We can do it by counting the number of elements in the previous blocks. For example, if $k_i = 1$, then the digit at the position 1 is 1, because the first block consists of all numbers from 1 to 1. If $k_i = 20$, then the digit at the position 20 is 5, because the 20th element of the sequence is 5.

Now let's think about how to solve the problem. We need to write a program that can calculate the digit at a given position in the sequence. We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We can use a 2D array to store the values of the sequence and their corresponding positions. We can then use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the digit at each position.

3. We want to repaint some of the tiles black or white, so that any two adjacent tiles have different colors.
4. We need to find the minimum number of tiles that need to be repainted to satisfy the condition.

Let's consider a few examples:

Example 1:
S = 000

In this case, we can satisfy the condition by repainting the middle tile white.

Example 2:
S = 010

In this case, we can satisfy the condition by repainting the middle tile black.

Example 3:
S = 101

In this case, we can satisfy the condition by repainting the middle tile white.

Now, let's think about the general case.

We can start by finding the number of black tiles in the string S.

Let's consider the following example:
S = 01010

In this case, we have 2 black tiles.

We can use a bit vector to store the colors of each tile.

Therefore, we can print "Yes" as the answer.

If the string S is "RUDLUDRR", then we cannot satisfy both conditions. For example, the character in the 7-th position is R, which does not satisfy the first condition.

3. We want to find the number of sequences that satisfy all the conditions.

Let's start with the first condition. We know that each element is between 0 and 9, so we can have 10 possible values for each element.

Let's consider the second condition. We know that there exists an element that is equal to 0, so we can have 9 possible values for the other elements.

Let's consider the third condition. We know that there exists an element that is equal to 9, so we can have 9 possible values for the other elements.

Now, let's think about how many sequences we can have. We can have 10 possible values for each element, and we have N elements. So, the total number of sequences is 10^N.

However, we need to remove the sequences that don't satisfy the second and third conditions. We can do this by using the principle of inclusion and exclusion. We can calculate the number of sequences that satisfy the second condition (there exists an element that is equal to 0) as 9^N, and the number of sequences that satisfy the third condition (there exists an element that is equal to 9) as

2. We would like to make this sequence /\/\/\/ by replacing some of its elements.
3. We need to find the minimum number of elements that needs to be replaced.

Let's start by analyzing the conditions of the sequence being /\/\/\/.

1. For each i = 1,2,..., n-2, a_i = a_{i+2}.
2. Exactly two different numbers appear in the sequence.

From the first condition, we can see that the sequence is made up of two identical sub-sequences of length 2. For example, if the sequence is 3,1,3,2, then the sub-sequences are 3,1 and 3,2.

From the second condition, we can see that the sequence has exactly two different numbers, which are 1 and 3.

Now, let's think about how we can make the sequence /\/\/\/. We can do this by replacing one of the elements in the sequence with a different number. For example, we can replace the fourth element to make it 3,1,3,1.

4. For that, we can use the following three kinds of magics any number:
 - Extension Magic: Consumes 1 MP (magic point). Choose one bamboo and increase its length by 1.
 - Shortening Magic: Consumes 1 MP. Choose one bamboo of length at least 2 and decrease its length by 1.

3. We need to shift each character of S by N in alphabetical order.
4. We can do this by using a loop to iterate through each character of S and shift it by N.
5. We can use the modulo operator (%) to wrap around the alphabet.

Here is an example of how we can implement this:

```
const int ALPHABET_SIZE = 26;

string shift(string s, int n) {
    string result = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        char c = s[i];
        int newIndex = (c - 'A' + n) % ALPHABET_SIZE;
        result += (char)('A' + newIndex);
    }
    return result;
}
```

This approach uses a constant to represent the number of characters in the alphabet, which is 26 in this case. This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain. Additionally, we use a hash map to store the mapping of characters to their corresponding indices, which will make the code more efficient and easier to understand.

First, we know that each element of $a$ is not less than $2$ and not greater than $2 \cdot 10^5$. So, we can start by assuming that $a$ is an array of $n$ integers, where each integer is between $2$ and $2 \cdot 10^5$.

Next, we know that $b$ is formed from $a$ using the following sequence of operations:

1. Let $b$ be equal to $a$.
2. For each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, if $a_i$ is a prime number, then one integer $p_{a_i}$ is appended to $b$, where $p$ is an infinite sequence of prime numbers ($2, 3, 5, \dots$).
3. Otherwise (if $a_i$ is not a prime number), the greatest divisor of $a_i$ which is not equal to $a_i$ is appended to $b$.

We can start by assuming that $a$ is an array of $n$ prime numbers. We can then use the second operation to append the prime numbers to $b$. This will help us to reduce the number of possible values for each element of $a$.

Next, we can use the third operation to append the greatest divisors of $a_i$ which are not equal to $a_i$ to $b$. This will help us to further reduce the

First, we need to understand what is monotonic renumeration.

Monotonic renumeration is an array $b$ consisting of $n$ integers such that all of the following conditions are met:

$b_1 = 0$;  for every pair of indices $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \le i, j \le n$, if $a_i = a_j$, then $b_i = b_j$ (note that if $a_i \ne a_j$, it is still possible that $b_i = b_j$);  for every index $i \in [1, n - 1]$ either $b_i = b_{i + 1}$ or $b_i + 1 = b_{i + 1}$. 

For example, if $a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]$, then two possible monotonic renumerations of $a$ are $b = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$ and $b = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]$.

Now, we can use dynamic programming to solve the problem. We can use a hash table to store the monotonic renumerations of the array. We can start by initializing the hash table with the first element of the array. We can then iterate through the rest of the array, and for each element, we can check if

1. We have N cubes stacked vertically on a desk.
2. We are given a string S of length N. The color of the i-th cube from the bottom is red if the i-th character in S is 0, and blue if that character is 1.
3. We can perform the following operation any number of times: choose a red cube and a blue cube that are adjacent, and remove them. Here, the cubes that were stacked on the removed cubes will fall down onto the object below them.
4. At most how many cubes can be removed?

Let's analyze the problem. We can remove at most N/2 cubes.

Let's consider the following example:

S = 0011

We can remove the second and third cubes from the bottom. Then, the fourth cube drops onto the first cube.

We can remove the first and second cubes from the bottom.

In this example, we removed 4 cubes.

So, the maximum number of cubes that can be removed is N/2.

Now, let's consider a more efficient approach. We can use a greedy approach, where we remove the cubes that are closest to each other in the stack.

Let's consider the following example:

S = 0011

We can remove the first and second cubes from the bottom. Then, the third cube

3. How many of the ID cards allow us to pass all the gates alone?

Let's consider the first gate. If we have an ID card that allows us to pass the first gate, then we can pass all the gates alone.

Let's consider the second gate. If we have an ID card that allows us to pass the second gate, then we can pass all the gates alone.

Let's consider the third gate. If we have an ID card that allows us to pass the third gate, then we can pass all the gates alone.

1. The bus has a capacity of $w$ passengers.
2. The bus stops are numbered from $1$ to $n$ in chronological order.
3. The system records the number $y-x$, where $x$ is the number of passengers in the bus just before the current bus stop and $y$ is the number of passengers in the bus just after the current bus stop.
4. The test run was made for a single bus and $n$ bus stops.
5. The system recorded the sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, where $a_i$ is the record for the bus stop $i$.

Now, let's think about the problem.

We need to find the number of possible ways how many people could be in the bus before the first bus stop, if the bus has a capacity equals to $w$.

We can start with the base case, where the bus is empty. In this case, the number of possible ways is $1$, because there is only one way to have $0$ passengers in the bus.

Now, let's consider the case where the bus has $1$ passenger. In this case, the number of possible ways is $1$, because there is only one way to have $1$ passenger in the bus.

Now, let's consider the case where the bus has $2$ passengers. In this case, the number of possible ways is $2

1. Takahashi has A cookies, and Aoki has B cookies.
2. Takahashi will do the following action K times:

1. We are given an integer r.
2. We need to find the area of a circle of radius r.

The area of a circle of radius r is given by the formula:

Area = r^2

So, we can calculate the area of the circle of radius r as:

Area = r^2

3. We need to find the area of a circle of radius 1.

The area of a circle of radius 1 is given by the formula:

Area = π

So, we can calculate the area of the circle of radius 1 as:

Area = π

4. We need to divide the area of the circle of radius r by the area of the circle of radius 1.

So, we can calculate the result of the division as:

Result = r^2 / π

5. We need to print the result.

So, we can print the result as:

This approach is more straightforward and easier to understand, and it avoids the use of π, which can be a source of error.

1. We know that the number of guests is either A or B.
2. We also know that the number of snack pieces is the same for both cases.
3. We want to find the minimum number of pieces that can be evenly distributed to the guests in both cases.

Let's call the minimum number of pieces that can be evenly distributed to the guests in both cases x.

If we have A guests, each guest can take x pieces.
If we have B guests, each guest can take x pieces.

We know that the number of snack pieces is the same for both cases, so we can say that A x = B x.

We also know that x is an integer, so we can divide both sides of the equation by x to get:

A = B

So, the number of guests is the same for both cases.

If A and B are equal, then the minimum number of pieces that can be evenly distributed to the guests is 1.

If A and B are not equal, then the minimum number of pieces that can be evenly distributed to the guests is x.

Therefore, the output should be x if A and B are not equal, and 1 if A and B are equal.

- Do nothing.

The problem is to determine if it is possible to perform the operations so that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right.

N = 5
H_1 = 1
H_2 = 2
H_3 = 1

We can perform the following operations:

- Decrease the height of the second square by 1.

Now, the heights of the squares are:

H_1 = 1
H_2 = 1
H_3 = 1
H_4 = 1
H_5 = 3

The heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right.

Therefore, the answer is Yes.

Now, let's consider the second code. Since A_i1 B_1 + A_i2 B_2 +... + A_iM B_M

One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider using a more efficient data structure to store the input data, such as a 2D array or a hash table, rather than using a 1D array. This can help reduce the time complexity of your algorithm, especially if the input data is large. Additionally, you can

1. We will buy a product for N yen (the currency of Japan) at a shop.

We will use N yen to pay for the product.

2. If we use only 1000-yen bills to pay the price, how much change will we receive?

We will use two 1000-yen bills to pay the price.

3. Assume we use the minimum number of bills required.

We will use the minimum number of bills required to pay the price.

Let's calculate the change.

Change = N - (2 x 1000)
Change = N - 2000
Change = 1000

The amount of change is 1000 yen.

Therefore, we will receive 1000 yen in change.

Now, let's consider a more efficient approach to solve the problem.

We can use a modulo operation to calculate the change.

Change = N % 2000
Change = 1900 % 2000
Change = 1000

The amount of change is 1000 yen.

Therefore, we will receive 1000 yen in change.

In this new approach, we use a modulo operation to calculate the change instead of using a more complex calculation. This approach is more efficient

3. If there exists an integer Z that satisfies all of the following three conditions, they will come to an agreement, but otherwise war will break out.
 - X < Z \leq Y
 - x_1, x_2,..., x_N < Z
 - y_1, y_2,..., y_M \geq Z

Let's consider the first condition.

If X < Z \leq Y, then Z must be greater than X and less than or equal to Y.

Let's consider the second condition.

If x_1, x_2,..., x_N < Z, then Z must be greater than all of the x_i.

Let's consider the third condition.

If y_1, y_2,..., y_M \geq Z, then Z must be less than or equal to all of the y_i.

3. Initially, the hand of every clock stands still, pointing directly upward.
4. Dolphin starts all the clocks simultaneously.
5. In how many seconds will the hand of every clock point directly upward again?

Let's call the time when the hand of every clock points directly upward again as "t".

We know that the time when the hand of the i-th clock points directly upward again is T_i.

We also know that the time when the hand of the j-th clock points directly upward again is T_j.

We want to find the minimum value of t.

Let's consider the case where the hands of all clocks point directly upward at the same time.

If the hands of all clocks point directly upward at the same time, then the time when the hands of all clocks point directly upward again is the least common multiple (LCM) of T_1, T_2,..., T_N.

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers. For example, the LCM of 2 and 3 is 6, because 6 is a multiple of both 2 and 3.

4. Let S_1 be the sum of the masses of the weights in the former group, and S_2 be the sum of the masses of the weights in the latter group.
5. Consider all possible such divisions and find the minimum possible absolute difference of S_1 and S_2.

Now, let's think about the problem.

1. We need to find the minimum possible absolute difference of S_1 and S_2.
2. We can find the sum of the masses of the weights in the former group by adding up the masses of the weights with indices not greater than T.
3. We can find the sum of the masses of the weights in the latter group by adding up the masses of the weights with indices greater than T.

2. In one move, we can choose any element of the matrix and change its value to any integer between $1$ and $n \cdot m$, inclusive.
3. We can also take any column and shift it one cell up cyclically.
4. The goal is to obtain the matrix, where $a_{1, 1} = 1, a_{1, 2} = 2, \dots, a_{1, m} = m, a_{2, 1} = m + 1, a_{2, 2} = m + 2, \dots, a_{n, m} = n \cdot m$ (i.e. $a_{i, j} = (i - 1) \cdot m + j$) with the minimum number of moves performed.

4. Two students can form a team only if their skills are equal.
5. Students can solve problems to increase their skill.
6. One solved problem increases the skill by one.

Now, let's think about the problem.

We need to find the minimum total number of problems students should solve to form exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ teams.

We can start by solving problems for each team separately.

Let's say we have 6 students.

We need to form 3 teams.

We can solve 3 problems for the first team to form a team with the second student.

We can solve 2 problems for the second team to form a team with the third student.

We can solve 1 problem for the third team to form a team with the fourth student.

We can solve 2 problems for the fourth team to form a team with the fifth student.

We can solve 1 problem for the fifth team to form a team with the sixth student.

The total number of problems solved is 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8.

Therefore, the minimum total number of problems students should solve to form exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ teams is 8.

3. We also know that $a_i=0$ if the $i$-th hour in a day is working and $a_i=1$ if the $i$-th hour is resting.
4. We also know that it is guaranteed that $a_i=0$ for at least one $i$.
5. We need to find the maximal number of continuous hours during which Polycarp rests.

Let's start with the first example.

The first example has $n=5$ hours. The schedule is $1 0 1 0 1$.

We can see that the maximal rest starts in the last hour and goes to the first hour of the next day. Therefore, the answer is $2$.

Let's move on to the second example.

The second example has $n=6$ hours. The schedule is $0 1 0 1 1 0$.

We can see that Polycarp has two rest periods, from the $4$-th to the $5$-th hour and from the $5$-th to the $6$-th hour. Therefore, the answer is

First, we need to understand the problem. We are given two arrays $a$ and $b$, both of length $n$. All elements of both arrays are from $0$ to $n-1$.

We can reorder elements of the array $b$ (if we want, we may leave the order of elements as it is). After that, let array $c$ be the array of length $n$, the $i$-th element of this array is $c_i = (a_i + b_i) \% n$, where $x \% y$ is $x$ modulo $y$.

Our task is to reorder elements of the array $b$ to obtain the lexicographically minimum possible array $c$.

Array $x$ of length $n$ is lexicographically less than array $y$ of length $n$, if there exists such $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$), that $x_i < y_i$, and for any $j$ ($1 \le j < i$) $x_j = y_j$.

Now, let's think about the solution. We can use a hash table to keep track of the elements in $b$ and their corresponding indices. This will allow us to quickly check if an element is already in $b$ and to find the index of an element in $b$.

We can also use a priority queue to keep track of the elements in $c$ and

The input consists of four lines, each line containing a single digit 0 or 1.

The output is a single digit, 0 or 1.

The problem is to find the majority element in the input.

The majority element is an element that appears more than half of the total number of elements in the input.

Let's count the number of 0s and 1s in the input.

The first line contains 0, so there is one 0.

The second line contains 1, so there is one 1.

The third line contains 1, so there is one 1.

The fourth line contains 0, so there is one 0.

In total, there are 4 lines, and each line contains a single digit 0 or 1.

So, the total number of elements in the input is 4.

Now, let's count the number of 0s and 1s in the input.

The number of 0s is 1, and the number of 1s is 3.

Since the number of 0s is less than half of the total number of elements in the input, the majority element is 1.

Therefore, the output is 1.

3. Takahashi will arrive at the place in time if he travels for a distance of D meters.
4. Takahashi will arrive at the place in time if he travels for a time of T minutes.

Let's calculate the time it takes for Takahashi to travel for a distance of D meters at a speed of S meters per minute.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = D / S

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Takahashi to travel for a time of T minutes at a speed of S meters per minute.

Time = Time x Speed
Time = T x S

Now, let's find the minimum value of the two expressions.

The smallest number that can be divisible by 100 exactly 0 times is 1.

Now, let's move on to the next number that can be divisible by 100 exactly 1 time.

The next number that can be divisible by 100 exactly 1 time is 100.

Now, let's move on to the next number that can be divisible by 100 exactly 2 times.

The next number that can be divisible by 100 exactly 2 times is 200.

3. Find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of the N integers on the blackboard after our move.

Let's consider the following example:

N = 3

We choose A_1 and replace it with 4.

N = 3
A_1 = 4
A_2 = 6
A_3 = 8

The greatest common divisor of the three integers on the blackboard is 2, which is the maximum possible value.

Now, let's think about the problem.

We need to reconstruct the order in which the students entered the classroom.

We can start by finding the student number of the first student who entered the classroom.

We can do this by finding the student number of the student with the smallest A_i value.

Once we have found the student number of the first student, we can add it to the list of students in the order they entered the classroom.

We can then find the student number of the next student who entered the classroom by finding the student number of the student with the smallest A_i value that is greater than the student number of the first student.

We can continue this process until we have added all the student numbers to the list.

Finally, we can print the list of student numbers in the order they entered the classroom.

One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a priority queue to keep track of the students in the classroom, where the priority of each student is determined by its A_i value. This will allow you to efficiently find the next student who entered the classroom,

Let's start by finding the largest integer that Takahashi can buy when he has X yen.

We know that the integer N is sold for A \times N + B \times d(N) yen.

Let's assume that the largest integer that Takahashi can buy is N.

We can calculate the price of N as follows:

A \times N + B \times d(N) = A \times N + B \times (log10(N))

We know that log10(N) is an integer, so we can round it down to the nearest integer.

A \times N + B \times (log10(N)) = A \times N + B \times (log10(N) - 1)

We can simplify this equation by

A \times N + B \times (log10(N) - 1) = A \times N + B \times (log10(N) - 1)

We can see that the largest integer that Takahashi can buy is N, and the price of N

1. The initial character of S is an uppercase A.

We can check this by using the index of the first character of S. If the first character is not an uppercase A, then we can print WA.

2. There is exactly one occurrence of C between the third character from the beginning and the second to last character (inclusive).

We can check this by using the index of the third character from the beginning and the second to last character. If there is no C between these two indices, then we can print WA.

3. All letters except the A and C mentioned above are lowercase.

We can check this by using a for loop to iterate through the characters of S. If any character is not lowercase, then we can print WA.

So, the solution is:

if S[0]!= 'A' or S.count('C')!= 1 or any(c.isupper() for c in S if c not in ['A', 'C']):

Let's start by finding the length of the string after 5 \times 10^{15} days.

The length of the string after 5 \times 10^{15} days is equal to the number of days that have passed since the string was created.

The number of days that have passed since the string was created is 5 \times 10^{15}.

The number of characters in a day is 10.

So, the length of the string after 5 \times 10^{15} days is equal to:

1. We have a sequence p = {p_1, p_2,..., p_N} which is a permutation of {1, 2,..., N}.
2. We can perform the following operation at most once: choose integers i and j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ N), and swap p_i and p_j. Note that we can also choose not to perform it.
3. Print YES if we can sort p in ascending order in this way, and NO otherwise.

Now, let's think about the problem. We need to find a way to sort the sequence p in ascending order. We can do this by swapping the elements of the sequence in the right order.

Let's consider the case where we choose to perform the operation. We can swap the elements of the sequence in the following way:

1. Swap p_1 and p_2.
2. Swap p_3 and p_4.
3. Swap p_5 and p_6.
4....
5. Swap p_N-1 and p_N.

Now, we have sorted the sequence p in ascending order.

Now, let's consider the case where we choose not to perform the operation. In this case, we can still sort the sequence p in ascending order by simply iterating through the sequence and swapping adjacent elements that are in the wrong order. This approach has a time complexity of O(N^

1. Polycarp wants to cut from it the maximum number of numbers that are divisible by 3.
2. To do this, he makes an arbitrary number of vertical cuts between pairs of adjacent digits.
3. As a result, after m such cuts, there will be m+1 parts in total.
4. Polycarp analyzes each of the obtained numbers and finds the number of those that are divisible by 3.
5. For example, if the original number is s=3121, then Polycarp can cut it into three parts with two cuts: 3|1|21. As a result, he will get two numbers that are divisible by 3.
6. Polycarp can make an arbitrary number of vertical cuts, where each cut is made between a pair of adjacent digits.
7. The resulting numbers cannot contain extra leading zeroes (that is, the number can begin with 0 if and only if this number is exactly one character '0').
8. For example, 007, 01 and 00099 are not valid numbers, but 90, 0 and 10

Now, let's update your approach to include the new information:

1. We need to find the largest number of zeroes in the array $c$.
2. We need to find the optimal value of $d$ to maximize the number of zeroes in $c$.

Let's start with the second point. We need to find the optimal value of $d$ to maximize the number of zeroes in $c$.

Let's consider the following example:

$a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$
$b = [2, 4, 7, 11, 3]$

We can create the array $c$ as follows:

$c = [2, 8, 15, 22, 10]$

The number of zeroes in $c$ is 2.

We can see that the optimal value of $d$ is $d = 2$.

Let's consider another example:

$a = [13, 37, 39]$
$b = [1, 2, 3]$

We can create the array $c$ as follows:

$c = [26, 70, 72]$

The number of zeroes in $c$ is 1.

We can see that the optimal value of $d$ is $d = -\frac{1}{13}$.

3. We can then find the next block by finding the next element in the array that has the same sum as the previous block.
4. We can continue this process until we have found all the blocks.

Let's call the sum of the elements in each block $s$. We can use a hash table to keep track of the sums of the elements in the array. We can use the hash table to find the next element in the array that has the same sum as the previous block.

Let's call the indices of the blocks $l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, \ldots, l_k, r_k$. We can use a hash table to keep track of the indices of the blocks. We can use the hash table to find the next index in the array that has the same sum as the previous block.

1. First, we need to find the number of pairs of positions $(i, j)$ ($i \neq j$) in array $a$ such that the concatenation of $a_i$ and $a_j$ is divisible by $k$.
2. We can use a set to store the concatenation of $a_i$ and $a_j$ for each pair of positions $(i, j)$ ($i \neq j$). This will allow us to check if a concatenation is already in the set in constant time, which can help reduce the time complexity of our algorithm.
3. We can use a loop to iterate through all pairs of positions $(i, j)$ ($i \neq j$) in array $a$.
4. For each pair of positions $(i, j)$, we can check if the concatenation of $a_i$ and $a_j$ is divisible by $k$. If it is, we can add the pair to the set.
5. After iterating through all pairs of positions $(i, j)$ ($i \neq j$), we can print the number of pairs in the set.

Here is the updated code:

2. We also know that B_i ≥ max(A_i, A_{i+1}) for all i.
3. We want to find the maximum possible sum of the elements of A.

Let's start by considering the first element of A, A_1. We know that B_1 ≥ max(A_1, A_2), so we can assume that B_1 ≥ A_1.

Now, let's consider the second element of A, A_2. We know that B_2 ≥ max(A_2, A_3), so we can assume that B_2 ≥ A_2.

We can continue this process for each element of A, considering the element at the current position and the element at the next position. We can assume that the current element is greater than or equal to the next element, because we know that B_i ≥ max(A_i, A_{i+1}) for all i.

Finally, we can consider the last element of A, A_N. We know that B_N ≥ max(A_N, A_N-1), so we can assume that B_N ≥ A_N.

3. We are also given Q quadruples of integers (a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i).
4. We need to find the maximum possible score of A.
5. The score is the sum of d_i over all indices i such that A_{b_i} - A_{a_i} = c_i.

Now, let's think about how we can solve this problem.

1. We can start by sorting the quadruples in non-decreasing order of b_i.
2. We can then iterate through the quadruples and check if the current sequence A satisfies the conditions.
3. If the current sequence A satisfies the conditions, we can calculate the score and update the maximum score.
4. If the current sequence A does not satisfy the conditions, we can move on to the next sequence.

4. We can then use a priority queue to keep track of the maximum absolute difference.
5. We can initialize the priority queue with the first element of A and its corresponding index.
6. We can then iterate through the rest of the elements of A and compare each element with the elements in the hash table.
7. If we find a larger absolute difference, we can update the priority queue with the new maximum absolute difference.
8. We can then print the maximum absolute difference we found.

Let's break down the code:

distance = sqrt((x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2)

2. Next, we need to calculate the length of each path. We can do this by summing up the distances between each pair of towns in the path.

length = sum of distances between each pair of towns

3. Finally, we need to calculate the average length of all the paths. We can do this by dividing the total length of all the paths by the number of paths.

average length = total length / number of paths

By using the Euclidean distance formula and summing up the distances between each pair of towns in the path, we can calculate the length of each path more efficiently and accurately. By dividing the total length of all the paths by the number of paths, we can calculate the average length of all the paths.

2. The uncovered part has a horizontal length of 4.
3. We need to find the total horizontal length of the uncovered parts of the window.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum horizontal length of the uncovered part of the window.

Let's consider three cases:

Case 1: The curtains are hung on the sides of the window.

In this case, the uncovered part of the window has a horizontal length of 4.

Case 2: The curtains are hung on the top and bottom of the window.

In this case, the uncovered part of the window has a horizontal length of 8.

Case 3: The curtains are hung on the sides and top of the window.

In this case, the uncovered part of the window has a horizontal length of 12.

So, the total horizontal length of the uncovered parts of the window is 4 + 8 + 12 = 24.

Therefore, the output is 24.

Now, let's solve this problem.

2. We also know that the probability of choosing an even number is 1/2.
3. Therefore, the probability of choosing an odd number is 1/2.

So, the answer is 1/2.

But wait, there's more! Here's a hint:

The probability of choosing an odd number is not just 1/2, but rather 1/2 for each odd number up to N.

So, the probability of choosing an odd number is 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 +... + 1/2^N, which is approximately 0.5000000000.

4. If y_{ij} = 1, the testimony says Person x_{ij} is honest; if y_{ij} = 0, it says Person x_{ij} is unkind.

The problem asks us to find the maximum possible number of honest persons among the N people.

Let's start by considering the case where all the testimonies are consistent. In this case, we can easily find the maximum number of honest persons by counting the number of testimonies that say a person is honest.

However, we need to consider the case where the testimonies are not consistent. In this case, we need to find the maximum number of honest persons among the N people while considering the inconsistencies in the testimonies.

To do this, we can use a technique called "inconsistency resolution." This involves considering each person's testimonies and determining whether they are consistent with each other. If a person's testimonies are consistent, we can add them to the list of honest persons. If a person's testimonies are not consistent, we can remove them from the list of honest persons.

So, we need to find the number of snakes who have no snacks.

Let's start by finding the number of snakes who have at least one snack.

We can do this by finding the number of snakes who have no snacks and subtracting the number of snakes who have no snacks.

Let's call the number of snakes who have no snacks "x".

So, we can find x by finding the sum of the elements in the array A.

We know that y = sum(A).

So, we can find y by summing up all the elements in the array A.

The maximum possible sum of the numbers written on the cards chosen is the maximum value of the numbers written on the cards.

The maximum value of the numbers written on the cards is the maximum value of the numbers written on the A cards, the maximum value of the numbers written on the B cards, and the maximum value of the numbers written on the C cards.

The maximum value of the numbers written on the A cards is 1.
The maximum value of the numbers written on the B cards is 0.
The maximum value of the numbers written on the C cards is -1.

The maximum possible sum of the numbers written on the cards chosen is the maximum of the maximum value of the numbers written on the A cards, the maximum value of the numbers written on the B cards, and the maximum value of the numbers written on the C cards.

To find the maximum possible sum, we can use a single loop to iterate through the cards and find the maximum value. This approach will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from O(A + B + C) to O(1), which can make a significant difference for large values of A, B, and C.

2. We also know that each crane has two legs, and each turtle has four legs.
3. We need to find a combination of numbers of cranes and turtles in which the statement is correct.

Let's start with the number of cranes. We know that there are X animals in total, and each crane has two legs. So, we can calculate the total number of legs of cranes as follows:

2 \* X

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs of turtles:

4 \* (X - 1)

If we add the total number of legs of cranes and turtles, we get:

2 \* X + 4 \* (X - 1)

We are given that this sum is equal to Y. So, we can write an equation:

2 \* X + 4 \* (X - 1) = Y

We can simplify this equation by combining the like terms:

2 \* X + 4 \* X - 4 = Y

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:

2 \* X - 4 = Y - 4

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

So, the number of paths that start from vertex 1 is:

Among the integers not contained in the sequence p_1,..., p_N (not necessarily positive), the one nearest to 6 is 8.

So, the solution is to find the integer whose absolute difference with X is the minimum. We can use a hash table or a binary search tree to efficiently store and search for the integers not contained in the sequence p_1,..., p_N. We can also use a technique called "two-pointer" to find the nearest integer in O(log N) time complexity, which is much faster than the O(N) time complexity of a linear search.

1. We have H rows and W columns of white square cells.
2. We will choose h of the rows and w of the columns, and paint all of the cells contained in those rows or columns.
3. How many white cells will remain?

We can prove that this count does not depend on what rows and columns are chosen.

Let's consider the following example:

H = 3, W = 2, h = 2, w = 1

The initial state of the grid is:

1 1
1 1
1 1

We will paint the first two rows and the first column in black.

1 1
0 1
0 1

Now, we have 1 white cell remaining.

We can see that the number of white cells remaining is always 1, regardless of the rows and columns we choose to paint.

So, the output will be 1.

First, we need to check if the string is good or not. If the string is good, we don't need to delete any characters. If the string is not good, we need to delete some characters to make it good.

Let's consider a string s of length n. We can check if the string is good by checking the following conditions:

1. The length of the string is even.
2. Every character in odd position of this string is different from the next character (the first character is different from the second, the third is different from the fourth, and so on).

If the string is good, we don't need to delete any characters. If the string is not good, we need to delete some characters to make it good.

Let's consider a string s of length n. We can delete some characters from the string to make it good. We can delete characters from the string in the following way:

First, we need to understand the problem. We are given a connected undirected graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. There are no self-loops or multiple edges in the given graph.

We need to direct its edges in such a way that the obtained directed graph does not contain any paths of length two or greater (where the length of path is denoted as the number of traversed edges).

The input consists of two integer numbers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $n - 1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of vertices and edges, respectively.

The following $m$ lines contain edges: edge $i$ is given as a pair of vertices $u_i$, $v_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $u_i \ne v_i$). There are no multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair ($u_i, v_i$) there are no other pairs ($u_i, v_i$) and ($v_i, u_i$) in the list of edges. It is also guaranteed that the given graph is connected (there is a path between any pair of vertex in the given graph).

2. Next, we need to find all the points that don't belong to any segment. We can do this by checking if the point is not between the left and right endpoints of any segment.
3. Finally, we need to print all the points that don't belong to any segment.

Let's start with step 1. We need to find all the points that belong to a segment. We can do this by checking if the point is between the left and right endpoints of each segment.

Let's consider the first segment. The left endpoint is $l_1 = 2$ and the right endpoint is $r_1 = 2$. Therefore, the point $2$ belongs to the first segment.

Let's consider the second segment. The left endpoint is $l_2 = 1$ and the right endpoint is $r_2 = 2$. Therefore, the point $1$ and the point $2$ both belong to the second segment.

Let's consider the third segment. The left endpoint is $l_3 = 5$ and the right endpoint is $r_3 = 5$. Therefore, the point $5$ belongs to the third segment.

Now, let's find all the points that don't belong to any segment.

2. We can start by finding the number of integers between A and B (inclusive) that can be evenly divided by C.
3. We can find the number of integers between A and B (inclusive) that can be evenly divided by D by subtracting the number of integers between A and B (inclusive) that can be evenly divided by C from the total number of integers between A and B (inclusive).
4. We can find the number of integers between A and B (inclusive) that can be evenly divided by neither C nor D by subtracting the number of integers between A and B (inclusive) that can be evenly divided by both C and D from the total number of integers between A and B (inclusive).

1. We are given an integer N.
2. We need to determine whether N is a multiple of 9.
3. To do this, we need to find out whether the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of N is a multiple of 9.
4. We can use the modulo operator to calculate the sum directly. For example, if N = 123456789, we can calculate the sum of the digits as follows:

sum = (N % 10) + (N % 100) / 10 + (N % 1000) / 100 + (N % 1 0000) / 1000 + (N % 10000) / 10000

This expression calculates the sum of the digits of N using the modulo operator. If the sum is a multiple of 9, then N is a multiple of 9. If the sum is not a multiple of 9, then N is not a multiple of 9.

So, the new solution is to use the modulo operator to calculate the sum of the digits of N and check if the result is a multiple of 9. If it is, then N is a multiple of 9. If it's not, then N is not a multiple of 9.

Let's use the third approach, comparing the two strings character by character using a sliding window.

Let's start with the first step. We need to find the number of elements p_i (1 < i < n) that satisfy the condition.

We can use a for loop to iterate through all the elements of the permutation.

for i in range(1, n):

In this loop, we are checking if the current element is the second smallest number among the three numbers p[i - 1], p[i], and p[i + 1]. If it is, we increment the count by 1.

Now, let's move on to the second step. We need to find the second smallest number among p_i - 1, p_i, and p_i + 1.

Let's call the center of the circle (x_c, y_c) and the radius r. We can find the angle of the circle by using the formula:

We can also find the radius by using the formula:

where (x_1, y_1) is any point on the circle.

1. We know that the area of a right triangle is half the product of the lengths of the sides.
2. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the sides is equal to the length of the hypotenuse.
3. We can use these two facts to find the area of the triangle.

Let's start by finding the sum of the lengths of the sides. We know that the length of the hypotenuse is |CA|, and the lengths of the other two sides are |AB| and |BC|. So, the sum of the lengths of the sides is:

|AB| + |BC| + |CA| = |AB| + |BC| + |CA|

Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the sides is equal to the length of the hypotenuse to find the area of the triangle. We know that the area of the triangle is half the product of the lengths of the sides, so we can write:

Area = (|AB| + |BC| + |CA|) / 2

Now, we can substitute the expression for the sum of the lengths of the sides into the formula for the area of the triangle. We get:

Area = (|AB| + |BC| + |CA|) / 2

Now, we can simplify the expression by multiplying both sides by 2. We get:

Area = |AB| + |BC| + |CA|

3. Takahashi likes the sound when he buys a drink from a vending machine.

1. First, we need to read the input from the standard input.
2. Then, we need to compute the product of A and B.
3. Finally, we need to print the result as an integer.

Let's describe the solution in words:

1. Read the input from the standard input.
2. Compute the product of A and B.
3. Print the result as an integer.

In code, we can write the solution as follows:

```
# Read the input from the standard input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Compute the product of A and B
result = a * b

# Print the result as an integer
print(result)
```
In this code, we first read the input from the standard input using the `input()` function. We then use the `map()` function to convert the input strings to integers directly, rather than using the `split()` function and then the `int()` function.

We then compute the product of `a` and `b` using the `*` operator. Finally, we print the result as an integer using the `print()` function.

1. Taro has to study for T hours in World B.
2. In World B, time passes X times as fast as it does in our world (World A).
3. We need to find out how many hours will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B.

Let's call the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B as H.

We know that H = T \* X.

We also know that in World B, time passes X times as fast as it does in our world (World A).

So, if X hours pass in World B, X/X = 1 hour passes in World A.

Therefore, we can say that H = T \* X = T.

So, the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B is T.

3. Bottle 2 contains C milliliters of water.
4. We will transfer water from Bottle 2 to Bottle 1 as much as possible.
5. How much amount of water will remain in Bottle 2?

Let's start by transferring water from Bottle 2 to Bottle 1. We can transfer up to A - B milliliters of water from Bottle 2 to Bottle 1.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water that will remain in Bottle 2.

If B > A, then we cannot transfer all the water from Bottle 2 to Bottle 1, and the amount of water that will remain in Bottle 2 will be C - B milliliters.

If B <= A, then we can transfer all the water from Bottle 2 to Bottle 1, and the amount of water that will remain in Bottle 2 will be 0 milliliters.

Therefore, the output is C - B if B > A, and 0 if B <= A.

1. We have two permutations P and Q of size N.
2. There are N! possible permutations of size N.
3. Among them, let P and Q be the a-th and b-th lexicographically smallest permutations, respectively.
4. Find |a - b|.

We need to find the difference between the positions of P and Q in the original permutation.

Let's consider the example of N = 3.

The possible permutations of size 3 are:

(1,~2,~3), (1,~3,~2), (2,~1,~3), (2,~3,~1), (3,~1,~2), and (3,~2,~1).

Among them, (1,~3,~2) and (3,~1,~2) come 2-nd and 5-th in lexicographical order, so the answer is |2 - 5| = 3.

Therefore, the solution is to find the difference between the positions of P and Q in the original permutation.

To do this, we can use the fact that the original permutation is already sorted. So, we can find the index of P and Q in the original permutation and then find the difference between them. This approach will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from O(N!) to O(N) since the original

3. If the current character is an ACGT character
4. Push the current character onto a stack.
5. If the current character is not an ACGT character
6. Pop the top character from the stack.
7. If the stack is empty, continue to the next character.
8. If the stack is not empty, check if the current ACGT string is a substring of S.
9. If the current ACGT string is a substring of S, update the longest ACGT string that is a substring of S.
10. Repeat steps 2 to 9 until you have checked all the characters in S.
11. Finally, print the length of the longest ACGT string that is a substring of S.

This approach uses a stack to keep track of the ACGT characters in the current ACGT string. It also uses a flag to check if the current ACGT string is a substring of S. This approach is more efficient than the previous one because it avoids the need to check every character in S for ACGT characters, and it only checks the ACGT characters that are actually part of the current ACGT string.

3. Among them, some K consecutive stones are painted black, and the others are painted white.
4. Additionally, we know that the stone at coordinate X is painted black.

Now, let's think about the problem.

We need to find all coordinates that potentially contain a stone painted black, in ascending order.

Let's start with the first case.

The three stones painted black are placed at coordinates 5, 6, and 7.

We know that the stone at coordinate 7 is painted black.

So, we need to find all coordinates between 5 and 7 that potentially contain a stone painted black.

The coordinates between 5 and 7 are 5, 6, and 7.

Therefore, the output is 5 6 7.

Now, let's move on to the second case.

The three stones painted black are placed at coordinates 6, 7, and 8.

We know that the stone at coordinate 7 is painted black.

So, we need to find all coordinates between 6 and 8 that

1. If the temperature of the room is 30 degrees Celsius or above, we will turn on the air conditioner.
2. If the temperature of the room is less than 30 degrees Celsius, we will not turn on the air conditioner.

Now, let's analyze the given input.

The current temperature of the room is X degrees Celsius.

We know that -40 ≤ X ≤ 40.

So, we can conclude that X is an integer.

Now, let's think about the problem.

If X is greater than or equal to 30, we will turn on the air conditioner.

If X is less than 30, we will not turn on the air conditioner.

So, we need to print "Yes" if X is greater than or equal to 30.

If X is less than 30, we will not turn on the air conditioner, so we print "No".

So, the final answer is:

If X is greater than or equal to 30, print "Yes".

If X is less than 30, print "No".

1. We have N points in a D-dimensional space.

3. The distance between two points with coordinates (y_1, y_2,..., y_D) and (z_1, z_2,..., z_D) is \sqrt{(y_1 - z_1)^2 + (y_2 - z_2)^2 +... + (y_D - z_D)^2}.
4. How many pairs (i, j) (i < j) are there such that the distance between the i-th point and the j-th point is an integer?

Let's consider the distance between the i-th point and the j-th point as d.

d = \sqrt{(X_{ij1} - X_{jk1})^2 + (X_{ij2} - X_{jk2})^2 +... + (X_{ijD} - X_{jkD})^2}.

We can simplify this expression by noticing that the distance between two points in a D-dimensional space is always an integer. Therefore, we can set d = k, where k is an integer.

Now, we need to find the number of pairs (i, j) (i < j) such that the distance between the i-th point and the j-th point is equal to k.

1. We need to check if the security code is hard to enter.
2. We need to check if the security code contains two consecutive digits that are the same.
3. If the security code contains two consecutive digits that are the same, we need to print Bad.
4. If the security code does not contain two consecutive digits that are the same, we need to print Good.

Let's start with the first step. We need to check if the security code is hard to enter. We can use a for loop to iterate through the digits of the security code.

Let's assume the security code is 3776. We can use a for loop to iterate through the digits of the security code.

for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    if (S[i] == S[i + 1]) {
        // The security code is hard to enter
        break;
    }
}

If the security code contains two consecutive digits that are the same, we can break out of the loop and print Bad.

If the security code does not contain two consecutive digits that are the same, we can print Good.

Here is the updated code:

3. We can then use a loop to find the position of the next occurrence of the substring "ABC" in the string "S".
4. We can use the "substring" function to extract the substring from the position of the first occurrence to the position of the next occurrence.

2. The problem has N test cases, all of which must be passed to get an AC verdict.
3. Takahashi's submission has passed M cases out of the N test cases.

Now, we need to determine whether Takahashi's submission gets an AC.

If M is equal to N, then Takahashi's submission gets an AC. This is because all test cases have been passed, and he has passed all the test cases.

If M is less than N, then Takahashi's submission does not get an AC. This is because he has passed some test cases but not all of them.

If M is greater than N, then Takahashi's submission does not get an AC. This is because he has not passed all the test cases.

If M is equal to 0, then Takahashi's submission does not get an AC. This is because he has not passed any test cases.

Therefore, we can say that Takahashi's submission gets an AC if M is equal to N. Otherwise, it does not get an AC.

We need to check if the above conditions are met.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. Check if the 3-rd and 4-th characters of S are equal.
2. Check if the 5-th and 6-th characters of S are also equal.

We can use a hash table to store the characters and their corresponding indices. This will allow us to check if the 3-rd and 4-th characters of S are equal in O(1) time, and if the 5-th and 6-th characters of S are also equal in O(1) time.

Let's start by sorting the routes by their costs in ascending order.

1. We sort the routes by their costs in ascending order.
2. We check each route one by one.
3. If the cost of the current route is less than or equal to T, we print the cost of the current route.
4. If the cost of the current route is greater than T, we move on to the next route.

If we reach the end of the routes without finding a route that takes not longer than time T, we print TLE instead.

So, the solution is to sort the routes by their costs in ascending order, check each route one by one, and print the cost of the first route that takes not longer than time T. If there is no such route, we print TLE instead.

I hope this updated approach is helpful! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

First, we need to understand the problem. We have $n$ cities and $n-1$ roads. Each road is bidirectional and connects two distinct cities. From any city, we can get to any other city by roads. The country's topology is an undirected tree.

The government is afraid to look unfair. They think that people in a city can consider them unfair if there is one company which owns two or more roads entering the city. The government wants to make such privatization that the number of such cities doesn't exceed $k$ and the number of companies taking part in the privatization is minimal.

The first thing we need to do is to find the number of companies $r$ such that it is possible to assign each road to one company in such a way that the number of cities that have two or more roads of one company is at most $k$.

First, we need to understand the problem. We have $n$ friends, each of whom lives in a house with an integer coordinate $x_i$. Each friend can move to the house with the coordinate $x_i-1$, $x_i+1$, or stay at $x_i$. The number of occupied houses is the number of distinct positions among the final ones.

The problem asks us to find the minimum and maximum number of occupied houses that can be obtained after all moves are performed.

Let's start with the minimum number of occupied houses. We can see that the minimum number of occupied houses is $1$. This is because each friend can only move to the house with the coordinate $x_i-1$, $x_i+1$, or stay at $x_i$. Therefore, each friend can only occupy one house.

Now, let's think about the maximum number of occupied houses. We can see that the maximum number of occupied houses is $n$. This is because each friend can move to the house with the coordinate $x_i-1$, $x_i+1$, or stay at $x_i$. Therefore, each friend can occupy one of the $n$ houses.

Therefore, the minimum and maximum number of occupied houses that can be obtained after all moves are performed are $1$ and $n$, respectively.

1. We know that the initial charge of Vova's laptop battery is $k$.
2. We also know that the number of turns in the game is $n$.
3. We know that the first type turn is when Vova plays and the charge of his laptop battery is strictly greater than $a$.
4. We know that the second type turn is when Vova plays and charges his laptop battery and the charge of his laptop battery is strictly greater than $b$.
5. We know that the third type turn is when Vova cannot do anything and loses the game.

Now, we need to find the maximum number of turns Vova can just play (make the first type turn).

Let's consider the following cases:

Case 1: If the initial charge of Vova's laptop battery is greater than $a$, then Vova can just play and the charge of his laptop battery will decrease by $a$. So, the remaining charge of the battery will be $k - a$.

Case 2: If the initial charge of Vova's laptop battery is greater than $b$, then Vova can play and charge his laptop battery and the charge of his laptop battery will decrease by $b$. So, the remaining charge of the battery will be $k - b$.

Case 3: If the initial charge of Vova's laptop battery is less than or equal to $a$ and $b$ at the same time, then Vova cannot do anything and

1. First, we need to find all possible strings that can be formed by replacing all question marks with letters "a", "b" and "c".
2. Then, we need to find all possible substrings "abc" in all these strings.
3. Finally, we need to count the total number of substrings "abc" and print it modulo $10^{9} + 7$.

Let's start with the first step.

We can replace all question marks with letters "a", "b" and "c" in $3^k$ ways.

For example, if $s = $"ac?b?c", then we can replace the question marks with "a", "b" and "c" in the following ways:

* "acabac"
* "acabbc"
* "acabcc"
* "acbbac"
* "acbbbc"
* "acbbcc"
* "accbac"
* "accbbc"
* "accbcc"

So, we can obtain $3^k$ strings.

Now, let's move on to the second step.

We need to find all possible substrings "abc" in all these strings.

We can use a sliding window approach to find all possible substrings "abc" in each string.

For example, in the string "acabac", we can find the following substrings

1. Polycarp can move only from left to right.
2. There are n non-intersecting segments of rain.
3. There are m umbrellas lying on the line.
4. Polycarp can pick up and throw away umbrellas.
5. Polycarp must carry at least one umbrella while he moves from x to x+1 if a segment [x, x+1] is in the rain.
6. Each unit of length passed increases Polycarp's fatigue by the sum of the weights of umbrellas he carries while moving.

Let's denote the fatigue of Polycarp at a point x as F(x).

We can define F(x) as follows:

1. If x is not in any rain segment, F(x) = 0.
2. If x is in a rain segment [l_i, r_i], F(x) = ∑_{j=1}^m p_j if x ∈ [l_i, r_i].

Now, let's consider the minimum total fatigue after reaching x = a. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.

Let dp[i] be the minimum total fatigue after reaching x = i. We can initialize dp[0] = 0 and dp[1] = 0.

For i = 2 to a, we can calculate d

4. We can use a more straightforward approach by checking if the numbers are equal and if the other number is different from those two numbers.
5. We can use a single if statement with two conditions.
6. If the numbers are equal and the other number is different from those two numbers, then the triple is poor.
7. If the numbers are not equal or the other number is the same as one of the equal numbers, then the triple is not poor.

So, the solution is to use a single if statement with two conditions to check if the triple is poor. If the conditions are met, then print Yes; otherwise, print No.

1. We need to find the place with the closest average temperature to A degrees Celsius.
2. We need to find the index of the place with the closest average temperature to A degrees Celsius.

Let's define the distance between the average temperature of a place and A degrees Celsius as d(i).

d(i) = |T - (H_i \* 0.006) - A|

We need to find the index of the place with the smallest distance between the average temperature and A degrees Celsius.

Let's use a hash table to store the distance between the average temperature and A degrees Celsius for each place.

hash_table = {
    i: d(i)
    for i in range(N)
}

Now, we can find the index of the place with the smallest distance between the average temperature and A degrees Celsius in O(1) time.

index = min(hash_table, key=hash_table.get)

Finally, we can print the index of the place where the palace should be built.

3. The numbers written on M of the balls are odd.
4. Find the number of ways to choose two of the N+M balls (disregarding order) so that the sum of the numbers written on them is even.

Let's start with the first step. We have N+M balls, each of which has an integer written on it.

Let's consider all N+M balls equally. This will simplify the analysis and make it easier to reason about the number of ways to choose two balls.

Let's consider the parity of the sum of the numbers written on the first two balls. If the sum of the numbers written on the first two balls is even, then we have two even numbers, and if the sum of the numbers written on the first two balls is odd, then we have two odd numbers.

Let's consider the number of ways to choose two balls. We can choose two balls in N+M ways.

Let's consider the number of ways to choose two balls so that the sum of the numbers written on them is even. If we choose two balls, then the sum of the numbers written on them is even if and only if the numbers written on the two balls have the same parity.

6. The substring of S starting at index l_i and ending at index r_i is denoted as S[l_i:r_i].
7. We need to find the number of times the substring AC occurs in S[l_i:r_i].
8. We can use the following approach to solve this problem:

Step 1: Find the number of times the substring AC occurs in S[l_i:r_i].
Step 2: Find the number of times the substring AC occurs in S[l_i:r_i - 1].
Step 3: Find the number of times the substring AC occurs in S[l_i:

This approach uses a sliding window approach to find the number of times the substring AC occurs in the substring of S starting at index l_i and ending at index r_i. It involves maintaining a window of size 2 that slides over the substring S[l_i:r_i

1. We start at one of the airports.
2. We fly to another airport.
3. We fly to the other airport.

The minimum possible sum of the flight times is the minimum of the following sums:

1. A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C: 1 + 3 = 4 hours
2. A \rightarrow C \rightarrow C: 4 + 3 = 7 hours
3. B \rightarrow A \rightarrow C: 1 + 4 = 5 hours
4. B \rightarrow C \rightarrow A: 3 + 4 = 7 hours
5. C \rightarrow A \rightarrow B: 4 + 1 = 5 hours
6. C \rightarrow B \rightarrow A: 3 + 1 = 4 hours

The minimum of these is 4 hours.

Now, let's consider all possible routes. We can start at any of the three airports, and then fly to any of the other two airports. This gives us a total of 3 x 2 = 6 possible routes.

We can use a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum sum of flight times for each route. We can store the flight times for each route in a hash table, and then use the hash table to find the minimum sum of flight times for each route.

1. We know that X and A are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
2. We need to check if X is less than A.
3. If X is less than A, we should print 0.
4. If X is not less than A, we should print 10.

So, we need to write a program that checks if X is less than A and prints the appropriate value.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. Check if X is less than A.
2. Print 0 if X is less than A.
3. Print 10 if X is not less than A.

We can solve this problem using an if-else statement.

Here's the solution:

X = int(input())
A = int(input())
if X < A:
    print(0)
else:
    print(10)

In this solution, we first check if X is less than A using the "<" operator. If it is, we print 0. If it's not, we print 10.

So, the final solution is:

X = int(input())
A = int(input())
if X < A:
    print(0)
else:
    print(10)

This approach is more concise and easier to read.

1. Aoki replaces N with the difference of N and K.
2. The new value of N is N - K.

Now, let's think about the second operation.

1. Aoki replaces N with the difference of N and K.
2. The new value of N is N - K.

First, we know that the height of each tower is 1 + 2 + 3 +... + 999 = 499500 meters.

We also know that the distance between two adjacent towers is 1 meter.

We are given that the length of the parts of the two towers that are not covered with snow are a meters for the west tower and b meters for the east tower.

We can see that the total length of the two towers is 1000 meters.

We can also see that the length of the parts of the two towers that are not covered with snow is 1000 - (a + b) meters.

We are given that the depth of the snow cover is at least 1 meter.

So, we can set up the following equation:

1000 - (a + b) = x

We can solve this equation by subtracting b from both sides:

999 - (a + b) = x - b

We can see that the left side of the equation is equal to the height of the two towers minus the length of the parts of the two towers that are not covered with snow.

We can divide both sides of the equation by 999 to solve for x:

(a + b) / 999 = x / 999 - b / 999

We can simplify this equation

The difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user is |x - y| + |x - z| + |y - z|.

We need to find the minimum possible value of |x - y| + |x - z| + |y - z|.

Let's consider the following cases:

Let's consider the digits of ABC N.

If N is 111, then the digits of ABC N are 1, 1, and 1.

Kurohashi wants to make his debut in some ABC x such that all the digits of x in base ten are the same.

If we take ABC N as x, then all the digits of x in base ten are the same.

So, the earliest ABC where Kurohashi can make his debut is ABC N.

Therefore, the output is N.

Now, let's consider the case where N is not 111. We can use a loop to iterate through all the possible values of N and find the earliest ABC where Kurohashi can make his debut.

2. We need to find the largest number among A + B, A - B, and A \* B.
3. We know that A and B are integers between -100 and 100.
4. We need to print the largest number.

Let's start with the first case, A + B.

A + B = A - (-B) = A + (-B) = A - B.

So, the largest number among A + B, A - B, and A \* B is A - B.

Let's move on to the second case, A - B.

A - B = A + (-B) = A - (-B) = A + B.

So, the largest number among A + B, A - B, and A \* B is A + B.

Let's move on to the third case, A \* B.

A \* B = A \* (-B) = -A \* B = -A \* (-B) = -A + B.

So, the largest number among A + B, A - B, and A \* B is -A + B.

Therefore, the largest number among A + B, A - B, and A \* B is -A + B.

1. We know that Tanya climbed $n$ stairways.
2. Each stairway has a different number of steps.
3. We know that Tanya pronounced all the numbers from $1$ to the number of steps in each stairway.

Let's start by analyzing the input. We have $n$ numbers, and each number is between $1$ and $1000$. We can assume that the numbers are unique, and there are no duplicates.

We can start by sorting the numbers in ascending order. This will help us to identify the number of stairways that Tanya climbed. We can also use this sorted list to identify the number of steps in each stairway.

Let's say we have a sorted list of numbers: $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$. We can see that there are $5$ numbers, and each number is unique. This means that Tanya climbed $5$ stairways.

Now, let's look at the number of steps in each stairway. We can see that the first stairway has $1$ step, the second stairway has $2$ steps, the third stairway has $3$ steps, the fourth stairway has $4$ steps, and the fifth stairway has $5$ steps.

3. We need to find any positive integer $x$ so there is an integer $k>1$ that $x + 2x + 4x + \dots + 2^{k-1} x = n$.

Let's start with the first test case.

We know that $n = 3$. We need to find any positive integer $x$ so there is an integer $k>1$ that $x + 2x + 4x + \dots + 2^{k-1} x = n$.

Let's try $x = 1$. Then $1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{k-1} = n$. Since $n = 3$, we can see that $k = 2$.

1. If the number is a power of 10, you can divide it by 10 to get the result.
2. If the number is not a power of 10, you can use the algorithm you described to get the result.

This approach is more efficient because it avoids the need to check if the number is a power of 10 for every iteration of the loop. Instead, it uses the fact that the number is a power of 10 to reduce the number of operations required. This can make a big difference if the number is very large, as it can reduce the number of operations required to a much smaller number.

1. First, we need to find the maximum size of the songs that can be copied to the flash drive.
2. Then, we need to find the minimum number of songs that can be compressed to fit all the songs on the flash drive.

Let's consider all possible subsets of the songs that can be compressed.

Let's say we have $k$ songs that can be compressed.

The sum of the sizes of the compressed songs is $k \times b_i$, where $b_i$ is the size of the $i$-th song after compression.

The sum of the sizes of the uncompressed songs is $n \times a_i$, where $a_i$ is the size of the $i$-th song before compression.

The total size of the songs that can be copied to the flash drive is $k \times b_i + (n-k) \times a_i$.

We want to find the minimum value of $k$ such that the total size of the songs that can be copied to the flash drive is less than or equal to $m$.

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We can create a two-dimensional array $dp$ where $dp[i][j]$ represents the minimum number of songs that can be compressed to fit all the songs on the flash drive if we have already compressed $i$ songs and the total size of the compressed songs is $j$.

Let's call the number of pieces of takoyaki he can make in one minute "y".

We know that Takahashi can make at most X pieces of takoyaki at a time, taking T minutes regardless of the number of pieces to make.

So, if he wants to make N pieces of takoyaki, he needs to make N/y pieces of takoyaki in one minute.

Let's start with the first step. We have A apples and P pieces of apple. We can cut an apple into three pieces of apple, and make one apple pie by simmering two pieces of apple in a pan.

Now, let's move to the second step. We can make one apple pie by simmering two of the three pieces of apple.

5. Determine whether this string satisfies the property above.

Let's break down the problem statement.

2. The length of S is between 1 and 10.
3. The length of T is equal to the length of S plus 1.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

2. We can start by finding a string T that is a prefix of S.

Let's write some pseudocode to solve the problem:

Let's start by finding the maximum possible area of the part whose area is not larger than that of the other.

We can start by drawing a line passing through (x,y) to cut the rectangle into two parts.

The area of the part whose area is not larger than that of the other is the area of the smaller part.

We can find the area of the smaller part by finding the area of the triangle formed by the line and the two vertices of the rectangle that are not on the line.

We can find the area of the triangle by using the formula:

Area = (base \* height) / 2

where base is the length of the base of the triangle and height is the length of the height of the triangle.

Given that the line passes through (x,y), we can find the base of the triangle by finding the distance between (x,y) and either of the two vertices of the rectangle that are not on the line.

First, we need to find the number of good pairs of topics.

We can start by considering the first topic.

If the first topic is interesting for the teacher, then we can choose any other topic as the second topic.

If the first topic is not interesting for the teacher, then we can choose any other topic as the second topic, except the first topic.

So, the number of good pairs of topics is equal to the number of interesting topics for the teacher.

Now, let's consider the second topic.

If the second topic is interesting for the teacher, then we can choose any other topic as the first topic.

If the second topic is not interesting for the teacher, then we can choose any other topic as the first topic, except the second topic.

So, the number of good pairs of topics is equal to the number of interesting topics for the teacher.

Now, let's consider the third topic.

If the third topic is interesting for the teacher, then we can choose any other topic as the first topic.

If the third topic is not interesting for the teacher, then we can choose any other topic as the first topic, except the third topic.

So, the number of good pairs of topics is equal to the number of interesting topics for the teacher.

Now, let's consider the fourth topic.

If the fourth topic is interesting for the teacher, then we can choose any other topic as the first topic.

1. First, we need to find all the connected components of the graph. We can do this by using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.
2. Once we have all the connected components, we need to check if each connected component is a cycle. We can do this by checking if the vertices in the connected component can be reordered in such a way that the first vertex is connected with the second vertex by an edge, the second vertex is connected with the third vertex by an edge, and so on, until the last vertex is connected with the first vertex by an edge.
3. Finally, we need to count the number of connected components that are also cycles.

Let's break down the problem into smaller sub-problems.

1. Finding all the connected components: We can use a DFS algorithm to find all the connected components of the graph. We can start by selecting an arbitrary vertex and then perform a DFS traversal from that vertex. During the traversal, we can keep track of the vertices that we have visited and the edges that we have traversed. Once we have visited all the vertices in the graph, we can use the visited vertices and edges to find all the connected components.
2. Checking if a connected component is a cycle: We can use a hash table to keep track of the vertices in the connected component. We can then check if the vertices in the connected component can be reordered in such a way that the first vertex is connected with the second vertex by an edge

1. We are given an undirected tree of $n$ vertices.
2. Some vertices are colored blue, some are colored red, and some are uncolored.
3. It is guaranteed that the tree contains at least one red vertex and at least one blue vertex.
4. We choose an edge and remove it from the tree.
5. The tree falls apart into two connected components.
6. Let's call an edge nice if neither of the resulting components contains vertices of both red and blue colors.
7. How many nice edges are there in the given tree?

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of nice edges in the given tree. We can do this by counting the number of nice edges in each connected component and then summing them up.

Let's start by finding the number of nice edges in each connected component. We can do this by considering each edge in the tree and checking whether it is nice or not.

An edge is nice if it does not contain any vertices of both red and blue colors. We can check this by considering the colors of the vertices that are connected by the edge. If the edge contains vertices of both red and blue colors, then it is not nice.

Once we have determined whether each edge is nice or not, we can count the number of nice edges in each connected component. We can do this by keeping track of the number of nice edges in each component as we traverse the tree.

Finally, we can sum

First, we need to find the list of strings of length $k$ lexicographically not less than $s$ and not greater than $t$. We can do this by generating all possible strings of length $k$ and then filtering out the ones that are not lexicographically not less than $s$ and not greater than $t$.

Next, we need to find the median of this list. The median is the middle element of the list, and we can find it by counting the number of elements in the list and then finding the element at the middle index.

Finally, we need to print the median string.

So, the solution is to generate all possible strings of length $k$ and then filter out the ones that are not lexicographically not less than $s$ and not greater than $t$. Then, find the median of the remaining list and print it.

Next, we can use a priority queue to keep track of the students in the team. We can use the rating as the priority, and the student's index as the value. This way, we can easily find the student with the highest rating and add it to the team.

1. The first step is to find the first element of the strictly increasing sequence. We can find it by looking for the first element of the sequence that is not equal to the previous element. This is because the strictly increasing sequence is strictly increasing, so the first element of the sequence is greater than the previous element.
2. Then, we find the last element of the strictly decreasing sequence. We can find it by looking for the last element of the sequence that is not equal to the next element. This is because the strictly decreasing sequence is strictly decreasing, so the last element of the sequence is less than the next element.
3. After that, we insert the first element of the strictly increasing sequence between the last element of the strictly decreasing sequence and the first element of the strictly increasing sequence.
4. We repeat step 1 to 3 until we have inserted all the elements of the strictly increasing sequence.

1. We have $n$ people, and we want to make two round dances.
2. Each round dance consists of exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ people.
3. Each person should belong to exactly one of these two round dances.

So, we need to find the number of ways to divide $n$ people into two groups of size $\frac{n}{2}$.

Let's consider the case of $n=4$. We have four people, and we want to divide them into two groups of size $2$.

There are $4! = 24$ ways to divide $4$ people into two groups of size $2$.

But, we need to exclude the cases where some people belong to both round dances.

For example, in the case of $n=4$, we have the following two round dances:

* Round dance 1: [1, 2]
* Round dance 2: [3, 4]

But, we need to exclude the case where both people 1 and 2 belong to the same round dance.

So, we need to divide $4$ people into two groups of size $2$ while excluding the cases where some people belong to both round dances.

We can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to count the number of ways to divide $n$ people into two groups of size $\frac{n}{2}$ while excluding the cases where some people belong

1. Initialize a variable `removed` to 0.
2. Iterate through the string `s` and for each letter, check if it is in the set of letters to be removed. If it is, remove it and increment `removed` by 1.
3. If `removed` is equal to `k`, stop the algorithm and return the resulting string.

This approach is more efficient because it only requires one pass through the string, rather than multiple passes as in your original approach. It also avoids the need to check for each letter individually, which can be time-consuming.

First, we need to find the minimum day when Ivan can order all microtransactions he wants.

We know that Ivan has to order exactly $k_i$ microtransactions of the $i$-th type.

We also know that each microtransaction costs $2$ burles usually and $1$ burle if it is on sale.

We also know that there are $n$ types of microtransactions in the game.

We also know that there are $m$ special offers in the game shop.

We also know that the $j$-th special offer $(d_j, t_j)$ means that microtransactions of the $t_j$-th type are on sale during the $d_j$-th day.

We also know that Ivan can order any (possibly zero) number of microtransactions of any types during any day (of course, if he has enough money to do it).

We also know that if the microtransaction he wants to order is on sale then he can buy it for $1$ burle and otherwise he can buy it for $2$ burles.

We can use a dynamic programming algorithm to find the minimum day when Ivan can order all microtransactions he wants.

We can use a hash table to store the information about the microtransactions and special offers.

We can use a loop to iterate through the days and check if Ivan can order all microtransactions he wants on each day.

5. If Bob's card is stronger than Alice's card, Bob will win the game.

1. We know that the string s has the following format: [five lowercase English letters],[seven lowercase English letters],[five lowercase English letters].
2. We also know that the sixth and fourteenth characters in s are,.
3. The other characters in s are lowercase English letters.

Now, let's think about the problem. We need to replace all the commas in the string s with spaces. We can do this by using a regular expression to replace all occurrences of the comma character with a space character.

Here's the code:

import re

def convert_string(s):
    return re.sub(r',',' ', s)

print(convert_string("happy,newyear,enjoy"))

The output will be:
happy newyear enjoy

In this code, we first import the `re` module, which provides functions for working with regular expressions. We then define a function called `convert_string` that takes a string `s` as input. We use the `re.sub` function to replace all occurrences of the comma character with a space character in the string `s`. Finally, we print the resulting string.

3. We can then sort the checkpoints by their distances to each student. We can use a sorting algorithm such as quicksort or mergesort to sort the checkpoints by their distances to each student.
4. Finally, we can print the index of the checkpoint with the smallest distance to each student. We can use a loop to iterate over each student and print the index of the checkpoint with the smallest distance to that student.

Here is the code:

a = int(input())
a_plus_a_squared_plus_a_cubed = a + pow(a, 2) + pow(a, 3)
print(a_plus_a_squared_plus_a_cubed)

Note that we need to convert the input to an integer before we can use it in the calculation. We can use the int() function to convert the input to an integer.

Let's start with the highest price item.

The highest price item is the i-th item, and the regular price is p_i yen.

The discounted price of the highest price item is half the regular price, which is p_i / 2 yen.

The total amount Mr. Takaha will pay for the highest price item is p_i / 2 yen.

Now, let's move on to the remaining N-1 items.

The regular price of the remaining N-1 items is (N-1) \* (p_1 + p_2 +... + p_N-1) yen.

1. We need to check if the input is uppercase or lowercase.
2. If the input is uppercase, we should print A.
3. If it is lowercase, we should print a.

So, we can write a program that checks if the input is uppercase or lowercase and prints the corresponding letter.

Here's an example of how we can do this:

```
# Get the input from the user
alpha = input("Enter a letter: ")

# Convert the input to lowercase
alpha_lower = alpha.lower()

# Check if the input is uppercase
if alpha_lower.isupper():
    print("A")
else:
    print("a")
```

In this program, we first get the input from the user using the `input()` function. We then convert the input to lowercase using the `lower()` method. We then check if the input is uppercase using the `isupper()` method. If the input is uppercase, we print "A". If it's lowercase, we print "a".

So, if the input is "B", the program will print "A" because "B" is uppercase. If the input is "b", the program will print "a" because "b" is lowercase.

There are 3K + 1 = 3001 different values of X, Y, and Z that satisfy the condition X + Y + Z = 0.

Now, we need to find the number of triples of X, Y, and Z that satisfy the condition X + Y + Z = S.

We can do this by subtracting the number of triples of X, Y, and Z that satisfy the condition X + Y + Z = 0 from the total number of triples of X, Y, and Z that satisfy the condition 0 ≤ X, Y, Z ≤ K.

There are 3K + 1 = 3001 - 3001 = 0 triples of X, Y, and Z that satisfy the condition X + Y + Z = S.

Therefore, the number of triples of X, Y, and Z that satisfy the condition X + Y + Z = S is 0.

1. We have a digit sequence S of length 4.
2. We are wondering which of the following formats S is in:
	* YYMM format: the last two digits of the year and the two-digit representation of the month (example: 01 for January), concatenated in this order
	* MMYY format: the two-digit representation of the month and the last two digits of the year, concatenated in this order
3. If S is valid in only YYMM format, print YYMM; if S is valid in only MMYY format, print MMYY; if S is valid in both formats, print AMBIGUOUS; if S is valid in neither format, print NA.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. Check if the last two digits of the year are valid.
2. Check if the two-digit representation of the month is valid.
3. If both conditions are true, print AMBIGUOUS.
4. If only one condition is true, print the corresponding format.
5. If neither condition is true, print NA.

Now, let's write the code.

1. We need to find the number of ways to choose a pair of an even number and an odd number from the positive integers between 1 and K (inclusive).
2. The order does not matter.
3. The input is given from Standard Input in the following format: K.
4. The output is the number of ways to choose a pair of an even number and an odd number from the positive integers between 1 and K (inclusive).

Let's start with the first step. We need to find the number of ways to choose a pair of an even number and an odd number from the positive integers between 1 and K (inclusive).

We can start by choosing an even number from the positive integers between 1 and K (inclusive). There are K even numbers between 1 and K (inclusive).

Then, we need to choose an odd number from the positive integers between 1 and K (inclusive). There are K odd numbers between 1 and K (inclusive).

So, the total number of ways to choose a pair of an even number and an odd number from the positive integers between 1 and K (inclusive) is:

K \* K = K^2

Therefore, the number of ways to choose a pair of an even number and an odd number from the positive integers between 1 and K (inclusive) is K^2.

1. First, we need to find the number of digits in the binary representation of N.
2. We can use the formula for the number of digits in a binary number, which is:

log2(N) + 1

3. Since we are given the base K, we need to convert the number of digits in the binary representation of N to the base K representation.
4. We can use the formula for the number of digits in a base K representation, which is:

logK(N) + 1

5. Since we are given the number of digits in the binary representation of N, we can directly use the formula for the number of digits in a base K representation.
6. Therefore, the solution is:

logK(N) + 1

Note that we need to add 1 to the result because the number of digits in the base K representation of N includes the leading digit.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sheets of paper Takahashi needs to print the document.

2. At least how many sheets of paper does he need?

To find out how many sheets of paper Takahashi needs, we need to divide the number of pages by two.

We know that N is an integer because it is given in the problem statement.

5. One suggestion to help improve my approach is to consider the case where N is an odd number. In this case, we need to add an extra sheet of paper to print the remaining page. This can be done by adding 1 to the result of dividing N by 2. This will ensure that we have enough sheets of paper to print all the pages double-sided.

2. We also know that Lunlun, the Dachshund, will take out three consecutive digits from S, treat them as a single integer X, and bring it to her master.
3. The master's favorite number is 753. The closer to this number, the better.
4. We need to find the minimum possible (absolute) difference between X and 753.

Let's start by considering all possible combinations of three consecutive digits from S. We can do this by considering all possible combinations of three digits from the first seven digits of S, and then all possible combinations of three digits from the last seven digits of S.

Let's consider the first seven digits of S: 1234567. We can take out the first, second, and third digits (123) and form X = 123. The difference between X and 753 is 753 - 123 = 630.

Let's consider the last seven digits of S: 8765432. We can take out the seventh, eighth, and ninth digits (876) and form X = 876. The difference between X and 753 is 753 - 876 = -123.

First, we need to find the minimum number of people who could have broken into the basement. We can do this by finding the minimum number of swords that are left in the basement after the theft.

Let's call the minimum number of swords that are left in the basement after the theft $x$. We know that the total number of swords that are left in the basement after the theft is $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n$.

We can use the equation:

$$x = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n}$$

to find $x$.

Now, we need to find the minimum number of people who could have broken into the basement. We can do this by finding the minimum number of swords that each person could have taken.

Let's call the minimum number of swords that each person could have taken $z$. We know that the total number of swords that each person could have taken is $nz$.

We can use the equation:

$$z = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n}$$

to find $z$.

Now, we can find the minimum number of people who could have broken into the basement by dividing $x$ by $z$.

1. We are given a forest, which means that each connected component is a tree.
2. We need to add some edges to the graph so that it becomes a tree and the diameter of the tree is minimal possible.
3. The diameter of a connected undirected graph is the maximum number of edges in the shortest path between any pair of its vertices.
4. We need to find the shortest path between any pair of vertices and add the minimum number of edges to make it a tree.

Let's start by finding the shortest path between any pair of vertices. We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.

We can start from any vertex and perform Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path to all other vertices. We can keep track of the shortest path and the number of edges in the shortest path.

Once we have the shortest path, we can add the minimum number of edges to make it a tree. We can do this by adding edges between the vertices in the shortest path.

Let's consider an example. Suppose we have a forest with 4 vertices and 2 edges. The shortest path between any pair of vertices is 2 edges. We can add 2 edges to make it a tree.

Now, let's consider another example. Suppose we have a forest with 5 vertices and 3 edges. The shortest path between any pair of vertices is 3 edges. We can add

1. We need to find the subset of vertices with the maximum total weight.
2. We need to find the subset of vertices such that there is no pair of vertices with the distance $k$ or less between them in this subset.

Let's start with the second point. We can use a BFS (breadth-first search) algorithm to find the subset of vertices such that there is no pair of vertices with the distance $k$ or less between them in this subset.

We can use a priority queue to store the vertices and their distances from the starting vertex. We can also use a hash set to store the vertices that are already visited.

We can start the BFS from the starting vertex. We can enqueue the starting vertex and set its distance to 0. We can then dequeue the vertex and set its distance to 1. We can then enqueue all of its neighbors that are not already visited and set their distances to 1. We can repeat this process until the queue is empty.

We can then find the subset of vertices with the maximum total weight. We can use a hash set to store the vertices that are in the subset. We can then iterate through all of the vertices and add them to the hash set if their distance from the starting vertex is less than or equal to $k$.

Finally, we can print the maximum total weight of the subset.

3. We need to find the dormitory number where this letter should be delivered.

Let's start with the third step. We need to find the dormitory number where this letter should be delivered.

We know that the room number among all rooms of all dormitories is written on an envelope. We also know that the rooms of the first dormitory go first, the rooms of the second dormitory go after them and so on.

So, we can find the dormitory number by dividing the room number among all rooms of all dormitories by the number of rooms in each dormitory.

For example, if the room number is 12, we can find the dormitory number by dividing 12 by 10 (the number of rooms in the first dormitory).

12 / 10 = 1

So, the dormitory number is 1.

Now, let's move on to the second step. We need to find the room number in a dormitory where this letter should be delivered.

Let's start by breaking down the problem. We need to replace each digit 1 with 9 and each digit 9 with 1 in n.

Let's consider the first digit of n, which is 1. We need to replace it with 9. So, the first digit of the answer will be 9.

Now, let's consider the second digit of n, which is 1. We need to replace it with 9. So, the second digit of the answer will be 9.

Therefore, the answer will be 991.

For example, if the string $b$ is "abbaac", then the substrings of length $2$ are "ab", "ba", "ac".

Now, we need to find the string $a$ that corresponds to the substrings of length $2$ of the string $b$. We can do this by finding the longest substring of length $2$ in the string $b$ that is a substring of the string $a$.

For example, if the string $b$ is "abbaac", then the longest substring of length $2$ in the string $b$ that is a substring of the string $a$ is "ba". Therefore, the string $a$ that Bob came up with is "abac".

First, we need to understand the problem. The problem is to find the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days.

Second, we need to understand the input. The input is a sequence of $n$ integers, where each integer represents the temperature measure during a day.

Third, we need to understand the output. The output is a real number, which represents the heat intensity value.

Now, let's think about the solution. We need to find the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days. We can do this by calculating the average temperature for each segment of not less than $k$ consecutive days and then finding the maximum of these averages.

Let's start by calculating the average temperature for each segment of not less than $k$ consecutive days. We can do this by using the formula for the average temperature of a segment of $n$ consecutive days, which is $\frac{\sum \limits_{i = x}^{y} a_i}{y - x + 1}$.

We can then find the maximum of these averages by finding the maximum of the average temperatures for each segment. We can do this by using a simple algorithm such as the following:

1. Initialize a variable $max$ to $-\infty$.
2. For each segment of not less than $k$ consecutive days, calculate the average temperature and compare it to $max$. If the average temperature is greater than

This can help us avoid getting stuck in a single approach and can make the problem more manageable. Additionally, we can use a combination of sorting algorithms and swapping operations to solve the problem. By using a combination of these techniques, we can solve the problem more efficiently and effectively.

1. We are given a string $t$ that is the result of encryption of some string $s$.
2. We need to find the string $s$ that after encryption it equals $t$.
3. We know that the encryption algorithm is as follows:

"b" $\to$ "baa" $\to$ "baabbb".

So, we need to find the string $s$ that after encryption it equals $t$.

Let's start with the first letter of $t$. If the first letter of $t$ is "b", then the first letter of $s$ should be "a".

Let's continue with the second letter of $t$. If the second letter of $t$ is "a", then the second letter of $s$ should be "b".

Let's continue with the third letter of $t$. If the third letter of $t$ is "b", then the third letter of $s$ should be "a".

Let's continue with the fourth letter of $t$. If the fourth letter of $t$ is "b", then the fourth letter of $s$ should be "b".

Now, we have the first four letters of $s$. We can continue this process until we have the entire string $s$.

1. First, we need to find the number of recolors needed to make the garland nice.
2. Then, we need to find the nice garland with the minimum number of recolors.

Let's start with the first step.

We can see that the garland "BRB" is not nice because the distance between the two red lamps is not divisible by three.

So, we need to recolor one of the red lamps to make the garland nice.

Let's recolor the first red lamp to green.

Now, the garland "BGRB" is nice because the distance between the two green lamps is divisible by three.

So, we need to recolor one of the green lamps to blue.

Let's recolor the second green lamp to blue.

Now, the garland "BGBRB" is nice because the distance between the two blue lamps is divisible by three.

So, we need to recolor one of the blue lamps to red.

Let's recolor the third blue lamp to red.

Now, the garland "BGRG" is nice because the distance between the two red lamps is divisible by three.

So, we need to recolor one of the red lamps to green.

Let's recolor the fourth red lamp to green.

1. We are given two strings S and T of length N each, both consisting of lowercase English letters.
2. We need to form a new string by alternating the characters of S and the characters of T.
3. We need to print this new string.

Let's start with the first character of S and the first character of T.

1.1. We take the first character of S, which is 'i'.
1.2. We take the first character of T, which is 'c'.
1.3. We concatenate the two characters, which gives us 'ic'.

Now, we move on to the second character of S and the second character of T.

2.1. We take the second character of S, which is 'p'.
2.2. We take the second character of T, which is 'c'.
2.3. We concatenate the two characters, which gives us 'pc'.

We continue this process until we reach the end of both strings.

3.1. We take the last character of S, which is 'p'.

1. We know that each station is operated by one of the two railway companies, A and B.
2. We also know that each character of S is A or B.
3. We need to determine if there is a pair of stations that will be connected by a bus service.

Let's consider the following cases:

Case 1: Company A operates Station 1 and Company B operates Station 2.
In this case, there will be a bus service between Station 1 and 2, so we print Yes.

Case 2: Company A operates Station 1 and Company B operates Station 3.
In this case, there will be a bus service between Station 1 and 3, so we print Yes.

Case 3: Company A operates Station 2 and Company B operates Station 3.
In this case, there will be a bus service between Station 2 and 3, so we print Yes.

Case 4: Company A operates Station 1 and Company B operates Station 1.
In this case, there will be no bus service between Station 1 and 1, so we print No.

By only considering the first two cases, we can avoid considering the fourth case, which is unnecessary. This will make our approach more efficient and easier to understand.

1. We have a string of length 3, S, that represents the weather records for some consecutive three days.
2. Each character of S is either S or R, which means it was sunny or rainy on the corresponding day.
3. We need to find the maximum number of consecutive rainy days in this period.

Let's consider an example. Suppose we have the following string: RRS.

1. The first character is R, which means it was rainy on the first day.
2. The second character is R, which means it was rainy on the second day.
3. The third character is S, which means it was sunny on the third day.

Now, we need to find the maximum number of consecutive rainy days. In this case, we have two consecutive rainy days, which is the maximum.

So, the output should be 2.

Here is the updated approach:

1. Initialize a variable, max_consecutive_rainy_days, to 0.
2. Iterate through the characters of the input string, S.
3. If the current character is R, increment the max_consecutive_rainy_days variable by 1.

Let's consider the first query. We need to find the minimum number of coins that is necessary to obtain the value $b_j = 8$.

We can use the following approach:

1. We can use one coin with the value of $8$.
2. We can use two coins with the values of $4$ and $4$.

2. The goal is to distribute the cards in such a way that each player gets exactly $k$ cards. After the cards are distributed, each player counts the number of cards they have that contain their favorite number. If they get no cards with their favorite number, their joy level is $0$.
3. We need to find the maximum possible total joy levels of the players after the cards are distributed.

Let's start by considering the first player. They will get $k$ cards, and each card will have a number from $1$ to $10^5$. We need to find the maximum number of cards that contain the first player's favorite number. Let's call this number $x$.

We know that $x \leq k$, since each player will get exactly $k$ cards. We also know that $x \geq 0$, since each player will get at least one card.

Now, let's consider the second player. They will get $k$ cards, and each card will have a number from $1$ to $10^5$. We need to find the maximum number of cards that contain the second player's favorite

1. First, we need to find the minimum number of operations required to obtain the array of equal elements.
2. We can use the following algorithm to find the minimum number of operations:

a. Find the minimum element in the array.
b. Find the maximum element in the array.
c. If the minimum element is not equal to the maximum element, then we need to perform the operation of adding the absolute difference between the minimum and maximum elements to the minimum element.
d. If the minimum element is equal to the maximum element, then we need to perform the operation of subtracting the absolute difference between the minimum and maximum elements from the minimum element.

Let's apply this algorithm to the given example.

1. The minimum element in the array is 1.
2. The maximum element in the array is 6.
3. The minimum element is not equal to the maximum element, so we need to perform the operation of adding the absolute difference between the minimum and maximum elements to the minimum element.
4. The absolute difference between the minimum and maximum elements is 5.
5. So, we need to perform the operation of adding 5 to the minimum element.

The minimum number of operations required to obtain the array of equal elements is 2. The operations are:

1. Adding 5 to the minimum element.
2. Subtracting 5 from the maximum element.

The problem is to find the suitable set of books such that Alice likes at least $k$ books from the chosen set and Bob likes at least $k$ books from the chosen set. The total reading time of these books is minimized.

The input is the number of books $n$ and the number of books Alice and Bob like $k$. The input also contains the description of each book, which includes the amount of time required for reading the book, whether Alice likes the book or not, and whether Bob likes the book or not.

The output is the minimum total reading time of the suitable set of books. If there is no solution, the output is only one integer -1.

Now, let's think about the solution.

Now, let's think about the problem.

To check if the array is good, we need to check if the length of the array is divisible by 6. If the length is divisible by 6, we can split the array into 6 subarrays of length 1. If the length is not divisible by 6, we can't split the array into 6 subarrays.

To check if the array is good, we also need to check if the elements in the array are in the required sequence.

We can start with $a = 5$ and $b = 5$. We don't need to do anything. The answer is $0$.

1. Polycarp wants to prepare the maximum number of gifts for $k$ girls. Each gift will consist of exactly two boxes. The girls should be able to share each gift equally, so the total amount of candies in a gift (in a pair of boxes) should be divisible by $k$. In other words, two boxes $i$ and $j$ ($i \ne j$) can be combined as a gift if $d_i + d_j$ is divisible by $k$.

1. We are given a string S of length N consisting of A, B, and C.
2. We are given an integer K which is between 1 and N (inclusive).
3. We need to print the string S after lowercasing the K-th character in it.

Now, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. We need to find the K-th character in the string S.
2. We need to lowercase the K-th character.
3. We need to print the modified string S.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. We can use a for loop to iterate through the characters of the string S.
2. We can use an if statement to check if the current character is the K-th character.
3. We can use a StringBuilder object to modify the string S in place.
4. We can print the modified string S.

Here's the code:

2. Then, we need to sort the restaurants in each city by their scores in descending order.
3. Finally, we need to print the identification numbers of the restaurants in the order they are introduced in the book.

Let's write the code in Python:

```
# Sort the restaurants by their city names in lexicographical order
restaurants.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

# Sort the restaurants in each city by their scores in descending order
for city in restaurants:
    city.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Print the identification numbers of the restaurants in the order they are introduced in the book
for restaurant in restaurants:
    print(restaurant[2])
```

In this version, we use the `sort()` method to sort the restaurants by their city names in lexicographical order. We then use a for loop to iterate over the cities and sort the restaurants in each city by their scores in descending order. Finally, we use another for loop to print the identification numbers of the restaurants in the order they are introduced in the book.

1. We know that Takahashi has K 500-yen coins.
2. We also know that the total amount of money in the coins is at least X yen.
3. We want to determine whether the total amount of money in the coins is greater than or equal to X yen.

Let's call the total amount of money in the coins T.

We know that T is at least X yen, so T >= X.

We also know that each coin is 500 yen, so the total amount of money in the coins is equal to K x 500 yen.

So, we can write the equation:

T = K x 500 yen

We want to determine whether T >= X yen.

We can simplify the equation as:

K x 500 yen >= X yen

We can simplify the equation further as:

K >= X / 500

We can see that K is an integer, so we can round X/500 to the nearest integer.

Let's call the rounded value G.

If G >= K, then we know that the total amount of money in the coins is greater than or equal to X yen.

So, we can print "Yes" if G >= K, and "No" otherwise.

Here is the updated code:

1. Snuke throws the die and gets a number between 1 and N.
2. If the number is between 1 and K-1, Snuke flips the coin until the score becomes 0 or K or above.
3. If the score becomes 0, Snuke loses.
4. If the score becomes K or above, Snuke wins.

Let's consider the probability of Snuke winning for all numbers between 1 and N together.

1. If the number is 1, Snuke needs to get four consecutive heads from four coin flips to obtain a score of 10 or above. The probability of this happening is (1/3) × (1/2)^4 = 1/48.
2. If the number is 2, Snuke needs to get three consecutive heads from three coin flips to obtain a score of 10 or above. The probability of this happening is (1/3) × (1/2)^3 = 1/24.
3. If the number is 3, Snuke needs to get two consecutive heads from two coin flips to obtain a score of 10 or above. The probability of this happening is (1/3) × (1/2)^2 = 1/12.

Therefore, the probability that Snuke wins is:

2. We are given the values of r, D, and x_{2000}.
3. We need to calculate the values of x_{2001},..., x_{2010}.
4. We need to print the values in order.

Let's start with the first value, x_{2001}.

We know that x_{2001} = rx_{2000} - D.

We are given that r is between 2 and 5, so we can substitute r = 2.

We are also given that D is between 1 and 100, so we can substitute D = 10.

We are also given that x_{2000} = 20.

So, we can calculate x_{2001} as follows:

x_{2001} = rx_{2000} - D = 2 \times 20 - 10 = 30.

Now, let's calculate the next value, x_{2002}.

We know that x_{2002} = rx_{2001} - D.

We can substitute x_{2001} = 30, so we get:

x_{2002} = r

3. We need to find a way to split the array such that $sum_1 = sum_3$.

Let's start with the third point. We need to find a way to split the array such that $sum_1 = sum_3$.

We can start by sorting the array in non-decreasing order. Let's call the sorted array $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$.

We can then split the array into three parts: the first part contains the first $a$ elements of the sorted array, the second part contains the next $b$ elements of the sorted array, and the third part contains the remaining $c$ elements of the sorted array.

We can then calculate the sums of the first and third parts as follows:

$$sum_1 = \sum\limits_{1 \le i \le a}d_i,$$ $$sum_3 = \sum\limits_{a + 1 \le i \le a + b}d_i,$$ $$sum_3 = \sum\limits_{a + b + 1 \le i \le n}d_i.$$

4. We have $x = \max(a, b) = 3$, $y = \max(a, c) = 2$, and $z = \max(b, c) = 3$.
5. We can see that $a = 3$, $b = 2$, and $c = 3$ satisfies all three conditions.

5. We can fill the array with the maximum number of objects that can be packed in each box, starting from the first box and the first object.
6. We can use the following recurrence relation to fill the array:

$$max_i(j) = \max\left(max_{i-1}(j), max_{i-1}(j-a_i)\right)$$

where $max_i(j)$ is the maximum number of objects that can be packed in the $i$-th box when we have $j$ objects left to pack.

2. Then, we need to check which substrings can be typed using only the available letters.

Let's denote the length of the string $s$ as $n$.

There are $\frac{n (n + 1)}{2}$ substrings of the string $s$.

Now, we need to find the number of substrings that can be typed using only the available letters $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k$.

We can use a hash table or a set to keep track of which substrings have already been typed.

Here is an example of how you can implement this approach in Python:

def count_typed_substrings(s, c):

4. We can define $f(i, k)$ recursively as follows:

$$f(i, k) = \max\left\{f(i-1, k-1), f(i-1, k+1)\right\}$$

where $f(i-1, k-1)$ is the maximum length of alternating subsequence of length $k-1$ that starts from the $(i-1)$th element of $a$, and $f(i-1, k+1)$ is the maximum length of alternating subsequence of length $k+1$ that starts from the $(i-1)$th element of $a$.

5. We can initialize $f(i, 1)$ as $1$ for all $i$, since an alternating subsequence of length $1$ can only start from the $i$th element of $a$.
6. We can then compute $f(i, k)$ for all $i$ and $k$ using the recurrence relation.

2. Next, we need to find the maximum degree of the vertices in the spanning tree. We can do this by keeping track of the number of edges incident to each vertex in the spanning tree.
3. Finally, we need to print the edges of the spanning tree such that the maximum degree over all vertices is maximum possible. We can do this by iterating through the edges of the spanning tree and printing each edge that has the maximum degree.

Let's start with the first step. We can use Kruskal's algorithm to find a spanning tree of the given graph. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Sort the edges of the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.
2. Pick the edge with the minimum weight and add it to the spanning tree.
3. If the edge connects two vertices that are not in the same connected component, merge the two connected components.
4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until all edges are added to the spanning tree.

Now, let's move on to the second step. We need to find the maximum degree of the vertices in the spanning tree. We can do this by keeping track of the number of edges incident to each vertex in the spanning tree. We can use a hash table or a map to store the degree of each vertex

2. We have one figure in the cell $(1, 1)$.
3. We have to move the figure to the cell $(n, n)$.

Let's start by considering the case where $n = 1$. In this case, we have only one cell, and we can move the figure to that cell in one move. Therefore, the answer is $1$.

Now, let's consider the case where $n > 1$. We can divide the board into four quadrants: the top-left quadrant, the top-right quadrant, the bottom-left quadrant, and the bottom-right quadrant.

In the top-left quadrant, we have $n-1$ cells, and we can move the figure to each of these cells in one move. Therefore, the answer for the top-left quadrant is $n-1$.

In the top-right quadrant, we have $n-1$ cells, and we can move the figure to each of these cells in one move. Therefore, the answer for the top-right quadrant is $n-1$.

In the bottom-left quadrant, we have $n-1$ cells, and we can move the figure to each of these cells in one move. Therefore, the answer for the bottom-left quadrant is $n-1$.

First, we need to understand the problem. We are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. In one move, we can jump from the position $i$ to the position $i - a_i$ (if $1 \le i - a_i$) or to the position $i + a_i$ (if $i + a_i \le n$).

For each position $i$ from $1$ to $n$, we want to know the minimum the number of moves required to reach any position $j$ such that $a_j$ has the opposite parity from $a_i$ (i.e. if $a_i$ is odd then $a_j$ has to be even and vice versa).

Now, let's think about the problem in a more abstract way. We can think of the array $a$ as a graph, where each element $a_i$ represents a node in the graph. We can move from one node to another node in the graph in one move, and we can only move to a node that is at most $a_i$ positions away from the current node.

Now, we want to find the shortest path between two nodes in the graph. One option is to use Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) with a queue or stack to keep track of the nodes to visit.

2. Then, we need to find the string that Nikolay obtains after performing the operations.

Let's start with the first step.

To find the number of operations that Nikolay needs to perform, we need to find the number of prefixes of even length in the initial string.

A prefix of even length is a string that starts at the beginning of the string and ends at the position of the last letter of the string.

For example, in the string "ababab", the prefixes of even length are "ab", "abab", and "ababab".

There are three prefixes of even length in the string "ababab".

So, the number of operations that Nikolay needs to perform is 3.

Now, let's move on to the second step.

To find the string that Nikolay obtains after performing the operations, we need to find the string that Nikolay obtains after performing the operations on the initial string.

Let's start with the string "ababab".

If Nikolay performs the operation of replacing the first 'b' with 'a' and the last 'b' with 'a', the resulting string is "abaaba".

We know that A and B are different, so we can't have A = B.

We also know that A and B are both wrong, so we can't have A = 1 or A = 2 or A = 3.

Similarly, we can't have B = 1 or B = 2 or B = 3.

4. We can write the volume of the cuboid as:

V = l \* w \* h

where l, w, and h are the dimensions of the cuboid.
5. We are given that the sum of the dimensions is L.
6. We can write the sum of the dimensions as:

l + w + h = L

7. We can rearrange this equation to solve for h:

h = L - l - w

8. Now we have two equations:

V = l \* w \* h

l + w + h = L

We can use these equations to find the maximum possible volume of the rectangular cuboid.

9. We can start by finding the maximum possible value of h.

h = L - l - w

We can substitute this equation into the first equation:

V = l \* w \* (L - l - w)

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by l and w:

V = l^2 \* w^2 \* (L - l - w)

We can simplify this further

In this code, we first read the input from the user and store it in the variable N. Then, we use a switch statement to check the age of the user. If the user is one year old, we print "Hello World". If the user is two years old, we read two integers A and B from the user and print A+B. Otherwise, we print "Invalid age".

1. If it is the first move, he chooses any element and deletes it;
2. If it is the second or any next move:
	* if the last deleted element was odd, Polycarp chooses any even element and deletes it;
	* if the last deleted element was even, Polycarp chooses any odd element and deletes it.
3. If after some move Polycarp cannot make a move, the game ends.

Let's denote the sum of non-deleted elements of the array after end of the game as $S$.

If Polycarp can delete the whole array, then the sum of non-deleted elements is zero.

Let's consider the case when Polycarp cannot delete the whole array.

If Polycarp chooses the first element of the array, then the sum of non-deleted elements is $a_1$.

If Polycarp chooses the second element of the array, then the sum of non-deleted elements is $a_1 + a_2$.

If Polycarp chooses the third element of the array, then the sum of non-deleted elements is $a_1 + a_2 + a_3$.

In general, if Polycarp chooses the $i$th element of the array, then the sum of non-deleted elements is $a_1 + a_2 +... + a_i$.

First, we need to find the number of elements in the array that have remainder $0$ when divided by $m$. We can do this by using a hash table to keep track of the number of elements with each remainder.

Let $h$ be a hash table with keys $0, 1, \ldots, m-1$. Initialize all values in $h$ to $0$.

Now, for each element $a_i$ in the array, we can calculate its remainder $r_i$ when divided by $m$. We can do this by using the modulo operator: $r_i = a_i \mod m$.

If $r_i = 0$, we can increment the value in $h$ corresponding to key $0$ by $1$. Otherwise, we can increment the value in $h$ corresponding to key $r_i$ by $1$.

Once we have calculated the number of elements in the array with each remainder, we can find the minimum number of moves required to satisfy the condition. We can do this by finding the maximum value in $h$ and subtracting it from $n$.

For example, let's say we have an array $a$ with $n = 10$ elements and $m = 3$. We can use the hash table $h$ to keep track of the number of elements in $a$ with each remainder.

After calculating the number of elements in $a$ with each remainder, we can find

Let's say that the minimum number of days that Ivan needs to buy all the microtransactions of type $i$ is $d_i$. We can calculate $d_i$ by finding the minimum number of days that Ivan needs to buy all the microtransactions of type $i$ if he buys all the microtransactions of type $i$ on sale.

Let's say that the minimum number of days that Ivan needs to buy all the microtransactions of type $i$ on sale is $d_i^s$. We can calculate $d_i^s$ by finding the minimum number of days that Ivan needs to buy all the microtransactions of type $i$ on sale if he buys all the microtransactions of type $i$ on sale.

Let's say that the minimum number of days that Ivan needs to buy all the microtransactions of type $i$ not on sale is $d_i^n$.

Let's say the programming skills of the students are $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. We can sort them in ascending order as follows:

$$a_1 \le a_2 \le a_3 \le \dots \le a_n$$

Now, we can find the maximum and minimum values of the programming skills of the students as follows:

Now, we need to find the number of round numbers that can be formed using the digits of $n$. We can do this by counting the number of digits that are equal to zero.

First, we need to find a string that has at least $k$ distinct characters and is sorted in non-decreasing order. We can start with a string of all distinct characters, and then sort it in non-decreasing order.

Let's consider the permutation $p$ first. We can sort the string of all distinct characters according to the permutation $p$. We can do this by iterating through the characters of the string and swapping them according to the permutation $p$.

Now, we need to make sure that the string is sorted in non-decreasing order. We can do this by iterating through the characters of the string and comparing them with the previous character. If the current character is less than or equal to the previous character, we can swap them.

Now, we need to make sure that the string has at least $k$ distinct characters. We can do this by keeping track of the number of distinct characters in the string. If the number of distinct characters is less than $k$, we can swap two characters that are not distinct.

Finally, we need to make sure that the string suits the given permutations. We can do this by checking if the string is a permutation of the original string according to the permutations $p$ and $q$. If it is not, we can swap two characters that are not in the correct position according to the permutations $p$ and $q$.

1. First, we need to find the number of occurrences of each element in the sequence.
2. Then, we need to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed so that the sequence is a good sequence.

Let's start with the first step. We can use a hash table to store the number of occurrences of each element in the sequence.

For example, if the input sequence is (3, 3, 3, 3), the hash table will look like this:

{3: 4}

This means that the element 3 occurs 4 times in the sequence.

Now, let's move on to the second step. We need to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed so that the sequence is a good sequence.

We can use a greedy algorithm to solve this problem. We start by removing the element with the smallest number of occurrences. In this case, we remove the element 3.

Now, the hash table looks like this:

{}

This means that the sequence is a good sequence.

Therefore, the minimum number of elements that need to be removed is 1.

3. Snuke's objective is to permute the element in a so that the following condition is satisfied:
 - For each 1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1, the product of a_i and a_{i + 1} is a multiple of 4.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. We need to find a permutation of the elements in a such that the product of each pair of consecutive elements is a multiple of 4.
2. We can start by finding a permutation of the elements in a such that the product of each pair of consecutive elements is a multiple of 2.
3. We can then find a permutation of the elements in a such that the product of each pair of consecutive elements is a multiple of 4 by multiplying each pair of consecutive elements by 2.

Now, let's think about how we can find a permutation of the elements in a such that the product of each pair of consecutive elements is a multiple of 2.

One way to do this is to use a sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort, to sort the elements in a in non-decreasing order. This will ensure that the product of each pair of consecutive elements is a multiple of 2.

3. If s' < t', we print Yes; otherwise, we print No.

Let's start with the first step. We can rearrange the characters in s and t by swapping them. For example, if s = "yx", we can rearrange it to "xy" by swapping the first and second characters. Similarly, if t = "axy", we can rearrange it to "yxa" by swapping the first and second characters.

Now, let's move on to the second step. We need to compare the new strings s' and t' using the lexicographic order. We can do this by comparing the characters in each string in order. For example, if s' = "xy" and t' = "yxa", we can compare the first characters of each string, which are "x" and "y". Since "x" comes before "y" in alphabetical order, we know that s' < t'.

Finally, we print Yes because s' < t'.

The maximum number of friendly pairs is G + (N - G) / 2.

This is because for each red point that has a smaller x-coordinate than the corresponding blue point, we can form a friendly pair with the corresponding blue point. For each red point that does not have a smaller x-coordinate than the corresponding blue point, we cannot form a friendly pair. Therefore, the total number of friendly pairs is G + (N - G) / 2.

Choose any positive odd integer $x$ ($x > 0$) and replace $a$ with $a+x$;  choose any positive even integer $y$ ($y > 0$) and replace $a$ with $a-y$. 

We can perform as many such operations as we want. We can choose the same numbers $x$ and $y$ in different moves.

2. We have to remove exactly one element in each of the two chosen sequences.
3. We have to print "YES" if it is possible to choose two sequences such that they satisfy given conditions, otherwise print "NO".
4. We have to print two integers $i$, $x$ ($1 \le i \le k, 1 \le x \le n_i$), in the third line — two integers $j$, $y$ ($1 \le j \le k, 1 \le y \le n_j$). It means that the sum of the elements of the $i$-th sequence without the element with index $x$ equals to the sum of the elements of the $j$-th sequence without the element with index $y$.

1. Find the sum of the array.
2. Find the first and last indices of the array that are not equal to the sum.
3. Check if the sum of the array is equal to the sum of the first index to the last index.

Let's call the sum of the array S.
Let's call the first index i.
Let's call the last index j.

We can check if S is equal to the sum of the first index to the last index by checking if S is equal to the sum of the elements in the range [i, j].

If S is equal to the sum of the first index to the last index, then we can return true.

If S is not equal to the sum of the first index to the last index, then we can return false.

Here is the updated code in pseudocode:

Given an array A of integers, return true if and only if we can partition the array into three non-empty parts with equal sums.

Formally, we can partition the array if we can find indexes i+1 < j with (A[0] + A[1] +... + A[i] == A[i+1] + A[i+2] +... + A[j-1] == A[j] + A[j-1] +... + A[A.length - 1])

1. First, we need to count the number of times each string appears in the input. We can do this by creating a dictionary where the keys are the strings and the values are the number of times they appear.
2. Next, we need to find the string that appears the most number of times. We can do this by keeping track of the maximum number of times a string appears and the string that appears that number of times.
3. Finally, we need to print all the strings that appear the maximum number of times in lexicographical order. We can do this by sorting the strings in the dictionary by their values (i.e., the number of times they appear) and then printing them in order.

Here is an example of how this solution might look in code:
```
# Read in the input
n = int(input())
strings = []
for i in range(n):
    strings.append(input())

# Create a dictionary to keep track of the number of times each string appears
counts = {}

1. We need to extract all the characters in the odd-indexed positions.
2. We need to concatenate them to form a string.

Let's start with the first step. We can use a for loop to iterate through the characters in the string. We can use the modulo operator (%) to find the remainder of the index of each character divided by 2. If the remainder is 1, we know that the character is in an odd-indexed position.

Now, let's move on to the second step. We need to concatenate all the characters in the odd-indexed positions. We can use a vector to store the characters in the odd-indexed positions. We can add each character to the vector as we find it in the odd-indexed positions.

Here's the code:
```
string s = "atcoder";
vector<char> oddChars;

for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 1) {

2. We need to check if the last character in B and the initial character in C are the same.

If both conditions are true, we print YES. Otherwise, we print NO.

So, we need to write a program that checks if the last character in A and the initial character in B are the same, and if the last character in B and the initial character in C are the same. If both conditions are true, we print YES. Otherwise, we print NO.

    if A[-1] == B[0] and B[-1] == C[0]:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"

A, B, and C are the three strings that we want to check. We use the [-1] operator to get the last character of each string, and the [0] operator to get the first character of each string. We then use the == operator to check if the last character of A is the same as the first character of B, and if the last character of B is the same as the first character of C. If both conditions are true, we return "YES". Otherwise, we return "NO".

4. If the number of digits in A is less than the number of digits in B, then A is less in magnitude.
5. If the number of digits in A is equal to the number of digits in B, then we need to compare the individual digits of each number.
6. If the individual digits of A are greater than the individual digits of B, then A is greater in magnitude.
7. If the individual digits of A are less than the individual digits of B, then A is less in magnitude.
8. If the individual digits of A are equal to the individual digits of B, then we need to compare the next digit of each number.
9. We repeat this process until we find a difference between the two numbers.

So, if b is A, we need to print T. If b is C, we need to print G. If b is G, we need to print C. If b is T, we need to print A.

So, we can write a program that takes the input b and prints the corresponding base using a single if-else statement with a ternary operator.

Now, let's think about how the values in each row and column are related to each other. We know that the number written in the square (i, j) is equal to a_i + b_j. This means that the sum of the values in each row and column must be equal to the sum of the values in the corresponding row and column.

1. We are given a positive integer N.
2. We need to find the integer between 1 and N (inclusive) that can be divisible by 2 for the most number of times.
3. The number of times an integer can be divisible by 2 is how many times the integer can be divided by 2 without remainder.
4. The solution is always unique.

Let's start with the first integer, 1. It can be divided by 2 without remainder, so it can be divisible by 2 once.

Let's move on to the second integer, 2. It can be divided by 2 without remainder, so it can be divisible by 2 twice.

Let's move on to the third integer, 3. It cannot be divided by 2 without remainder, so it can be divisible by 2 zero times.

Let's move on to the fourth integer, 4. It can be divided by 2 without remainder, so it can be divisible by 2 twice.

Let's move on to the fifth integer, 5. It cannot be divided by 2 without remainder, so it can be divisible by 2 zero times.

1. We know that A, B, and C are standing along a number line.
2. We also know that the distance between A and B is at most d meters.
3. We also know that the distance between B and C is at most d meters.
4. We need to determine if A and C can communicate, either directly or indirectly.

Let's start with the direct communication.

1. If A and C are standing at a distance of less than or equal to d meters from each other, then they can communicate directly.
2. If A and C are standing at a distance greater than d meters from each other, then they cannot communicate directly.

Now, let's think about indirect communication.

1. If A and B are standing at a distance of less than or equal to d meters from each other, and B and C are standing at a distance of less than or equal to d meters from each other, then A and C can communicate indirectly.
2. If A and B are standing at a distance greater than d meters from each other, or if B and C are standing at a distance greater than d meters from each other, then A and C cannot communicate indirectly.

Now, let's use a hash table to store the distances between each pair of coordinates. This will help us quickly determine if two coordinates are within the communication range.

1. First, we need to split the input string into three words.
2. Then, we need to uppercase the initial letters of each word using the upper() method.
3. Finally, we need to concatenate the uppercased letters to form the acronym.

Let's write the code in Python:

s = input()
s_1, s_2, s_3 = s.split()

acronym = ""
for word in [s_1, s_2, s_3]:
    acronym += word[0].upper()

print(acronym)

In this code, we first take the input string and split it into three words using the split() method with a regular expression.
Then, we iterate over the three words and uppercase the initial letter of each word using the upper() method.
Finally, we concatenate the uppercased letters to form the acronym using the join() method.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of words in the input string. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use constant amount of memory to store the acronym.

1. Takahashi has two coins, A-yen and B-yen coins.
2. He wants to buy a toy that costs C yen.
3. He lives in Takahashi Kingdom, and may have coins that do not exist in Japan.

We need to check if Takahashi can buy the toy.

Let's consider the following cases:

Case 1: Takahashi has A-yen and B-yen coins.

If Takahashi has A-yen and B-yen coins, he can buy the toy.

Case 2: Takahashi has A-yen and not B-yen coins.

If Takahashi has A-yen and not B-yen coins, he cannot buy the toy.

Case 3: Takahashi has B-yen and not A-yen coins.

If Takahashi has B-yen and not A-yen coins, he cannot buy the toy.

Case 4: Takahashi has neither A-yen nor B-yen coins.

If Takahashi has neither A-yen nor B-yen coins, he cannot buy the toy.

In conclusion, we can use a hash table or a binary search tree to store the coins and their values, which can reduce the time complexity of the program.

1. We have N cards, each with an integer written on it.
2. We need to select one or more cards from these N cards, so that the average of the integers written on the selected cards is exactly A.
3. We need to find the number of ways to select cards such that the average is 8.

Let's start with the brute force approach. We can try all possible combinations of selecting cards and calculate the average of the selected cards. If the average is 8, we will count it as a valid selection.

However, this approach will be very time-consuming, especially when N is large. We need a more efficient approach.

Let's think about the problem in a different way. We can start by selecting one card. There are N cards to choose from, so there are N ways to select one card.

Now, we need to select the second card. We can choose any card from the remaining N-1 cards. There are N-1 ways to select the second card.

We continue this process by selecting the third card, the fourth card, and so on. We can choose any card from the remaining N-2 cards for the third card, and any card from the remaining N-3 cards for the fourth card, and so on.

We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We can use a 2D array to store the results of the previous calculations, so that we can reuse the results of previous calculations.

3. Using the i-th move decreases the monster's health by A_i.
4. There is no other way to decrease the monster's health.
5. Raccoon wins when the monster's health becomes 0 or below.

We need to find out whether Raccoon can win without using the same move twice or more.

Let's consider the following cases:

1. If Raccoon uses the same move twice or more, the monster's health will not become 0 or below.
2. If Raccoon uses different moves, the monster's health will become 0 or below.

So, we need to find out whether there is a way to use different moves to make the monster's health become 0 or below.

Let's consider the following example:

H = 10
N = 3
A_1 = 4
A_2 = 5
A_3 = 6

In this case, Raccoon can use the first move to make the monster's health become 6, then use the second move to make the monster's health become 1, and then use the third move to make the monster's health become 0 or below.

Therefore, Raccoon can win

Let's start by finding the longest even string that can be obtained by deleting one or more characters from the end of S.

We can start by removing the last character of S and check if the resulting string is even. If it is, we can remove the last character again and check if the resulting string is even. We can continue this process until we find a non-even string.

If we find a non-even string, we can remove the last character of the string and check if the resulting string is even. We can continue this process until we find a non-even string.

If we find a non-even string, we can remove the last character of the string and check if the resulting string is even. We can continue this process until we find a non-even string.

First, we need to define the function $f(l, r) = \sum\limits_{l \le i \le r} a_i \cdot b_i$.

The function $f(l, r)$ calculates the sum of the products of the elements of $a$ and $b$ from the $l$-th element to the $r$-th element.

Next, we need to reorder the elements of $b$.

We can reorder the elements of $b$ in any order we want.

Let's choose an arbitrary order of elements.

We can choose the first element of $b$ to be any element of $b$.

Let's choose the first element of $b$ to be the element with the smallest value.

We can choose the second element of $b$ to be any element of $b$ that is not the first element.

Let's choose the second element of $b$ to be the element with the second smallest value.

We can continue this process until we have reordered all the elements of $b$.

Now, we need to calculate the minimum possible value of $\sum\limits_{1 \le l \le r \le n} f(l, r)$.

We can do this by calculating the sum of the products of the elements of $a$ and $b$ for each possible range of elements.

We can use the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm

2. We need to find the minimum cost of buying $k$ shovels using the special offers.
3. We need to find the minimum cost of buying $k$ shovels without using any special offers.

Let's start with the third step.

We can buy $k$ shovels without using any special offers by buying the cheapest $k$ shovels. The cost of buying the cheapest $k$ shovels is $k \times a_i$, where $a_i$ is the cost of the $i$-th shovel.

So, the minimum cost of buying $k$ shovels without using any special offers is $k \times a_i$.

Now, let's move to the second step.

We need to find the minimum cost of buying $k$ shovels using the special offers.

We can use the special offers to buy $x_i$ shovels during one purchase. If we buy $x_i$ shovels during one purchase, we can get $y_i$ most cheapest shovels for free. The cost of buying $x_i$ shovels during one purchase is $x_i \times a_i$.

The total cost of buying $k$ shovels using the special offers is

4. Note that we are not allowed to add loops and multiple edges.

Let's start by analyzing the problem. We need to find the shortest path from vertex $1$ to any other vertex. We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.

Let's consider the tree corresponding to the first example. We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from vertex $1$ to vertex $5$. The shortest path is $[(1, 5)]$. We can add the edge $(1, 6)$ to make the shortest path from vertex $1$ to vertex $6$. The shortest path from vertex $1$ to any other vertex is at most $2$.

Let's consider the tree corresponding to the second example. We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from vertex $1$ to vertex $7$. The shortest path is $[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (

4. We can play some cards in some sequence (we choose the cards and the exact order they are played).
5. We can use an artifact that boosts the damage of some of our actions: every $10$-th card we play deals double damage.

Let's start with the first turn. We can play all three cards in any order and deal $18$ damage.

Let's move on to the second turn. We can play both cards and deal $7$ damage.

Let's move on to the third turn. We can play the first and the third card and deal $13$ damage.

Let's move on to the fifth turn. We can play the only card, which will deal double damage.

Now, let's optimize the order in which we play the cards to maximize our damage. We can play the card with the highest damage first, followed by the card with the second-highest damage, and so on. This can help us maximize our damage in the first turn.

There are two types of queries:   $1~ pos~ c$ ($1 \le pos \le |s|$, $c$ is lowercase Latin letter): replace $s_{pos}$ with $c$ (set $s_{pos} := c$);  $2~ l~ r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le |s|$): calculate the number of distinct characters in the substring $s[l; r]$. 

We need to find the number of distinct characters in the substring $s[l; r]$.

Let's start with the first query. We need to replace $s_{pos}$ with $c$. We can do this by replacing the character at position $pos$ with $c$.

Now, let's move on to the second query. We need to calculate the number of distinct characters in the substring $s[l; r]$. We can do this by counting the number of distinct characters in the substring $s[l; r]$.

We can use a hash table to keep track of the distinct characters in the substring $s[l; r]$. This can be done by initializing the hash table with the characters in the substring $s[1; r]$ and then updating the hash table as we process each query.

Let's define $p_i(n)$ as the following permutation: $[i, 1, 2, \dots, i - 1, i + 1, \dots, n]$. This means that the $i$-th permutation is almost identity (i.e. which maps every element to itself) permutation but the element $i$ is on the first position.

2. Then, we need to remove the minimum number of segments so that there are no bad points.
3. Finally, we need to print the indices of the segments we remove in any order.

Let's start with step 1. We can use a hash table to keep track of the segments that cover each integer point. We can initialize the hash table with all the segments. Then, we can iterate through each segment and check if it covers any bad points. If it does, we can remove the segment from the hash table.

Let's move on to step 2. We can use a greedy algorithm to remove the minimum number of segments. We can start by removing the segment with the highest end point. If the end point is covered by more than k segments, we can remove it. We can repeat this process until there are no more bad points.

Let's move on to step 3. We can print the indices of the segments we remove in any order. We can use a stack to keep track of the segments we remove. We can push the indices of the segments onto the stack in the order we remove them.

Here is the updated approach:

1. We are given two huge binary integer numbers $a$ and $b$ of lengths $n$ and $m$ respectively.
2. We will repeat the following process: if $b > 0$, then add to the answer the value $a~ \&~ b$ and divide $b$ by $2$ rounding down (i.e. remove the last digit of $b$), and repeat the process again, otherwise stop the process.
3. The value $a~ \&~ b$ means bitwise AND of $a$ and $b$.
4. Our task is to calculate the answer modulo $998244353$.
5. We should add the value $a~ \&~ b$ to the answer in decimal notation, not in binary.
6. For example, if $a = 1010_2~ (10_{10})$ and $b = 1000_2~ (8_{10})$, then the value $a~ \&~ b$ will be equal to $8$, not to $1000$.

2. We want to construct the array $a$ of length $n$ such that:
The first $\frac{n}{2}$ elements of $a$ are even (divisible by $2$);
The second $\frac{n}{2}$ elements of $a$ are odd (not divisible by $2);
All elements of $a$ are distinct and positive;
The sum of the first half equals to the sum of the second half ($\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\frac{n}{2}} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=\frac{n}{2} + 1}^{n} a_i$).

If there are multiple answers, we can print any. It is not guaranteed that the answer exists.

First, we need to find the number of minutes in a day. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 x 24 = 1440 minutes in a day.

Now, we need to find the number of minutes before the New Year. We know that the New Year comes when the clock shows 0 hours and 0 minutes. So, we need to find the number of minutes between the current time and the New Year.

Let's say the current time is $h$ hours and $m$ minutes. We need to find the number of minutes between the current time and the New Year. We can do this by subtracting the number of minutes in the current time from the number of minutes in a day.

Let's calculate the number of minutes in the current time:

$h$ hours x 60 minutes/hour = $h$ x 60 = $hm$

Now, let's calculate the number of minutes in a day:

1440 minutes/day

Now, let's subtract the number of minutes in the current time from the number of minutes in a day:

1440 minutes/day - $hm$

This gives us the number of minutes before the New Year.

Now, let's use the modulo operator to calculate the number of minutes before the New Year. We can do this by taking the result of the previous calculation and subtract

1. The first team should have the same size as the second team.
2. The first team should have unique skills.
3. The second team should have the same skills.

We can start by finding the maximum size of the first team. We can do this by finding the maximum number of unique skills among all the students.

Let's call the maximum number of unique skills "x". We can find x by using a set to keep track of the unique skills. We can iterate through the array of skills and add each skill to the set if it is not already present. If the skill is already present, we can skip it.

Once we have found the maximum number of unique skills, we can find the maximum size of the first team by dividing the number of students by the maximum number of unique skills.

We can then find the maximum size of the second team by dividing the number of students by the maximum number of unique skills.

We can then output the maximum size of the first team and the maximum size of the second team.

Here is some sample code in Python to solve the problem:
```
def get_max_team_size(students):

Let's fix a vertex $v$ as the root. We can calculate the cost of the tree by summing the distances between the vertex $v$ and all other vertices $i$ multiplied by the value of the vertex $i$.

The distance between the vertex $v$ and the vertex $i$ is the number of edges on the simple path between them.

3. Finally, we need to assign cookies to children based on their greed factors and cookie sizes.

Let's call the maximum greed factor of all children "g".
Let's call the maximum size of all cookies "s".

We can assign cookies to children based on the following rules:

* If a child's greed factor is less than or equal to the size of a cookie, we can assign the cookie to the child.
* If a child's greed factor is greater than the size of a cookie, we cannot assign the cookie to the child.

We can use a greedy algorithm to solve this problem. We start by assigning cookies to children in the order of their greed factors. We assign the cookie with the largest size to the child with the largest greed factor. We continue this process until we have assigned all cookies to children.

Let's call the number of children who are content "c".
We can calculate the maximum number of content children by using the following formula:

c = min(g, s)

This formula is based on the fact that the maximum number of content children is the minimum of the maximum greed factor and the maximum size of all cookies.

def hammingWeight(n):
    count = 0
    while n:
        count += n & 1
        n >>= 1
    return count

This function takes an unsigned integer as input and returns the number of '1' bits it has.

Note:

Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.

1. We have an array of digits representing a non-negative integer.
2. We need to add 1 to the integer.
3. The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contains a single digit.
4. We may assume that the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Now, let's solve the problem.

1. We start by looking at the last digit of the array. If it is less than 9, we can simply add 1 to it and return the array.
2. If the last digit is 9, we need to carry a 1 to the next digit. If there is no next digit, we need to add a new digit to the array.
3. We continue this process until we reach the first digit of the array. If the first digit is 9, we need to carry a 1 to the next digit. If there is no next digit, we need to add a new digit to the array.
4. If we reach the end of the array and still have a carry, we need to add a new digit to the array.

Here is the updated code:
```
def plusOne(digits):
    carry = 1
    for i in range(len(digits) - 1, -1, -1):
        if digits[i] + carry == 10:

4. How many such points are there?

We remind you that the distance between the origin and the point (p, q) can be represented as sqrt(p^2+q^2).

Let's start by finding the points that satisfy the condition.

1. We can start by finding the points that have a distance of less than or equal to D from the origin.
2. We can use the formula for the distance between a point and the origin (i.e., the distance between the point and the origin is equal to the distance between the point and the point (0,0)). This can simplify the calculation and make it more efficient.
3. We can then check if the distance is less than or equal to D.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

4. We can calculate f(X) by adding up the digits of X.
5. We can determine whether N is a Harshad number by checking if N is divisible by f(N).

Let's write a program to solve this problem.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int N;
    scanf("%d", &N);
    int sum = 0;
    while (N > 0) {
        sum += N % 10;

        printf("Yes\n");
    } else {
        printf("No\n");
    }
    return 0;
}

In this version, we use a while loop to iterate over the digits of N and calculate the sum of the digits. We then check if N is divisible by the sum of the digits. If it is, we print "Yes". Otherwise, we print "No".

4. We planned a trip along the axis.
5. In this plan, we first depart from the point with coordinate 0, then visit the N spots in the order they are numbered, and finally return to the point with coordinate 0.

Let's start with the first step. We can find the number of black stones and white stones on the board by counting the number of B's and W's in the string S.

Let's assume that the string S is "BBBWW".

The number of black stones is 3, and the number of white stones is 2.

Let's use a sliding window approach to find the number of black stones and white stones between the two ends of the row of stones. We can use two pointers, one pointing to the left end of the row of stones and the other pointing to the right end of the row of stones. We can then increment the number of black stones and white stones between the two pointers as we move the pointers towards the middle of the row.

Let's assume that the string S is "BBBWW".

2. Then, we need to check whether the concatenation is a square number.

Let's start with the first step.

We need to find the concatenation of a and b in this order.

We can do this by concatenating the two integers together.

For example, if a = 1 and b = 21, we can concatenate them as follows:

121

Now, we need to check whether the concatenation is a square number.

We can do this by using a modular exponentiation algorithm to check whether the concatenation is a square number.

For example, if we use the modular exponentiation algorithm to check whether 121 is a square number, we can find that it is not a square number.

Therefore, the concatenation of a and b in this order is not a square number.

Therefore, the output is No.

3. After these operations, we select an integer X and count the number of i such that a_i=X.
4. We want to maximize this count by making optimal choices.

Let's start with the first operation. We can add 1 to a_i, subtract 1 from a_i, or do nothing.

If we add 1 to a_i, we get a_i+1. If we subtract 1 from a_i, we get a_i-1. If we do nothing, we get a_i.

Now, let's think about the second operation. We can add 1 to a_i, subtract 1 from a_i, or do nothing.

If we add 1 to a_i, we get a_i+1. If we subtract 1 from a_i, we get a_i-1. If we do nothing, we get a_i.

1. We have a canvas divided into a grid with H rows and W columns.
2. The square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left is represented as (i, j).
3. Initially, all the squares are white.
4. square1001 wants to draw a picture with black paint.
5. His specific objective is to make Square (i, j) black when s_{i, j}= #, and to make Square (i, j) white when s_{i, j}=..
6. However, since he is not a good painter, he can only choose two squares that are horizontally or vertically adjacent and paint those squares black, for some number of times (possibly zero).
7. He may choose squares that are already painted black, in which case the color of those squares remain black.

Now, let's think about the problem.

1. We know that the balance scale tips to the left if the total weight of the masses on the left pan is greater than the total weight of the masses on the right pan.
2. We also know that the balance scale balances if the total weight of the masses on the left pan is equal to the total weight of the masses on the right pan.
3. Finally, the balance scale tips to the right if the total weight of the masses on the left pan is less than the total weight of the masses on the right pan.

Now, let's apply this to the problem.

1. Takahashi placed a mass of weight A and a mass of weight B on the left pan of a balance scale.
2. He placed a mass of weight C and a mass of weight D on the right pan.

We need to find the total weight of the masses on the left pan and the total weight of the masses on the right pan.

The total weight of the masses on the left pan is A + B + C + D.
The total weight of the masses on the right pan is C + D.

Now, we need to compare these two values.

If A + B + C + D > C + D, we know that the balance scale tips to the left.
If A + B + C + D = C + D, we know that the balance scale balances.
If A + B + C + D < C + D, we know that the balance

5. We need to find the maximum possible profit of Joisino's shop.

Let's start by considering the first shop. We know that Joisino's shop is open during at least one period. Let's call this period P. If Joisino's shop is open during period P, then the profit will be P_{1,P}.

Now, let's consider the second shop. We know that Joisino's shop is open during at least one period. Let's call this period Q. If Joisino's shop is open during period Q, then the profit will be P_{2,Q}.

We can continue this process for all N shops. Let's call the maximum possible profit of Joisino's shop P.

We know that P is the maximum possible profit because we are given that the profit of each shop is between -10^7 and 10^7. This means that the profit of Joisino's shop can be at most 10^7.

We can also see that P is the maximum possible profit because we are given that the profit of each shop is an integer. This means that the profit of Jo

2. The second rectangle covers the vertical range of [1,2] and the horizontal range of [b,b+W].
3. We need to move the second rectangle horizontally so that it connects with the first rectangle.

Let's denote the horizontal position of the first rectangle as x1 and the horizontal position of the second rectangle as x2.

We need to find the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved.

Let's consider the following cases:

1. x2 < x1: In this case, we need to move the second rectangle to the right by a distance of x1 - x2.
2. x2 > x1: In this case, we need to move the second rectangle to the left by a distance of x2 - x1.

We can see that the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved is x2 - x1.

Therefore, the solution is:

We need to find out how many grams of sand will the upper bulb contain after t seconds.

Let's start with the first step. The sandglass runs for X seconds.

We know that the sandglass runs for X seconds, so we can say that the sand in the upper bulb will be consumed at a rate of 1 gram per second.

2. Then, we need to compute the product of the given integers.

4. We are also given that A is an integer between 0 and 1000 (inclusive).
5. We need to print Yes if he can pay exactly N yen using only his 1-yen and 500-yen coins, and print No otherwise.

Let's start by considering the case where N is a multiple of 500. In this case, we can use infinitely many 500-yen coins to pay N yen.

Now, let's consider the case where N is not a multiple of 500. In this case, we can use the 1-yen coins to make up the difference.

For example, if N = 2018, we can use four 500-yen coins and one 1-yen coin to pay 2018 yen.

So, we can conclude that E869120 can pay exactly N yen using only his 1-yen and 500-yen coins if and only if N is a multiple of

2. He ate it B days after he bought it.
3. He never gets a stomachache from eating something whose "best-by" date is at most X days earlier.
4. He gets a stomachache if the "best-by" date of the food is X+1 or more days earlier, though.

We can see that Takahashi ate the food B days after he bought it. If B is less than or equal to X, he did not get a stomachache. If B is greater than X, he got a stomachache.

So, we can write a program that outputs "safe" if B is less than or equal to X, "dangerous" if B is greater than X, and "delicious" if B is equal to X.

Here is the updated program:

# Input
X = int(input())
A = int(input())

# Calculate the number of days between the "best-by" date and the date of purchase

Let's denote the number of votes obtained by Takahashi as T and the number of votes obtained by Aoki as A.

We can write the ratio of the number of votes obtained by Takahashi and Aoki at the i-th time as T_i:A_i.

We can also write the ratio of the number of votes obtained by Takahashi and Aoki at the N-th time as T_N:A_N.

We know that the ratio of the number of votes obtained by Takahashi and Aoki at the i-th time is always coprime with the ratio of the number of votes obtained by Takahashi and Aoki at the (i+1)-th time.

We can use this fact to find the minimum possible total number of votes obtained by Takahashi and Aoki when AtCoDeer checked the report for the N-th time.

Let's look at the input:

4 3
1 2

We can see that city 1 appears twice in the input. Therefore, city 1 is connected to 2 roads.

Let's look at the input:

We can see that city 2 appears twice in the input. Therefore, city 2 is connected to 2 roads.

Now, let's use a hash table to keep track of the number of roads connected to each city. We can create a hash table with N keys, where each key represents a city. We can set the value of each key to 0 initially, and then increment the value for each city that appears in the input.

Let's consider the following cases:

First, we need to find the minimum fee when you park for N hours.

Let's consider two cases:

Case 1: You choose Plan 1.

In this case, the fee will be A×T yen, where T is the number of hours you park.

So, the minimum fee will be A×T yen, where T is the minimum number of hours you can park.

Let's find the minimum number of hours you can park.

The minimum number of hours you can park is 1 hour, because you can park for 1 hour and the fee will be A×1=A yen.

The minimum number of hours you can park is 2 hours, because you can park for 2 hours and the fee will be A×2=2A yen.

The minimum number of hours you can park is 3 hours, because you can park for 3 hours and the fee will be A×3=3A yen.

...

The minimum number of hours you can park is 20 hours, because you can park for 20 hours and the fee will be A×20=20A yen.

Case 2: You choose Plan 2.

In this case, the fee will be B yen, regardless of the duration.

So, the minimum fee will be B yen.

Now, let's calculate the expected value of the total execution time of the code.

Let's denote the number of attempts it takes for the code to correctly solve all the cases as X.

The probability that the code fails to correctly solve some of the M cases in the first attempt is 1/2.

The probability that the code fails to correctly solve some of the M cases in the second attempt is 1/4.

The probability that the code fails to correctly solve some of the M cases in the third attempt is 1/8.

The code works as follows:

1. We prompt the user to input a string.
2. We create an empty set to keep track of the letters that have been found in the string.
3. We create a variable to keep track of the smallest letter that does not occur in the string.
4. We use a for loop to iterate through all the letters in the range of 97 to 123 (which corresponds to the lowercase letters of the alphabet).

1. We are given N numbers X_1, X_2,..., X_N, where N is an even number.
2. For each i = 1, 2,..., N, let the median of X_1, X_2,..., X_N excluding X_i, that is, the median of X_1, X_2,..., X_{i-1}, X_{i+1},..., X_N be B_i.
3. Find B_i for each i = 1, 2,..., N.

Now, let's solve the problem.

1. We can find the median of X_1, X_2,..., X_N excluding X_i by finding the median of X_1, X_2,..., X_{i-1}, X_{i+1},..., X_N.
2. We can find the median of X_1, X_2,..., X_{i-1}, X_{i+1},..., X_N by finding the median of X_1, X_2,..., X_{i-1}, X_{i+1},..., X_N.

1. We have N sticks with negligible thickness.
2. The length of the i-th stick is A_i.
3. Snuke wants to select four different sticks from these sticks and form a rectangle (including a square), using the sticks as its sides.
4. Find the maximum possible area of the rectangle.

Let's consider the following cases:

1. The four sticks are the same length.
2. The two sticks that are the longest are the same length.
3. The two sticks that are the longest are different lengths.

We need to find the maximum possible area of the rectangle.

Let's consider the following cases:

1. The four sticks are the same length.

In this case, we can form a square with the four sticks. The area of the square is the product of the length of the four sticks.

2. The two sticks that are the longest are the same length.

In this case, we can form a rectangle with the two sticks that are the longest and the two sticks that are the shortest. The area of the rectangle is the product of the length of the two sticks that are the longest and the length of the two sticks that are the shortest.

3. The two sticks that are the longest are different lengths.

In this case, we can form a rectangle with the two sticks that are the

2. Each participant eats one chocolate piece on each of the following days in the camp: the 1-st day, the (A_i + 1)-th day, the (2A_i + 1)-th day, and so on.
3. We also know that there were X chocolate pieces remaining at the end of the camp.
4. During the camp, nobody except the participants ate chocolate pieces.

Now, let's try to find the number of chocolate pieces prepared at the beginning of the camp.

We can start by calculating the total number of chocolate pieces eaten by all participants during the camp.

1. The first participant eats one chocolate piece on Day 1, 3, 5, and 7, for a total of 4 chocolate pieces.
2. The second participant eats one chocolate piece on Day 1 and 6, for a total of 2 chocolate pieces.
3. The third participant eats one chocolate piece only, for a total of 1 chocolate piece.

Therefore, the total number of chocolate pieces eaten by all participants during the camp is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 chocolate pieces.

First, we need to find the number of ways to select coins. We can use the formula:

ways = (A + B + C)! / (A! \* B! \* C!)

where A, B, and C are the number of 500-yen, 100-yen, and 50-yen coins, respectively.

Next, we need to find the number of ways to select coins when we have a constraint that the total amount of coins is X yen. We can use the formula:

ways = (A + B + C)! / (A! \* B! \* C!) \* (X - A - B - C)! / (X! - A! - B! - C!)

where X is the total amount of coins, and A, B, and C are the number of 500-yen, 100-yen, and 50-yen coins, respectively.

Finally, we need to find the number of ways to select coins when we have a constraint that the total amount of coins is X yen and the number of coins of each denomination is a multiple of 50. We can use the formula:

1. First, we need to count the number of unique items you got.
2. We can use a set to keep track of the items you got.
3. For each item, we can check if it's already in the set. If it's not, we add it to the set and increment the count.
4. After we've processed all the items, we can print the count.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. How do we keep track of the items we've seen?

We can use a set to keep track of the items we've seen. A set is a data structure that allows us to store unique items.

2. How do we check if an item is already in the set?

We can use the `in` operator to check if an item is already in the set. If it's not, we add it to the set and increment the count.

3. How do we increment the count?

We can use the `+=` operator to increment the count.

Here's the code:
```
# Initialize the set and the count
items = set()
count = 0

# Read the input
for item in input():
    # Check if the item is already in the set
    if item not in items:
        # Add the item to the set and increment the count
        items.add(item)
        count += 1

2. The second user has a rating between 2000 and 2399, so it is "yellow".
3. The third user has a rating between 2400 and 2799, so it is "orange".
4. The fourth user has a rating between 2400 and 2799, so it is "orange".

The minimum number of different colors is 2, because there are two different colors: "blue" and "orange".

The maximum number of different colors is 2, because there are two different colors: "blue" and "orange".

So, the output is 2 2.

4. Similarly, the second and third characters in S mean the presence or absence of sliced pork and green onions on top of the ramen.
5. Write a program that, when S is given, prints the price of the corresponding bowl of ramen.

Let's start with the first character in S. If it is o, then the ramen should be topped with boiled egg, so we need to add 100 yen to the price of the ramen. If it is x, then the ramen should not be topped with boiled egg, so we don't need to add anything to the price of the ramen.

Let's move on to the second character in S. If it is o, then the ramen should be topped with sliced pork, so we need to add 100 yen to the price of the ramen. If it is x, then the ramen should not be topped with sliced pork,

Let's assume that AtCoDeer is honest. Then, if TopCoDeer is honest, AtCoDeer will say that TopCoDeer is honest. If TopCoDeer is dishonest, AtCoDeer will say that TopCoDeer is dishonest.

So, we can conclude that if AtCoDeer says that TopCoDeer is honest, then TopCoDeer must be honest. And if AtCoDeer says that TopCoDeer is dishonest, then TopCoDeer must be dishonest.

Therefore, we can conclude that TopCoDeer is honest if AtCoDeer says that TopCoDeer is honest, and TopCoDeer is dishonest if AtCoDeer says that TopCoDeer is dishonest.

We need to replace each of the symbols op1, op2, and op3 with + or - so that the formula holds.

We can start by replacing A with +.

The formula becomes +B op2 C op3 D = 7.

We can replace B with -.

The formula becomes +- op2 C op3 D = 7.

We can replace op2 with +.

The formula becomes ++ C op3 D = 7.

We can replace C with -.

The formula becomes ++ - op3 D = 7.

We can replace op3 with +.

The formula becomes ++ + D = 7.

We can replace D with -.

The formula becomes ++ + - = 7.

2. The kangaroo's nest is at coordinate X, and he wants to travel to coordinate X as fast as possible.
3. The earliest possible time for the kangaroo to reach coordinate X is the earliest time when he reaches the nest.

Let's denote the kangaroo's position at time t as x(t).

We know that x(t) = x(t-1) + i, where i is the jump length.

We also know that x(t) = X, which means that we want to find the earliest time t such that x(t) = X.

We can write a recurrence relation for x(t) as follows:

x(t) = x(t-1) + i
x(t) = X

We can solve this recurrence relation by setting x(t) = X - i(t-1) and then solving for t.

x(t) = X - i(t-1)
x(t) = X

x(t) - X = -i(t-1)

We can see that the difference between x(t) and X is equal to -i(t-1).

Therefore, the earliest time t such that x(t) = X is when x

1. Use an array to store the digits of the number.
2. Use a hash table to keep track of the number of consecutive same digits.
3. Iterate through the array and check if the current digit is the same as the previous digit. If it is, increment the number of consecutive same digits. If it's not, reset the number of consecutive same digits to 0.
4. If the number of consecutive same digits is three or more, print Yes. If it's less than three, print No.

This approach is more efficient than using a loop to iterate through each digit, as it avoids the overhead of repeatedly checking each digit. Additionally, using a hash table to keep track of the number of consecutive same digits allows you to check if the number is good in O(1) time complexity, which is much faster than O(n) time complexity for a loop.

1. We know that the string s consists of uppercase English letters.
2. We also know that there exists a substring of s that starts with A and ends with Z.
3. We want to find the greatest length of the string Snuke can construct.

Let's start by finding the length of the substring that starts with A and ends with Z. We can do this by finding the first occurrence of A and the last occurrence of Z in the string s.

Let's call the first occurrence of A "start" and the last occurrence of Z "end". We can then find the length of the substring by subtracting "start" from "end".

Now, we need to find the greatest length of the string Snuke can construct. We can do this by finding the maximum length of the substring that starts with A and ends with Z.

Let's call this maximum length "max_length". We can then print "max_length" as the answer.

So, the new solution is:

1. Find the first occurrence of A in the string s.
2. Find the last occurrence of Z in the string s.
3. Subtract the first occurrence of A from the last occurrence of Z to find the length of the substring that starts with A and ends with Z.
4. Find the maximum length of the substring that starts with A and ends with Z.
5. Print the maximum length as the answer.

So, we need to find the number of problems on which he received an AC once or more.

We can do this by keeping track of the number of ACs received for each problem.

Let's say we have a hash table to map each problem to the number of ACs received for that problem.

If Takahashi received an AC for the first time on a problem, we can add 1 to the corresponding element in the hash table.

If Takahashi received an AC for the second time on a problem, we can add 1 to the corresponding element in the hash table.

If Takahashi received a WA for the first time on a problem, we can add 1 to the corresponding element in the hash table.

If Takahashi received a WA for the second time on a problem, we can add 1 to the corresponding element in the hash table.

Once we have the hash table,

1. Fennec can use Special Move at most K times.
2. Fennec needs to do Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning.
3. The health of the i-th monster is H_i.

We can start by considering the case where K = 0. In this case, Fennec can only use Attack, and the minimum number of times she needs to do it is 1.

Now, let's consider the case where K > 0. In this case, Fennec can use Special Move at most K times. We can assume that she uses it at most K - 1 times.

Now, let's consider the case where K - 1 = 0. In this case, Fennec can only use Attack, and the minimum number of times she needs to do it is 1.

Now, let's consider the case where K - 1 > 0. In this case, Fennec can use Special Move at most K - 1 times. We can assume that she uses it at most K - 2 times.

Now, let's consider the case where K - 2 = 0. In this case, Fennec can only use Attack, and the minimum number of times she needs to do it is 1.

Now, let's consider the case where K - 2 > 0. In this case, Fennec can use Special Move

3. Each robot is placed at coordinates (x_i, i) for type A and (K - x_i, i) for type B.
4. When activated, each type of robot will operate as follows:
	* When a type-A robot is activated at coordinates (x_i, i), it will move to the position of the ball on the line y = i, collect the ball, move back to its original position (x_i, i) and deactivate itself. If there is no such ball, it will just deactivate itself without doing anything.
	* When a type-B robot is activated at coordinates (K - x_i, i), it will move to the position of the ball on the line y = i, collect the ball, move back to its original position (K - x_i, i) and deactivate itself. If there is no such ball, it will just deactivate itself without doing anything.
5. Snuke will activate some of the 2N robots to collect all of the balls.

2. The bus fare will be C yen if you buy ordinary tickets along the way, and D yen if you buy an unlimited ticket.
3. Find the minimum total fare when the optimal choices are made for trains and buses.

Let's start with the train fare.

The optimal choice for trains is to buy an unlimited ticket for 300 yen.

The optimal choice for buses is to buy ordinary tickets for 220 yen.

The minimum total fare is 300 + 220 = 520 yen.

First, we need to understand the problem.

The problem is asking us to find the number of possible orders in which the people were standing.

The people were standing in a row yesterday, but now they are unsure of the order in which they were standing.

However, each person remembered the following fact: the absolute difference of the number of the people who were standing to the left of that person, and the number of the people who were standing to the right of that person.

According to their reports, the difference above for person i is A_i.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the number of possible orders.

We can start by considering the first person.

We know that the number of people who were standing to the left of the first person is A_1.

We also know that the number of people who were standing to the right of the first person is N - A_1 - 1.

Now, let's consider the second person.

We know that the number of people who were standing to the left of the second person is A_2.

We also know that the number of people who were standing to the right of the second person is N - A_2 - 1.

We can continue this process for each person, considering the number of people who were standing to the left and right of each person.

We can use this information to find the number of possible orders in

3. We can find the sum of the integers between 1 and N (inclusive) by adding the numbers from 1 to N.
4. We can find the sum of the integers between 1 and N (inclusive) whose sum of digits written in base 10 is between A and B (inclusive) by finding the numbers whose sum of digits written in base 10 is between A and B (inclusive) and adding them.

2. Find the sum of the numbers whose sum of digits written in base 10 is between A and B (inclusive).

Now, let's solve the first part.

1. We can use a mathematical formula to directly calculate the sum of digits of a number in a given base. For example, in base 10, the sum of digits of a number can be calculated as the number itself, since the digits of a number in base 10 are the same as the digits of the number in

1. We know that the abbreviation for the N-th round of ABC is ABC followed by a three-digit number.
2. We also know that the three-digit number is the N-th round of ABC.
3. So, we need to find the three-digit number that corresponds to the N-th round of ABC.
4. We can do this by adding 100 to N.
5. For example, if N is 100, then the three-digit number is 200 (100 + 100).
6. If N is 101, then the three-digit number is 201 (101 + 100).
7. And so on.

So, the program should output the abbreviation for the N-th round of ABC, which is ABC followed by the three-digit number that corresponds to the N-th round of ABC.

Here's the corrected code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N;
    cin >> N;
    string round = "ABC" + to_string(N + 100);

2. We can use the `range` function to generate a list of all the days between 2018-1-1 and 2018-a-b.
3. For each day in the list, we need to check if it is a Takahashi day.
4. A Takahashi day is a day where the month and the day are equal as numbers.
5. We can use the `datetime` module to convert the input strings to datetime objects, which will make it easier to compare the month and day of the date.

Here is the updated code:

```
import datetime

a, b = input().split()

for day in range(datetime.date(2018, 1, 1), datetime.date(2018, int(a), int(b))):
    if day.month == day.day:
        print(day)
```

This code uses the `range` function to generate a list of all the days between 2018-1-1 and 2018-a-b, and then checks each day in the list to see if it is a Takahashi day. If it is, it prints the day.

Let's think about the fourth step. We need to find the maximum number of balls that can be rewritten in a way that satisfies the constraint.

To find the maximum number of balls that can be rewritten, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by considering the first ball. We can rewrite the integer on this ball to any integer between 1 and K, without violating the constraint.

Next, we consider the second ball. We can rewrite the integer on this ball to any integer between 1 and K, without violating the constraint.

We continue this process for all N balls, considering each ball in turn. We can rewrite the integer on each ball to any integer between 1 and K, without violating the constraint.

Let's consider the example given in the statement.

A = 5, B = 7, C = 5

In this case, A and C are the same, but B is different.

So, we need to find the integer that is different from the rest.

The answer is B = 7.

Therefore, the solution is to find the integer that is different from the rest among the given three integers.

We can set the values of the hash table to 0, 0, and 0, respectively.

Now, we can iterate through the given integers and update the values of the hash table accordingly.

For example, if we encounter the integer 5, we can set the value of the key "A" to 1.

Let's start with the first train from Station i to Station i+1. We know that it will depart Station i S_i seconds after the ceremony begins.

Let's assume that we are at Station i when the ceremony begins. We want to find the earliest possible time we can reach Station N.

We know that the first train from Station i to Station i+1 will depart Station i S_i seconds after the ceremony begins. So, if we are at Station i when the ceremony begins, we can reach Station i+1 at time S_i.

4. We can then iterate through each participant and their weight, and for each participant, we can calculate the maximum number of teams that can be formed with the same total weight as the participant's weight.

Now, let's think about the problem. We need to find the number of floor on which Petya lives. We know that Petya's apartment number is $n$. We also know that the distribution of apartments is the following: the first floor contains $2$ apartments, every other floor contains $x$ apartments each.

Let's start from the first floor. The first floor contains $2$ apartments, so the number of apartments on the first floor is $2$. We also know that the number of apartments on the first floor is $n$. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2 + 2x = n

Now, let's solve for $x$. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by $2$ to get:

We know that we will spend m wrong tries to perform the combo and during the i-th try we will make a mistake right after p_i-th button (1 ≤ p_i < n). It is guaranteed that during the m+1-th try we press all buttons right and finally perform the combo.

First, we need to understand the problem. We have three friends, and they are going to meet each other. Each friend can change their position by 1 to the left or by 1 to the right. The total pairwise distance is the sum of distances between each pair of friends. The friends want to know the minimum total pairwise distance they can reach if they will move optimally.

Now, let's think about the solution. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We can create a 2D array dp[i][j] to store the minimum total pairwise distance if the first friend moves i times, and the second and third friends move j times.

We can use the following recurrence relation to calculate dp[i][j]:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1] + |a - b|, dp[i-1][j] + |a - c|, dp[i][j-1] + |b - c|)

where a, b, and c are the initial positions of the first, second, and third friends, respectively.

We can start from the initial positions of the friends, and then move them one by one. We can use a memoization technique to store the results of the dynamic programming algorithm in a hash table or a 2D array. This will help to avoid redundant calculations and improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Additionally, we can use a more

2. We need to check if there is a partition of the array into pairs that each element of the array belongs to exactly one pair.
3. We need to check if there is a partition of the array into pairs that the numbers in each pair are similar to each other.

Let's start with the third step.

We need to check if there is a partition of the array into pairs that the numbers in each pair are similar to each other.

We can use a bit vector to keep track of which numbers have already been paired with each other.

For each pair, we can check if the numbers in the pair are similar to each other.

If the numbers in the pair are similar to each other, we can set the corresponding bits in the bit vector to 1.

If we have set all the bits in the bit vector to 1, we can return true.

If we have not set all the bits in the bit vector to 1, we can return false.

Let's start with the second step.

We need to check if there is a partition of the array into pairs that each element of the array belongs to exactly one pair.

We can use a hash table to store the pairs of numbers.

First, we need to find the shortest path between each pair of districts. We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between each pair of districts.

Next, we need to find the minimum total cost of all the courier routes. We can use the shortest path we found earlier to calculate the total cost of each courier route.

Finally, we need to find the minimum total cost of all the courier routes after making at most one road cost zero. We can use the minimum total cost we found earlier and add the cost of the road we made zero.

So, the solution is to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between each pair of districts, and then use the shortest path to calculate the total cost of each courier route. Finally, we can find the minimum total cost of all the courier routes after making at most one road cost zero.

First, we need to understand the problem. The problem is to find the day when the book of the $i$-th child is returned back to him for the first time.

Let's consider the example. The book of the $1$-st kid will be passed to the following kids:  after the $1$-st day it will belong to the $5$-th kid,  after the $2$-nd day it will belong to the $3$-rd kid,  after the $3$-rd day it will belong to the $2$-nd kid,  after the $4$-th day it will belong to the $1$-st kid. 

So after the fourth day, the book of the first kid will return to its owner. The book of the fourth kid will return to him for the first time after exactly one day.

Now, let's think about the solution. We need to find the day when the book of each child is returned back to him for the first time. We can do it by keeping track of the day when the book of each child is passed to the $p_i$-th kid.

Let's use a hash table to store the information. We can use the $p_i$ as the key and the day as the value. For example, we can use the following hash table:

First, we need to find the nearest Christmas tree for each person. We can do this by finding the minimum distance between each person and each Christmas tree.

Let's denote the minimum distance between person $j$ and Christmas tree $i$ as $d_{ij}$. We can calculate $d_{ij}$ as follows:

$$d_{ij} = \min\limits_{i=1}^{n} |y_j - x_i|$$

Now, we need to find the sum of all $d_{ij}$ for all $j$. This is the value we need to minimize.

Let's denote the sum of all $d_{ij}$ as $S$. We can calculate $S$ as follows:

$$S = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{m} \min\limits_{i=1}^{n} |y_j - x_i|$$

Now, we need to find the minimum value of $S$. This is the answer to the problem.

Let's denote the minimum value of $S$ as $res$. We can calculate $res$ as follows:

$$res = \min\limits_{S} S$$

Finally, we can print the answer as follows:

4. The robot wants to do it with the minimum possible number of moves.
5. If there are several possible traversals, the robot wants to choose the lexicographically smallest path.

Let's start with the first package. The robot can move to the point $(1, 3)$ or $(3, 3)$. If the robot moves to $(1, 3)$, it will be at the point $(2, 3)$ after one move. If the robot moves to $(3, 3)$, it will be at the point $(3, 4)$ after one move.

Let's consider the second package. The robot can move to the point $(1, 2)$ or $(3, 3)$. If the robot moves to $(1, 2)$, it will be at the point $(2, 2)$ after one move. If the robot moves to $(3, 3)$, it will be at the point $(3, 4)$ after one move.

Let's continue this process for all $n$ packages. We will keep track of the coordinates of the packages and the robot's current position. We will also keep track of the minimum number of moves required to collect all the packages.

3. Our task is to find the minimum number of moves we need to perform in order to make the sum of digits of $n$ be less than or equal to $s$.

Let's consider the following example:

$n = 217871987498122$
$s = 10$

We need to find the minimum number of moves we need to perform in order to make the sum of digits of $n$ be less than or equal to $s$.

We can start by calculating the sum of digits of $n$ once and storing it in a variable:

$sum = 2 + 1 + 7 + 8 + 7 + 1 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 9 + 8 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 45$

Now, we can use a while loop to keep track of the number of moves needed to make the sum of digits of $n$ be less than or equal to $s$. We will start with $moves = 0$ and increase it by 1 for each move we make.

$moves = 0$

We will continue to make moves until the sum of digits of $n$

First, we need to determine the minimum time required to reach each floor from the first floor. We can do this by considering two cases:

Case 1: Using the stairs

If we use the stairs, we need to take the minimum time required to reach each floor from the first floor using the stairs. This can be done by summing up the corresponding values of $a_i$ for each floor.

Case 2: Using the elevator

If we use the elevator, we need to take the minimum time required to reach each floor from the first floor using the elevator. This can be done by summing up the corresponding values of $b_i$ for each floor.

Now, we need to determine the minimum total time required to reach each floor from the first floor. This can be done by considering the minimum time required to reach each floor using the stairs and the minimum time required to reach each floor using the elevator.

We can do this by taking the minimum of the two times.

Therefore, the solution is to print the minimum total time required to reach each floor from the first floor.

First, we need to find a permutation of length $n$ that contains every integer from $1$ to $n$ (inclusive) and, moreover, each number appears exactly once. We can do this by creating a list of numbers from $1$ to $n$ and then shuffling the list.

Next, we need to find a permutation $p$ in which absolute difference (that is, the absolute value of difference) of any two neighboring (adjacent) elements is between $2$ and $4$, inclusive. We can do this by iterating through the list of numbers and swapping adjacent elements if the absolute difference between them is not between $2$ and $4$.

Finally, we need to print any such permutation for the given integer $n$ or determine that it does not exist. We can do this by checking if the list of numbers is in a valid permutation format and if it meets the requirements.

Let's implement this in Python:

def is_good(arr):
    # Initialize a hash table to keep track of the parity of each index and element
    parity_table = {}

    # Loop through the array and calculate the parity of each index and element
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # Calculate the parity of the current index
        parity_table[i] = i % 2

        # Calculate the parity of the current element
        parity_table[arr[i]] = arr[i] % 2

    # Check if the parity of each index and element is the same
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if parity_table[i]!= parity_table[arr[i]]:
            return False

This code uses a hash table to keep track of the parity of each index and element. It then loops through the array and calculates the parity of each index and element simultaneously. Finally, it checks if the parity of each index and element is the same, and returns `True` if it is, and `False` if it is not.
