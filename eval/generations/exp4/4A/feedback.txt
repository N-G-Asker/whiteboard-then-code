  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to find the number of unique divisors in the list. Instead of sorting the list and then finding the number of distinct elements, you can use a hash table to keep track of the unique divisors. This will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from O(n log n) to O(n). Additionally, you can use a more efficient data structure to store the list of divisors, such as a linked list or an array, instead of a vector.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient data structure to store the dynamic programming table. Instead of using a 2D array, you can use a 1D array with a fixed size of $n \times k$, where $n$ is the length of the input string and $k$ is the size of the set.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider using dynamic programming to solve the problem. Dynamic programming involves breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems and solving each sub-problem only once, storing the solutions to sub-problems to avoid redundant computation. This can help to reduce the time and space complexity of the algorithm, making it more efficient for large inputs. Additionally, dynamic programming can help to avoid redundant calculations, which can be especially useful in this problem since the cost of each move depends on the length of the subsequence being added to the set.

Instead of considering all possible positions $i$ and checking if changing the type of the $i$-th bracket makes the resulting bracket sequence regular, you can use a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of regular bracket sequences for each position $i$. This can be done by creating a 2D array $dp$ where $dp[i][j]$ represents the number of regular bracket sequences of length $j$ that can be formed by changing the type of the $i$-th bracket.

  Your approach is correct, but you can improve it by using a more efficient algorithm to find the maximum possible length of the substring. One suggestion is to use a sliding window approach, where you maintain a window of size $k$ (where $k$ is the maximum possible length of the substring) and move the window left or right to find the maximum length of the substring that still makes $t$ a subsequence of $s$. This approach will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from $O(n^2)$ to $O(nk)$, where $n$ is the length of the string $s$.

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few areas where you can improve it. First, instead of dividing the array into two parts, you can use a more efficient algorithm called the "bucket sort" to sort the array in $O(n)$ time. This algorithm works by creating $k$ buckets, where each bucket contains all the elements in the array that are less than or equal to a specific value. You can then use a simple loop to iterate through the buckets and find the minimum number of operations required to obtain at least $k$ equal numbers in each bucket.

If a string is found that satisfies both requirements, the algorithm returns it. If no string is found, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different combination of letters. This approach ensures that all possible solutions are considered, and it can be implemented efficiently using a combination of dynamic programming and memoization.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the fact that the length of the parts of the two towers that are not covered with snow is equal to the height of the two towers minus the length of the parts of the two towers that are covered with snow. This means that the length of the parts of the two towers that are not covered with snow is equal to 1000 - (a + b). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

  Your approach is correct, but you can simplify the solution by noticing that the time when both Alice and Bob were holding down their buttons is the time difference between the time when Alice released her button B and the time when Bob released his button D. This time difference is t3 - t2 = t4 - t3 = 50 seconds. Therefore, you can skip the intermediate steps of finding the time when Alice released her button B and the time when Bob released his button D, and directly calculate the time when both Alice and Bob were holding down their buttons as t3 - t2 = 50 seconds.

  Your approach is good, but there is a small mistake in the last step. Instead of "The character he appends is not important," it should be "The character he appends is not relevant." The reason is that the length of T is equal to the length of S plus 1, and the character he appends does not affect the length of T. Therefore, it is not important to consider the character he appends.

  Your approach is good, but there is one small mistake. Instead of using the discounted price of the highest price item, you should use the regular price. The discounted price is half the regular price, so you should use p_i yen instead of p_i / 2 yen. This will give you the correct answer.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the time it takes to order the dishes. Since the restaurant can only order one dish at a time, it means that the time it takes to order the dishes will be the maximum time it takes to order each dish. Therefore, it is more efficient to order the dishes in the order APC Ramen, ATC Hanbagu, AGC Pasta, ARC Curry, ABC Don, as this will take the maximum time to order the dishes. This approach will also help to reduce the number of orders that need to be placed, which

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the sum of the inverses. Instead of using a loop to calculate the sum, you can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate it directly. This will reduce the time and space complexity of your algorithm.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more robust approach to checking if the input is uppercase or lowercase. The `isupper()` method only checks if the input is uppercase, and it may not work correctly for all inputs. Instead, you can use the `islower()` method to check if the input is lowercase. Additionally, you can use the `lower()` method to convert the input to lowercase, and then check if it is equal to "a". This will ensure that your program works correctly for all inputs, including those that are not uppercase or lowercase.

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few improvements that can be made. First, instead of finding the number of triples of X, Y, and Z that satisfy the condition X + Y + Z = 0, you can directly find the number of triples that satisfy the condition X + Y + Z = S. This can be done by subtracting the number of triples that satisfy the condition X + Y + Z = 0 from the total number of triples that satisfy the condition 0 ≤ X, Y, Z ≤ K.

  Your approach is good, but there is a small mistake in the third point. If A = 1 and B = 3, then they can take 2 pieces of cake each.

Here is a suggestion to improve your approach:

You can use a loop to check if A + B is at most 16. If it is not, then you can print ":(". If it is, then you can check if A and B are integers between 1 and 16 (inclusive). If they are, then you can check if the same person should not take two adjacent pieces of

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few areas that can be improved. First, you can simplify the problem by focusing on the number of pairs of boxes that have the same remainder when divided by $k$. This can be done by creating a histogram of the remainders of the number of candies in each box divided by $k$.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a StringBuilder object to modify the string S instead of using string concatenation. This is because string concatenation can be computationally expensive and can lead to performance issues. Using a StringBuilder object allows you to modify the string in place, which can improve the performance of your code.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a modulo operator to calculate the number of days left until the next Sunday. This approach avoids the need for a loop and can be more efficient. Instead of counting the number of days until the next Sunday, you can use the modulo operator to calculate the number of days left in the current week. For example, if today is Saturday, the modulo operator would give you 6, since there are 6 days left in the current week until the next Sunday. This approach can be more efficient and easier to understand.

Instead of counting the number of B's and W's in the string S, you can use a sliding window approach to find the number of black stones and white stones between the two ends of the row of stones. This approach will be more efficient and easier to implement.

==============================
  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to check whether the concatenation is a square number. Instead of squaring the concatenation and then concatenating the result, you can use a faster method such as the "modular exponentiation" algorithm to check whether the concatenation is a square number. This algorithm involves raising the base (in this case, the concatenation) to the power of half the length of the concatenation, modulo the prime p, where p is the product of the two integers. This method is faster and more efficient than the method you have proposed.

==============================
  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the relationship between the operations and the resulting values of a_i. By analyzing the relationships between the operations and the resulting values, you can make more informed decisions about which operations to perform and when to perform them. This can help you maximize the count of i such that a_i=X. Additionally, you can use dynamic programming to solve the problem more efficiently.

==============================
  Your approach is correct, but it can be improved by considering the case where A is greater than the number of squares in the grid. In this case, all the squares will be painted black, so the answer will be 0. You can add a check for this case and return 0 if A is greater than N^2. This will make your code more robust and handle all the possible cases.

==============================
  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more descriptive variable name than "b-a" and "c-b" to make the code more readable. Instead, you could use variables like "pole1Height" and "pole2Height" to make it clear what the values represent. Additionally, you could use a more descriptive variable name for the difference between the heights of the two poles on the left side, such as "pole1ToPole2Diff". This will make the code more understandable and easier to maintain.

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few things you can do to improve it. First, instead of using the modulo operator multiple times, you can use it once and store the result in a variable. This will make your code more efficient and easier to read. Additionally, you can use a loop to check if 9 is contained in the decimal notation of N. This will make your code more concise and easier to understand. Finally, you can use a ternary operator to print "Yes" or "No" based on the result of the loop. This will make your code more concise and

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient data structure to store the toll gates. Instead of using a list of toll gates, you could use a hash set or a bit vector to keep track of which squares are toll gates. This would allow you to quickly check if a square is a toll gate without having to iterate through a list. Additionally, you could use a more efficient algorithm to find the shortest path to the goal, such as using Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm. These algorithms are more efficient than the naive approach of trying all possible paths

  Your approach is good, but there is one small improvement that can be made. Instead of using the variables A, B, C, and D separately, you can use an array to store the weights of the masses on each pan. This will make the code more concise and easier to read.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use an array:

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a regular expression to validate the input string S.

  Your approach is correct, but there is a small mistake in the last line. Instead of "We can see that the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved is x2 - x1," the correct statement should be "We can see that the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved is x1 - x2." This is because we want to find the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved to connect with the first rectangle, and the distance should be measured from the left edge of the first rectangle to the right edge of the second rectangle.

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few things you can do to improve it. First, instead of using a priority queue to find the K smallest and K largest integers, you can use a single priority queue to find both the smallest and largest integers in a single pass. This will save you the extra step of finding the K smallest and K largest integers separately.

Second, instead of using a set to store the integers that are either in the K smallest or K largest integers, you can use a single array to store all the integers. This will save you the extra step of checking if an integer is in

Second, you should consider using a more robust approach to extract the second and subsequent characters of the string, such as using the `string.substring(1)` method. This will ensure that your code is more robust and less prone to errors.

  Your approach is good, but there is a small mistake in the second case. Instead of saying "among the remaining 5 animals, there are 4 cats," you should say "among the remaining 5 animals, there are 3 cats." This is because we already know that there are 3 cats among the first 3 animals, so we only need to find 3 more cats among the remaining 5 animals.

This will make the problem easier to solve and more intuitive. Additionally, you can use a mathematical formula to calculate the number of grams of sand in the upper bulb after t seconds. This formula is:

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to compute the product of the given integers. Instead of using a loop, you can use the built-in `pow` function in C to compute the product. This will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from O(n) to O(log n), where n is the number of integers.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use the `pow` function:

  Your approach is good, but there is one small improvement that can be made. Instead of considering the case where N is a multiple of 500 separately, you can consider the case where N is not a multiple of 500 together with the case where N is a multiple of 500. This will make the code more concise and easier to understand.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code to handle both cases together:

  Your approach is correct, but you can simplify the logic by using a single condition instead of two separate conditions. Instead of checking if B is less than or equal to X and if B is greater than X, you can check if B is less than or equal to X + 1. This will simplify the logic and make the code more readable. Additionally, you can use a ternary operator to make the code more concise.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a set comprehension instead of a for loop to iterate through the characters in S. This can make the code more concise and easier to read. Here is an example of how you can modify the code to use a set comprehension:

S = input()
unique_chars = {char for char in S}
if len(unique_chars) == len(S):

  Your approach is good, but it can be improved by considering the case where the leader is the last person from the west. In this case, the last person from the west needs to face east and has to turn around. The other people do not need to change their directions, so the number of people who have to change their directions is 1 in this case. This is better than the case where the leader is the first person from the west, as it reduces the number of people who have to change their directions.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a hash table to keep track of the connections between cities. This will allow you to quickly look up the number of roads connected to a particular city, rather than having to count the number of times it appears in the input.

  Your approach is good, but there is a small mistake in the calculation of the minimum number of hours you can park for Plan 1. The minimum number of hours you can park is 1 hour, not 2 hours. This is because the fee for Plan 1 is A×T yen, where T is the number of hours you park, and T is at least 1 hour. Therefore, the minimum number of hours you can park for Plan 1 is 1 hour.

To improve your approach, you can consider using a loop to calculate the minimum number of hours you can park for both plans.

This can be done by finding the maximum number of books that can be read within K minutes on Desk A and the maximum number of books that can be read within K minutes on Desk B, and then finding the minimum of these two values.
