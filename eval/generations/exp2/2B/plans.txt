First, we know that the list of divisors of $x$ and $y$ contains $n$ integers, where $n$ is the number of divisors of $x$ and $y$.

We also know that if a number is divisor of both numbers $x$ and $y$ then there are two copies of this number in the list.

So, we can start by finding the number of divisors of $x$ and $y$. We can do this by finding the number of unique divisors in the list.

Let's say the list of divisors of $x$ and $y$ is $L$. We can find the number of unique divisors in $L$ by finding the number of distinct elements in $L$.

We can do this by sorting the list $L$ in ascending order and then finding the number of distinct elements in $L$.

Once we have the number of unique divisors in $L$, we can find the number of divisors of $x$ and $y$ by dividing the number of unique divisors in $L$ by 2.

Now, we know the number of divisors of $x$ and

It is possible that after some operation we can obtain a number with leading zeroes, but it does not matter for this problem.

For example, let's consider the array [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1]. We can start with the first element of the array, which is 1. We can move the window of size 3 to the right and check if the subsequence is a palindrome.

The subsequence is [1, 2, 1]. We can move the window of size 3 to the right again and check if the subsequence is a palindrome.

We can perform the following operation no more than once: choose a non-empty contiguous subsegment of digits in $a$, and replace each digit $x$ from this segment with $f(x)$.

The question is, what is the maximum possible number we can obtain applying this operation no more than once?

Let's consider an example. Suppose $a = 1337$, $f(1) = 1$, $f(3) = 5$, $f(7) = 3$, and we choose the segment consisting of three rightmost digits. We get $1553$ as the result.

Let's call the maximum value $M$, and the minimum value $m$. The instability is $M - m$.

We need to remove one element from the array, so we can either remove the maximum value or the minimum value. Let's call the removed element $x$.

If we remove the maximum value, the new maximum value is $x$, and the new minimum value is $m$. The new instability is $x - m$.

If we remove the minimum value, the new maximum value is $M$, and the new minimum value is $x$. The new instability is $M - x$.

So, the minimum possible instability is the minimum of the two instabilities we just calculated.

Therefore, the solution is to find the maximum and minimum values in the array, calculate the difference between them, and then find the minimum of the two instabilities we just calculated.

The input is a single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 64).

The output is a single integer.

The problem is to find the number of digits in the binary representation of a.

To solve this problem, we need to convert the input integer a to its binary representation.

We can do this by dividing a by 2 until we reach 0.

For example, if the input is 27, we can divide it by 2 to get 13, then divide 13 by 2 to get 6, then divide 6 by 2 to get 3, then divide 3 by 2 to get 1, and finally divide 1 by 2 to get 0.

The number of times we divide a by 2 is the number of digits in the binary representation of a.

Therefore, the output is the number of times we divide a by 2.

In the examples given, the output is 1, 2, 5, and 6, respectively.

First, we need to construct an undirected tree on $n$ vertices with diameter $d$ and degree of each vertex at most $k$.

We can start by constructing a tree with diameter $d$ and degree of each vertex at most $k$. We can do this by creating a tree with $n$ vertices and connecting each vertex to $k$ other vertices.

For example, if $n = 6$, $d = 3$, and $k = 3$, we can create a tree with the following structure:

1 - 2
| |
3 - 4
| |
5 - 6

This tree has diameter $3$ and degree of each vertex at most $3$.

Now, we need to make sure that this tree is connected. We can do this by connecting the vertices in a way that creates a path of length $d$ between any two vertices.

For example, if we want to connect the vertices 1 and 2, we can connect them by adding an edge between them. This will create a path of length $1$ between the vertices 1 and 2.

We can continue this process until we have

First, we need to find the common divisors of all elements in the array. We can do this by finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of each pair of elements.

gcd(1, 2) = 1
gcd(2, 3) = 1
gcd(3, 4) = 1
gcd(4, 5) = 1

So, the common divisors of all elements in the array are 1 and 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2.

In the second test case, the array is [6, 90, 12, 18, 30, 18]. We can find the gcd of each pair of elements as follows:

We can start by finding the number of tuples (A, B) of positive integers that satisfy A \times B = N.

We can do this by finding the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that are divisible by 2.

For example, if N = 3, then the number of positive integers less than or equal to 3 that are divisible by 2 is 2.

So, the number of tuples (A, B) of positive integers that satisfy A \times B = N is 2.

Now, we need to find the number of tuples (A, B, C) of positive integers that satisfy A \times B + C = N.

We can do this by finding the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that are not divisible by 2.

For example, if N = 3, then the number of positive integers less than or equal to 3 that are not divisible by 2 is 1.

So,

First, we need to understand what a regular bracket sequence is. A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters '1' and '+' between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "()()", "(())" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)", "((1+1)+1)"), and ")(" and "(" are not.

Now, let's consider the problem. We are given a bracket sequence $s$ consisting of $n$ opening '(' and closing ')' brackets. We need to calculate the number of positions $i$ such that if we change the type of the $i$-th bracket, then the resulting bracket sequence becomes regular.

Let's start with a simple case. If the bracket sequence is already regular, then we don't need to change anything, so the answer is 0.

Now, let's consider the case when the bracket sequence is not regular. We need to find the positions $i$ such that if we change the type of the $i$-th bracket, then the resulting bracket sequence becomes

1. We know that $t$ is a subsequence of $s$.
2. We need to find the maximum possible length of the substring we can remove so that $t$ is still a subsequence of $s$.
3. We can remove the substring $s[l;r]$ such that $t$ is still a subsequence of $s$.
4. We need to find the maximum possible length of the substring $s[l;r]$.

Let's consider the following example:

$s = "bbaba"$
$t = "bb"$

We can remove the substring $s[2;4]$ such that $t$ is still a subsequence of $s$.

$s_1 = "bb"$
$s_2 = "a"$

Now, $t$ is still a subsequence of $s$.

So, the maximum possible length of the substring we can remove is $3$.

Therefore, the output is $3$.

7. We can then multiply the maximum possible value of x and y to get the maximum possible value of x \* y.

So, the solution is to find the maximum possible value of x and y, and then multiply them to get the maximum possible value of x \* y.

First, we need to understand what a balanced ternary string is. A balanced ternary string is a ternary string such that the number of characters '0' in this string is equal to the number of characters '1', and the number of characters '1' (and '0' obviously) is equal to the number of characters '2'.

Now, we need to find the minimum number of characters to replace in the given string to obtain a balanced ternary string. We can do this by counting the number of characters in the string.

Let's say the given string is $s = "abc"$. We can replace the first character 'a' with '0' to obtain a balanced ternary string. The new string will be $s' = "0bc"$.

Now, we need to find the minimum number of characters to replace in the string $s'$. We can do this by counting the number of characters in the string $s'$.

Let's denote the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination as y.

We know that the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination is the smallest possible if the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination is the smallest possible among all possible absolute values.

Let's consider the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination for each possible absolute value.

For example, if the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination is 1, then the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination is the smallest possible if the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination is 1.

The problem is to determine whether the number is odd or even.

We can use the modulo operator to check if the number is odd or even.

If the number is odd, the result of the modulo operation will be 1.

If the number is even, the result of the modulo operation will be 0.

So, we can write a program that takes an integer as input and checks if the result of the modulo operation is 1 or 0.

If the result is 1, the number is odd.

If the result is 0, the number is even.

The problem is asking us to find the maximum value in an array of integers.

The first line of input data contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10).

The second line of input data contains n space-separated integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 11).

We need to find the maximum value in the array.

We can use a for loop to iterate through the array and find the maximum value.

We can use a variable to store the maximum value and compare each element in the array to it. If the current element is greater than the maximum value, we update the maximum value.

Here is the pseudocode:

max = 0
for i = 1 to n
    if a[i] > max
        max = a[i]

We can also use the built-in function max() to find the maximum value in the array.

First, we need to define what a diverse string is. A string is diverse if it contains consecutive (adjacent) letters of the Latin alphabet and each letter occurs exactly once. For example, the following strings are diverse: "fced", "xyz", "r" and "dabcef". The following string are not diverse: "az", "aa", "bad" and "babc".

Now, let's think about how to check if a string is diverse. We can start by checking if the string contains consecutive letters. We can do this by checking if the string has at least two letters. If it does, we can check if the first letter is followed by the second letter. If it is, we can check if the second letter is followed by the third letter. If it is, we can continue this process until we reach the end of the string. If we find a gap in the sequence of letters, we know that the string is not diverse.

Next, we need to check if each letter in the string occurs exactly once. We can do this by creating a hash table where the keys are the letters in the string and the values are the counts of each letter. If the count of each letter

For example, if the array is [1, 5, 5, 1, 6, 1], we can use a hash table like this:

Let's consider the text "to be or not to be". We can replace the segment of words "to be" with the string "TB" and obtain the text "TB or not TB". The length of the text after the abbreviation is 12.

Let's consider the text "a ab a a b ab a a b c". We can replace the segments of words "ab a a b" and "ab a a b" with the strings "AAA" and "BBB" respectively and obtain the text "a AAA b BBB c". The length of the text after the abbreviation is 13.

Let's consider the text "aa bb aa aa bb bb".

Let's think about the profit of each day.

1. The profit of the $j$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $j$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $l$ to $r$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $\max\limits_{l \le i \le r}a_i$).
2. The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $k$ days of his practice.

1. First, we need to find the subsegments with the sum $0$ in the array.
2. Then, we need to find the minimum number of integers we need to insert into the array to make the subsegments with the sum $0$ disappear.

Let's start with the first step. We need to find the subsegments with the sum $0$ in the array.

We can do this by using a sliding window technique. We can start with the first element of the array and move the window to the right. At each step, we check if the sum of the elements in the window is equal to $0$. If it is, we can insert an integer between the first and the last element of the window to make the sum of the elements in the window not equal to $0$.

Let's consider the following example:

1. First element: 1
2. Second element: -5
3. Third element: 3
4. Fourth element: 2

We can start with the first element and move the window to the right. At each step, we check if the sum of the elements in the window is equal to $

1. Takahashi loves the number 7 and multiples of K.
2. Where is the first occurrence of a multiple of K in the sequence 7,77,777,...?
3. If the sequence contains no multiples of K, print -1 instead.

We can solve this problem by using a loop to iterate through the sequence and check if the current number is a multiple of K. If it is, we can print the position of the current number in the sequence.

Here is the pseudocode for the solution:

1. Read K from the input.
2. Initialize a variable to 1 (since the first number in the sequence is 7).
3. Loop through the sequence:
	* If the current number is a multiple of K, print the position of the current number.
	* Otherwise, increment the position variable by 1 and continue the loop.
4. If the sequence contains no multiples of K, print -1.

Here is the code in Python:

3. Find the number of pairs of indices $(l, r)$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$) such that the value of the median of $p_l, p_{l+1}, \dots, p_r$ is exactly the given number $m$.
4. The median of a sequence is the value of the element which is in the middle of the sequence after sorting it in non-decreasing order. If the length of the sequence is even, the left of two middle elements is used.
5. For example, if $a=[4, 2, 7, 5]$ then its median is $4$ since after sorting the sequence, it will look like $[2, 4, 5, 7]$ and the left of two middle elements is equal to $4$. The median of $[7, 1, 2, 9, 6]$ equals $6$

2. The second element of the sequence is 5.
3. The third element of the sequence is 6.
4. The fourth element of the sequence is 9.
5. The fifth element of the sequence is 12.

We can see that the difference between each element is 4.

So, we can make an arithmetic progression by adding 4 to each element.

1. The first element of the sequence is 14 + 4 = 18.
2. The second element of the sequence is 5 + 4 = 9.
3. The third element of the sequence is 6 + 4 = 10.
4. The fourth element of the sequence is 9 + 4 = 13.
5. The fifth element of the sequence is 12 + 4 = 16.

So, we can make an arithmetic progression by adding 4 to each element.

The minimum number of elements to change to make the given sequence becomes an arithmetic progression is 1.

First, we need to find the maximum number of students in a team. We can do this by finding the maximum difference between the programming skills of any two students.

Let's call this maximum difference $d$. We can find $d$ by finding the maximum programming skill and the minimum programming skill. The difference between these two skills is $d$.

Now, we need to find the maximum number of students in a team. We can do this by finding the maximum number of students that can be in a team with a programming skill difference of $d$.

Let's call this maximum number of students $m$. We can find $m$ by finding the maximum number of students that can be in a team with a programming skill difference of $d$ and a programming skill difference of $d+1$.

2. His goal is to achieve the average score of M points or above on the N subjects.
3. Print the minimum number of points Takahashi needs on the final subject, or -1.

We need to find the minimum number of points Takahashi needs on the final subject to achieve his goal.

Let's denote the average score of Takahashi on the N-1 subjects as X.

We know that X = (A_1 + A_2 +... + A_{N-1}) / N-1.

We also know that Takahashi needs to achieve the average score of M points or above on the N subjects.

So, we can write the equation:

X >= M

We also know that Takahashi has already taken exams on N-1 subjects and scored A_i points on the i-th subject.

So, we can write the equation:

1. We know that the game is played by N players, numbered 1 to N.
2. At the beginning of a game, each player has K points.
3. When a player correctly answers a question, each of the other N-1 players receives minus one (-1) point.
4. There is no other factor that affects the players' scores.
5. At the end of a game, the players with 0 points or lower are eliminated, and the remaining players survive.
6. In the last game, the players gave a total of Q correct answers, the i-th of which was given by Player A_i.

Now, let's think about the problem.

1. We need to determine whether each of the N players survived this game.
2. We can start by initializing an array of N elements, where each element represents the score of a player.
3. We can then iterate through the Q correct answers given by the players, and update the scores of the players accordingly.

First, we need to understand the problem. We are given a binary matrix $a$ of size $n \times m$. We can perform some operations with this matrix. During each operation, we can inverse the row of this matrix or a column of this matrix.

The problem is to sort the initial matrix by some sequence of such operations. The matrix is considered sorted if the array $[a_{1, 1}, a_{1, 2}, \dots, a_{1, m}, a_{2, 1}, a_{2, 2}, \dots, a_{2, m}, \dots, a_{n, m - 1}, a_{n, m}]$ is sorted in non-descending order.

Now, let's think about the solution. We can use a greedy algorithm to solve this problem.

We start with the first row of the matrix. We can either inverse the first row or not inverse the first row. If we inverse the first row, we can sort the first row in non-descending order. If we don't inverse the first row, we can sort the first row in non-ascending order.

1. The input is a string of digits.
2. The length of the string is between 1 and 10, inclusive.
3. The output is "Yes" or "No".

We need to check if the string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.

Let's break down the input string into two parts: the first half and the second half.

1. The first half is the first half of the input string, which is the first half of the string.
2. The second half is the second half of the input string, which is the last half of the string.

We need to check if the first half and the second half are the same. If they are the same, then the input string is a palindrome.

Let's use an example to illustrate the solution.

Input: 373

First half: 37

Second half: 37

The first half and the second half are the same, so the input string is a palindrome.

The problem is to evaluate an arithmetic expression and return the result. The expression will contain between 2 and 10 operands, separated with arithmetic signs plus and/or minus. Each operand will be an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.

The reference solution is incorrect. It is subtracting the result of the expression from 0, which is not correct.

The correct solution is to evaluate the expression and return the result.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. Evaluate the expression.
2. Return the result.

To evaluate the expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). We need to first evaluate the operands, then the operators.

For example, in the expression 8-7+6-5+4-3+2-1-0, we need to first evaluate the operands:

8 - 7 = 1
1 + 6 = 7
7 - 5 = 2
2 + 4 = 6
6 - 3 = 3
3 + 2 = 5
5 - 1 = 4

Next, we need to make sure that each pair has a unique color combination. We can do this by assigning each pair a unique color combination.

Finally, we need to make sure that there are no two consecutive pairs with the same color combination. We can do this by assigning each pair a color combination that is different from the previous pair.

Let's look at some examples to see how this works.

In the first example, we have 4 pairs and 3 colors. We can assign colors as follows:

* Pair 1: Man 1, Woman 2
* Pair 2: Man 2, Woman 3
* Pair 3: Man 3, Woman 2
* Pair 4: Man 1, Woman 3

This satisfies all of the conditions.

3. Vova is a perfectionist, so he considers the wall completed when all parts of the wall has the same height; the wall has no empty spaces inside it.

Now, let's consider the problem.

1. If the wall is already complete, then Vova can complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero).
2. If the wall is not complete, then Vova can complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero).

So, the answer is YES.

1. We have N cities on a number line.
2. The i-th city is located at coordinate x_i.
3. Our objective is to visit all these cities at least once.
4. In order to do so, we will first set a positive integer D.
5. Then, we will depart from coordinate X and perform Move 1 and Move 2 below, as many times as we like:
 - Move 1: travel from coordinate y to coordinate y + D.
 - Move 2: travel from coordinate y to coordinate y - D.
6. Find the maximum value of D that enables us to visit all the cities.
7. Here, to visit a city is to travel to the coordinate where that city is located.

Now, let's analyze the problem.

2. We can travel to the next city by moving either forward or backward by D units.

3. Now we need to understand how to calculate the digit at the position $k_i$ of the sequence. We can do it by counting the number of elements in the previous blocks. For example, if $k_i = 1$, then the digit at the position 1 is 1, because the first block consists of all numbers from 1 to 1. If $k_i = 20$, then the digit at the position 20 is 5, because the 20th element of the sequence is 5.

Let's start with the first condition. We know that each element is between 0 and 9, so we can have 10 possible values for each element.

Next, we know that $b$ is formed from $a$ using the following sequence of operations:

1. Let $b$ be equal to $a$.

$b_1 = 0$;  for every pair of indices $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \le i, j \le n$, if $a_i = a_j$, then $b_i = b_j$ (note that if $a_i \ne a_j$, it is still possible that $b_i = b_j$);  for every index $i \in [1, n - 1]$ either $b_i = b_{i + 1}$ or $b_i + 1 = b_{i + 1}$. 

For example, if $a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]$, then two possible monotonic renumerations of $a$ are $b = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$ and $b = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]$.

2. We can delete an arbitrary set of elements.
3. We need to find the minimum number of elements we need to remove from the given sequence to make it good.

Let's start with the first step. We need to find the minimum number of elements we need to remove from the given sequence to make it good.

Let's consider the following example:

In this example, we need to remove the element $a_4=5$ to make the sequence good. The remaining elements form the sequence $[4, 7, 1, 4, 9]$, which is good.

Let's consider another example:

1. We have N cubes stacked vertically on a desk.
2. We are given a string S of length N. The color of the i-th cube from the bottom is red if the i-th character in S is 0, and blue if that character is 1.
3. We can perform the following operation any number of times: choose a red cube and a blue cube that are adjacent, and remove them. Here, the cubes that were stacked on the removed cubes will fall down onto the object below them.
4. At most how many cubes can be removed?

Let's analyze the problem. We can remove at most N/2 cubes.

Let's consider the following example:

S = 0011

We can remove the second and third cubes from the bottom. Then, the fourth cube drops onto the first cube.

We can remove the first and second cubes from the bottom.

In this example, we removed 4 cubes.

So, the maximum number of cubes that can be removed is N/2.

We need to find the number of possible ways how many people could be in the bus before the first bus stop, if the bus has a capacity equals to $w$.

We can start with the base case, where the bus is empty. In this case, the number of possible ways is $1$, because there is only one way to have $0$ passengers in the bus.

Let's call the minimum number of pieces that can be evenly distributed to the guests in both cases x.

If we have A guests, each guest can take x pieces.
If we have B guests, each guest can take x pieces.

We know that the number of snack pieces is the same for both cases, so we can say that A x = B x.

We also know that x is an integer, so we can divide both sides of the equation by x to get:

A = B

So, the number of guests is the same for both cases.

Therefore, the minimum number of pieces that can be evenly distributed to the guests in both cases is 1.

Let's call the time when the hand of every clock points directly upward again as "t".

We know that the time when the hand of the i-th clock points directly upward again is T_i.

We also know that the time when the hand of the j-th clock points directly upward again is T_j.

We want to find the minimum value of t.

Let's consider the case where the hands of all clocks point directly upward at the same time.

First, we need to understand the problem. We are given two arrays $a$ and $b$, both of length $n$. All elements of both arrays are from $0$ to $n-1$.

We can reorder elements of the array $b$ (if we want, we may leave the order of elements as it is). After that, let array $c$ be the array of length $n$, the $i$-th element of this array is $c_i = (a_i + b_i) \% n$, where $x \% y$ is $x$ modulo $y$.

Our task is to reorder elements of the array $b$ to obtain the lexicographically minimum possible array $c$.

Array $x$ of length $n$ is lexicographically less than array $y$ of length $n$, if there exists such $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$), that $x_i < y_i$, and for any $j$ ($1 \le j < i$) $x_j = y_j$.

The input consists of four lines, each line containing a single digit 0 or 1.

The output is a single digit, 0 or 1.

The problem is to find the majority element in the input.

The majority element is an element that appears more than half of the total number of elements in the input.

In this case, the input consists of four lines, each line containing a single digit 0 or 1.

So, we need to find the element that appears more than half of the total number of elements in the input.

Let's count the number of 0s and 1s in the input.

The first line contains 0, so there is one 0.

The second line contains 1, so there is one 1.

The third line contains 1, so there is one 1.

The fourth line contains 0, so there is one 0.

In total, there are 4 lines, and each line contains a single digit 0 or 1.

So, the total number of elements in the input is 4.

4. He cannot do multiple assignments on the same day, or hang out on a day he does an assignment.

The problem asks us to find the maximum number of days Takahashi can hang out during the vacation if he finishes all the assignments during this vacation.

Let's start by analyzing the constraints.

1. 1 <= N <= 10^6
2. 1 <= M <= 10^4
3. 1 <= A_i <= 10^4

We can see that the number of days Takahashi can hang out is limited by the number of days he has for vacation.

Let's consider the following scenario:

The smallest number that can be divisible by 100 exactly 0 times is 1.

2. We choose one of them and replace it with an integer of our choice between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), possibly the same as the integer originally written.
3. Find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of the N integers on the blackboard after our move.

Let's consider the following example:

N = 3
A_1 = 7
A_2 = 6
A_3 = 8

We choose A_1 and replace it with 4.

N = 3
A_1 = 4
A_2 = 6
A_3 = 8

The greatest common divisor of the three integers on the blackboard is 2, which is the maximum possible value.

So, the solution is to choose the largest integer from the set {1, 2,..., 10^9} and replace it with that integer.

Now, let's think about the problem.

We need to reconstruct the order in which the students entered the classroom.

We can start by finding the student number of the first student who entered the classroom.

We can do this by finding the student number of the student with the smallest A_i value.

Once we have found the student number of the first student, we can add it to the list of students in the order they entered the classroom.

We can then find the student number of the next student who entered the classroom by finding the student number of the student with the smallest A_i value that is greater than the student number of the first student.

We can continue this process until we have added all the student numbers to the list.

Finally, we can print the list of student numbers in the

Let's start by finding the largest integer that Takahashi can buy when he has X yen.

We know that the integer N is sold for A \times N + B \times d(N) yen.

Let's assume that the largest integer that Takahashi can buy is N.

We can calculate the price of N as follows:

A \times N + B \times d(N) = A \times N + B \times (log10(N))

We know that log10(N) is an integer, so we can round it down to the nearest integer.

A \times N + B \times (log10(N)) = A \times N + B \times (log10(N) - 1)

We can simplify this equation by

We can check this by using the index of the third character from the beginning and the second to last character. If there is no C between these two indices, then we can print WA.

We can check this by using a for loop to iterate through the characters of S. If any character is not lowercase, then we can print WA.

So, the solution is:

Now, let's consider the second element of A, A_2. We know that B_2 ≥ max(A_2, A_3), so we can assume that B_2 ≥ A_2.

We can continue this process for each element of A, considering the element at the current position and the element at the next position. We can assume that the current element is greater than or equal to the next element, because we know that B_i ≥ max(A_i, A_{i+1}) for all i.

Finally, we can consider the last element of A,

1. We are given a sequence A of N positive integers.
2. The sequence A must satisfy the following conditions:
	* A is a sequence of N positive integers.
	* 1 ≤ A_1 ≤ A_2 ≤... ≤ A_N ≤ M.
3. We are also given Q quadruples of integers (a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i).
4. We need to find the maximum possible score of A.
5. The score is the sum of d_i over all indices i such that A_{b_i} - A_{a_i} = c_i.

Now, let's think about how we can solve this problem.

1. We can start by sorting the quadruples in non-decreasing order of b_i.
2. We can then iterate through the quadruples and check if the current sequence A satisfies the conditions.
3. If the current sequence A satisfies the conditions, we can calculate the score and update the maximum score.
4. If the current sequence A does not satisfy the conditions, we can move on to the next sequence.

1. First, we need to find the maximum absolute difference of two elements in A.
2. We can do this by comparing each element in A with every other element in A.
3. We can do this by using a nested loop.
4. We need to keep track of the maximum absolute difference we find.
5. We can do this by initializing a variable called maxDiff to 0.
6. We can then compare each element in A with every other element in A and update maxDiff if we find a larger absolute difference.
7. We can do this by using the absolute value function.
8. We can then print the maximum absolute difference we found.

Let's break down the code:

1. First, we need to calculate the distance between each pair of towns. We can do this by using the formula you provided:

distance = sqrt((x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2)

2. Next, we need to calculate the length of each path. We can do this by summing up the distances between each pair of towns in the path.

length = sum of distances between each pair of towns

3. Finally, we need to calculate the average length of all the paths. We can do this by dividing the total length of all the paths by the number of paths.

average length = total length / number of paths

So, the solution to the problem is to calculate the distance between each pair of towns, calculate the length of each path, and then calculate the average length of all the paths.

1. We have a window with a horizontal length of 12, and two curtains, each of length 4, that cover both ends of the window.
2. The uncovered part has a horizontal length of 4.
3. We need to find the total horizontal length of the uncovered parts of the window.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum horizontal length of the uncovered part of the window.

Let's consider two cases:

Case 1: The curtains are hung on the sides of the window.

In this case, the uncovered part of the window has a horizontal length of 4.

Case 2: The curtains are hung on the top and bottom of the window.

In this case, the uncovered part of the window has a horizontal length of 8.

So, the total horizontal length of the uncovered parts of the window is 4 + 8 = 12.

Therefore, the output is 12.

2. Each person gives A_i testimonies, where A_i is the number of testimonies given by Person i.
3. Each testimony is represented by two integers x_{ij} and y_{ij}.
4. If y_{ij} = 1, the testimony says Person x_{ij} is honest; if y_{ij} = 0, it says Person x_{ij} is unkind.

The problem asks us to find the maximum possible number of honest persons among the N people.

Let's start by considering the case where all the testimonies are consistent. In this case, we can easily find the maximum number of honest persons by counting the number of testimonies that say a person is honest.

However, we need to consider the case where the testimonies are not consistent. In this case, we need to find the maximum number of honest persons among the N people while considering the inconsistencies in the testimonies.

To do this, we can use a technique called "inconsistency resolution." This involves considering each person's test

1. If the length of S is at most K, print S without change.
2. If the length of S exceeds K, extract the first K characters in S, append... to the end of them, and print the result.

Let's start with the first condition. If the length of S is at most K, print S without change.

We can use a simple if-else statement to check if the length of S is at most K. If it is, we can print S without change.

if len(S) <= K:
print(S)

Now, let's move on to the second condition. If the length of S exceeds K, extract the first K characters in S, append... to the end of them, and print the result.

We can use the slice() method to extract the first K characters in S.

first_k_chars = S[:K]

We can then append... to the end of the first K characters.

first_k_chars += '...'

Finally, we can print the result.

1. If the singular form of a noun does not end with s, append s to the end of the singular form.

The singular form of "apple" is "apple".

So, the plural form of "apple" is "apples".

2. If the singular form of a noun ends with s, append es to the end of the singular form.

The singular form of "apples" is "apples".

So, we need to find the number of snakes who have no snacks.

Let's start by finding the number of snakes who have at least one snack.

We can do this by finding the number of snakes who have no snacks and subtracting the number of snakes who have no snacks.

Let's call the number of snakes who have no snacks "x".

We know that x = N - sum(A).

So, we can find x by finding the sum of the elements in the array A.

We can do this by summing up all the elements in the array A.

Let's call the sum of the elements in the array A "y".

We know that y = sum(A).

So, we can find y by sum

2. We also know that each crane has two legs, and each turtle has four legs.
3. We need to find a combination of numbers of cranes and turtles in which the statement is correct.

Let's start with the number of cranes. We know that there are X animals in total, and each crane has two legs. So, we can calculate the total number of legs of cranes as follows:

2 \* X

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs of turtles:

4 \* (X - 2)

If we add the total number of legs of cranes and turtles, we get:

2 \* X + 4 \* (X - 2)

We are given that this sum is equal to Y. So, we can write an equation:

2 \* X + 4 \* (X - 2) = Y

We can simplify this equation by combining the like terms:

Let's start with the third step.

3. We need to find the number of paths that start from vertex 1.

We can find the number of paths that start from vertex 1 by using the formula:

Number of paths = (N choose 1) + (N choose 2) + (N choose 3) +... + (N choose N)

where N is the number of vertices in the graph.

So, the number of paths that start from vertex 1 is:

(3 choose 1) + (3 choose 2) + (3 choose 3) = 6 + 3 + 1 = 10

Now, let's move to the second step.

The first step is to find all the positive integers that divide both A and B. We can do this by finding all the positive integers that divide A and B.

The second step is to find the K-th largest positive integer that divides both A and B. We can do this by sorting all the positive integers that divide both A and B in descending order and then selecting the K-th

1. Takahashi has X yen.
2. He gains 1000 happiness points for each 500-yen coin he has.
3. He gains 5 happiness points for each 5-yen coin he has.

We need to find the maximum number of happiness points that can be earned.

Let's consider the number of 500-yen coins and 5-yen coins.

If Takahashi has X yen, he can get 200 500-yen coins and 100 5-yen coins.

The total number of happiness points is:

200 \* 1000 + 100 \* 5 = 20,000 + 500 = 20,500

So, the maximum number of happiness points that can be earned is 20,500.

We can use a for loop to iterate through all the elements of the permutation.

for i in range(1, n):

Let's call the center of the circle (x_c, y_c) and the radius r. We can find the angle of the circle by using the formula:

θ = arctan(y_c / x_c)

We can also find the radius by using the formula:

where (x_1, y_1) is any point on the circle.

We can use the function "str.find" to find the first occurrence of the substring "xxx" in the file name. If the function returns -1, it means that the substring "xxx" is not found in the file name. If the function returns a number greater than -1, it means that the substring "xxx" is found

2. The wolves will attack the sheep.
3. The output should be "unsafe".

So, we need to check if the number of wolves is greater than or equal to the number of sheep. If it is, then the wolves will attack the sheep, and the output should be "unsafe". If it isn't, then the wolves won't attack the sheep, and the output should be "safe".

Let's write the code in Python:

```
S, W = map(int, input().split())
if W >= S:
    print("unsafe")
else:
    print("safe")
```

In this code, we first take the input from the user in the format of two integers separated by a space. We then convert the input into integers using the `map()` function and store them in variables `S` and `W`.

Next, we check if the number of wolves is greater than or equal to the number of sheep. If it is, then we print "unsafe". Otherwise, we print "safe".

2. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the sides is equal to the length of the hypotenuse.

Let's start by finding the sum of the lengths of the sides. We know that the length of the hypotenuse is |CA|, and the lengths of the other two sides are |AB| and |BC|. So, the sum of the lengths of the sides is:

|AB| + |BC| + |CA| = |AB| + |BC| + |CA|

Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the sides is equal to the length of the hypotenuse to find the area of the triangle. We know that the area of the triangle is half the product of the lengths of the sides, so we can write:

Area = (|AB| + |BC| + |CA|) / 2

Now, we can substitute the expression for the sum of the lengths of the sides into the formula for the

Let's describe the solution in words:

1. Read the input from the standard input.

In code, we can write the solution as follows:

# Compute the product of A and B
result = int(a) * int(b)

# Print the result as an integer

In this code, we first read the input from the standard input using the `input()` function. We then split the input into two parts using the `split()` function, and store the values in variables `a` and `b`.

Next, we compute the product of `a` and `b` using the `int()` function to convert them to integers. We then store the result in a variable called `result`.

Let's call the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B as H.

We know that H = T \* X.

We also know that in World B, time passes X times as fast as it does in our world (World A).

So, if X hours pass in World B, X/X = 1 hour passes in World A.

Therefore, we can say that H = T \* X = T \* (X/X) = T.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water that will remain in Bottle 2.

2. The name of every chosen person begins with M, A, R, C, or H.
3. There are no multiple people whose names begin with the same letter.

Let's start with the first condition. We need to choose three people.

Let's consider the second condition. The name of every chosen person begins with M, A, R, C, or H.

Let's consider the third condition. There are no multiple people whose names begin with the same letter.

We can choose three people with the following names:
 - MASHIKE, RUMOI, HABORO
 - MASHIKE, RUMOI, HOROKANAI
Thus, we have two ways.

Therefore, the answer is 2.

1. Takahashi has submitted his code to Problem A.
2. The problem has N test cases, all of which must be passed to get an AC verdict.
3. Takahashi's submission has passed M cases out of the N test cases.

Now, we need to determine whether Takahashi's submission gets an AC.

If M is equal to N, then Takahashi's submission gets an AC. This is because all test cases have been passed, and he has passed all the test cases.

If M is less than N, then Takahashi's submission does not get an AC. This is because he has passed some test cases but not all of them.

If M is greater than N, then Takahashi's submission does not get an AC. This is because he has not passed all the test cases.

Therefore, we can say that Takahashi's submission gets an AC if M is equal to N. Otherwise, it does not get an AC.

2. The string S consists of lowercase English letters.
3. The 3-rd and 4-th characters of S are equal.

We need to check if the above conditions are met.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. We have N routes to get home.
2. Each route has a cost c_i and a time t_i.
3. We need to find the smallest cost of a route that takes not longer than time T.

Let's start by sorting the routes by their costs in ascending order.

1. We sort the routes by their costs in ascending order.
2. We check each route one by one.
3. If the cost of the current route is less than or equal to T, we print the cost of the current route.
4. If the cost of the current route is greater than T, we move on to the next route.

If we reach the end of the routes without finding a route that takes not longer than time T, we print TLE instead.

So, the solution is to sort the routes by their costs in ascending order, check each route one by one, and print the cost of the first route that takes not longer than time T. If there is no such route, we print TLE instead.

So, the minimum total travel expense is 8 yen.

First, we need to understand the problem. We have $n$ cities and $n-1$ roads. Each road is bidirectional and connects two distinct cities. From any city, we can get to any other city by roads. The country's topology is an undirected tree.

The government is afraid to look unfair. They think that people in a city can consider them unfair if there is one company which owns two or more roads entering the city. The government wants to make such privatization that the number of such cities doesn't exceed $k$ and the number of companies taking part in the privatization is minimal.

The first thing we need to do is to find the number of companies $r$ such that it is possible to assign each road to one company in such a way that the number of cities that have two or more roads of one company is at most $k$.

We can start by assigning each road to a company randomly. If we have $n$ cities and $n-1$ roads, we can assign each road to a company randomly.

First, we need to understand the problem. We have $n$ friends, each of whom lives in a house with an integer coordinate $x_i$. Each friend can move to the house with the coordinate $x_i-1$, $x_i+1$, or stay at $x_i$. The number of occupied houses is the number of distinct positions among the final ones.

The problem asks us to find the minimum and maximum number of occupied houses that can be obtained after all moves are performed.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum and maximum number of occupied houses that can be obtained after all moves are performed.

Let's start with the minimum number of occupied houses. We can see that the minimum number of occupied houses is $1$. This is because each friend can only move to the house with the coordinate $x_i-1$, $x_i+1$, or stay at $x_i$. Therefore, each friend can only occupy one house.

Now, let's think about the maximum number of occupied houses. We can see that the maximum number of occupied houses is $n$. This is because each friend can move to the house with the coordinate $

Let's consider the following cases:

Case 1: If the initial charge of Vova's laptop battery is greater than $a$, then Vova can just play and the charge of his laptop battery will decrease by $a$. So, the remaining charge of the battery will be $k - a$.

2. Then, we need to find all possible substrings "abc" in all these strings.
3. Finally, we need to count the total number of substrings "abc" and print it modulo $10^{9} + 7$.

Let's start with the first step.

We can replace all question marks with letters "a", "b" and "c" in $3^k$ ways.

For example, if $s = $"ac?b?c", then we can replace the question marks with "a", "b" and "c" in the following ways:

* "acabac"
* "acabbc"
* "acabcc"
* "acbbac"
* "acbbbc"
* "acbbcc"
* "accbac"
* "accbbc"
* "accbcc"

So, we can obtain $3^k$ strings.

We are given that the length of the parts of the two towers that are not covered with snow are a meters for the west tower and b meters for the east tower.

We can see that the total length of the two towers is 1000 meters.

We can also see that the length of the parts of the two towers that are not covered with snow is 1000 - (a + b) meters.

We are given that the depth of the snow cover is at least 1 meter.

So, we can set up the following equation:

1000 - (a + b) = x

We can solve this equation by subtracting a from both sides:

999 - (a + b) = x - a

We can see that the left side of the equation is equal to the height of the two towers minus the length of the parts of

3. That is, determine whether there is a string T such that S = T + T.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. We need to find a string T such that S = T + T.
2. We can start by finding a string T that is a prefix of S.
3. We can then check if the remaining part of S is a suffix of T.
4. If it is, then we have found a string T such that S = T + T.

Let's write some pseudocode to solve the problem:

```
function isConcatenation(S):
    T = ""
    for i = 1 to N:
        if S[i] = T[i]:
            continue
        else:
            T = S[i]
            break
    if T = "":
        return false

1. We are given a rectangle with four vertices: (0,0), (W,0), (W,H), and (0,H).
2. We are given a point (x,y) which is within the rectangle or on its border.
3. We need to find the maximum possible area of the part whose area is not larger than that of the other.
4. Additionally, determine if there are multiple ways to cut the rectangle and achieve that maximum.

Let's start by finding the maximum possible area of the part whose area is not larger than that of the other.

We can start by drawing a line passing through (x,y) to cut the rectangle into two parts.

The area of the part whose area is not larger than that of the other is the area of the smaller part.

We can find the area of the smaller part by finding the area of the triangle formed by the line and the two vertices of the rectangle that are not on the line.

We can find the area of the triangle by using the formula:

Area = (base \* height) / 2

where base is the length of the base of the triangle and height

First, we need to find the number of good pairs of topics.

We can start by considering the first topic.

If the first topic is interesting for the teacher, then we can choose any other topic as the second topic.

If the first topic is not interesting for the teacher, then we can choose any other topic as the second topic, except the first topic.

So, the number of good pairs of topics is equal to the number of interesting topics for the teacher.

Now, let's consider the second topic.

If the second topic is interesting for the teacher, then we can choose any other topic as the first topic.

If the second topic is not interesting for the teacher, then we can choose any other topic as the first topic, except the second topic.

1. First, we need to find all the connected components of the graph. We can do this by using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.
2. Once we have all the connected components, we need to check if each connected component is a cycle. We can do this by checking if the vertices in the connected component can be reordered in such a way that the first vertex is connected with the second vertex by an edge, the second vertex is connected with the third vertex by an edge, and so on, until the last vertex is connected with the first vertex by an edge.
3. Finally, we need to count the number of connected components that are also cycles.

Let's break down the problem into smaller sub-problems.

1. Finding all the connected components: We can use a DFS algorithm to find all the connected components of the graph. We can start by selecting an arbitrary vertex and then perform a DFS traversal from that vertex. During the traversal, we can keep track of the vertices that we have visited and the edges that we have traversed. Once we have visited all the vertices in the graph, we can use the visited vertices and edges to find all the connected

4. We choose an edge and remove it from the tree.
5. The tree falls apart into two connected components.
6. Let's call an edge nice if neither of the resulting components contains vertices of both red and blue colors.
7. How many nice edges are there in the given tree?

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of nice edges in the given tree. We can do this by counting the number of nice edges in each connected component and then summing them up.

Let's start by finding the number of nice edges in each connected component. We can do this by considering each edge in the tree and checking whether it is nice or not.

An edge is nice if it does not contain any vertices of both red and blue colors. We can check this by considering the colors of the vertices that are connected by the edge. If the edge contains vertices of both red and blue colors

First, we need to find the list of strings of length $k$ lexicographically not less than $s$ and not greater than $t$. We can do this by generating all possible strings of length $k$ and then filtering out the ones that are not lexicographically not less than $s$ and not greater than $t$.

Next, we need to find the median of this list. The median is the middle element of the list, and we can find it by counting the number of elements in the list and then finding the element at the middle index.

Finally, we need to print the median string.

So, the solution is to generate all possible strings of length $k$ and then filter out the ones that are not lexicographically not less than $s$ and not greater than $t$. Then, find the median of the remaining list and print it.

1. The first step is to find the first element of the strictly increasing sequence. We can find it by looking for the first element of the sequence that is not equal to the previous element.
2. Then, we find the last element of the strictly decreasing sequence. We can find it by looking for the last element of the sequence that is not equal to the next element.
3. After that, we insert the first element of the strictly increasing sequence between the last element of the strictly decreasing sequence and the first element of the strictly increasing sequence.
4. We repeat step 1 to 3 until we have inserted all the elements of the strictly increasing sequence.

Now, let's analyze the problem.

1. We can find the first element of the strictly increasing sequence by looking for the first element of the sequence that is not equal to the previous element. This is because the strictly increasing sequence is strictly increasing, so the first element of the sequence is greater than the previous element.

Let's start with the second step. We need to find the maximum height of the decorated trees.

We know that the height of the tallest decorated tree is h_{max} meters. We also know that the height of the shortest decorated tree is h_{min} meters.

We need to find the maximum height of the decorated trees. We can do this by finding the maximum height of the trees that are not decorated.

Let's say the maximum height of the trees that are not decorated is h_{max}' meters. We can find the maximum height of the decorated trees by subtracting the height of the tallest tree that is not decorated from the height of the tallest tree.

1. We need to check if the input is uppercase or lowercase.
2. If the input is uppercase, we should print A.
3. If the input is lowercase, we should print a.

So, we can write a program that checks if the input is uppercase or lowercase and prints the corresponding letter.

Here's an example of how we can do this:

```
# Get the input from the user
alpha = input("Enter a letter: ")

# Check if the input is uppercase
if alpha.isupper():
    print("A")
else:
    print("a")
```

In this program, we first get the input from the user using the `input()` function. We then check if the input is uppercase using the `isupper()` method. If the input is uppercase, we print "A". If it's lowercase, we print "a".

So, if the input is "B", the program will print "A" because "B" is uppercase. If the input is "b", the program will print "a" because "b" is lowercase.

There are 3K + 1 = 3001 different values of X, Y, and Z that satisfy the condition X + Y + Z = 0.

Now, we need to find the number of triples of X, Y, and Z that satisfy the condition X + Y + Z = S.

We can do this by subtracting the number of triples of X, Y, and Z that satisfy the condition X + Y + Z = 0 from the total number of triples of X, Y, and Z that satisfy the condition 0 ≤ X, Y, Z ≤ K.

1. First, we need to find the number of digits in the binary representation of N.
2. We can use the formula for the number of digits in a binary number, which is:

log2(N) + 1

3. Since we are given the base K, we need to convert the number of digits in the binary representation of N to the base K representation.
4. We can use the formula for the number of digits in a base K representation, which is:

logK(N) + 1

5. Since we are given the number of digits in the binary representation of N, we can directly use the formula for the number of digits in a base K representation.
6. Therefore, the solution is:

logK(N) + 1

Note that we need to add 1 to the result because the number of digits in the base K representation of N includes the leading digit.

3. The master's favorite number is 753. The closer to this number, the better.
4. We need to find the minimum possible (absolute) difference between X and 753.

Let's start by considering the length of S. Since S is a string of length between 4 and 10 (inclusive), we know that it has at least 7 digits.

Let's consider the first three digits of S. We can take them out and form X = 123. The difference between X and 753 is 753 - 123 = 630.

Now, let's consider the last three digits of S. We can take them out and form X = 876. The difference between X and 753 is 753 - 876 =

First, we need to find the minimum number of people who could have broken into the basement. We can do this by finding the minimum number of swords that each person could have taken.

Let's call the minimum number of swords that each person could have taken $z$. We know that the total number of swords that each person could have taken is $nz$. We also know that the total number of swords that are left in the basement after the theft is $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n$.

So, we have the following equation:

$$nz = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n$$

We can solve for $z$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $n$.

$$z = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n}$$

Now, we need to find the minimum number of people who could have broken into the basement. We can do this by finding the minimum number of swords that each person could have taken.

Let's start by finding the shortest path between any pair of vertices. We can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path.

We can start from any vertex and perform BFS to find the shortest path to all other vertices. We can keep track of the shortest path and the number of edges in the shortest path.

Once we have the shortest path, we can add the minimum number of edges to make it a tree. We can do this by adding edges between the vertices in the shortest path.

2. We need to find the subset of vertices such that there is no pair of vertices with the distance $k$ or less between them in this subset.

Let's start with the second point. We can use a BFS (breadth-first search) algorithm to find the subset of vertices such that there is no pair of vertices with the distance $k$ or less between them in this subset.

We can use a queue to store the vertices and their distances from the starting vertex. We can also use a set to store the vertices that are already visited.

We can start the BFS from the starting vertex. We can enqueue the starting vertex and set its distance to 0. We can then dequeue the vertex and set its distance to 1. We can then enqueue all of its neighbors that are not already visited and set their distances to 1. We can repeat this process until the queue is empty.

We can then find the subset of vertices with the maximum total weight. We can use a set to store the vertices that are in the subset. We can then iterate through all of the vertices

Let's start with the third step. We need to find the dormitory number where this letter should be delivered.

We know that the room number among all rooms of all dormitories is written on an envelope. We also know that the rooms of the first dormitory go first, the rooms of the second dormitory go after them and so on.

So, we can find the dormitory number by dividing the room number among all rooms of all dormitories by the number of rooms in each dormitory.

For example, if the room number is 12, we can find the dormitory number by dividing 12 by 10 (the number of rooms in the first dormitory).

12 / 10 = 1

So, the dormitory number is 1.

7. If the string is JPY, we can add the value to the total value.

4. The fourth car from the front of the train is the fourth last car from the back.

So, we can see that the i-th car from the front of the train is the N - i + 1-th car from the back.

Therefore, the value of j is N - i + 1.

1. We are given two strings S and T of length N each, both consisting of lowercase English letters.
2. We need to form a new string by alternating the characters of S and the characters of T.
3. We need to print this new string.

Let's start with the first character of S and the first character of T.

1.1. We take the first character of S, which is 'i'.
1.2. We take the first character of T, which is 'c'.

Let's consider the following cases:

Case 1: Company A operates Station 1 and Company B operates Station 2.
In this case, there will be a bus service between Station 1 and 2, so we print Yes.

Case 2: Company A operates Station 1 and Company B operates Station 3.
In this case, there will be a bus service between Station 1 and 3, so we print Yes.

Case 3: Company A operates Station 2 and Company B operates Station 3.
In this case, there will be a bus service between Station 2 and 3, so we print Yes.

Case 4: Company A operates Station 1 and Company B operates Station 1.
In this case, there will be no bus service between Station 1 and 1, so we print No.

1. We have a string of length 3, S, that represents the weather records for some consecutive three days.
2. Each character of S is either S or R, which means it was sunny or rainy on the corresponding day.
3. We need to find the maximum number of consecutive rainy days in this period.

Let's consider an example. Suppose we have the following string: RRS.

1. The first character is R, which means it was rainy on the first day.
2. The second character is R, which means it was rainy on the second day.
3. The third character is S, which means it was sunny on the third day.

Now, we need to find the maximum number of consecutive rainy days. In this case, we have two consecutive rainy days, which is the maximum.

So, the output should be 2.

After step 4, the boxes A and B contain the integers X and Y, respectively, and the boxes B and C contain the integers Y and Z, respectively.

After step 5, the boxes A and C contain the integers X and Z, respectively, and the boxes B and C contain the integers Y and Z, respectively.

Therefore, the final contents of the boxes A, B, and C are 3, 1, and 2, respectively.

1. Takahashi is 30 years old.
2. The cost of the Ferris wheel is 100 yen.
3. Takahashi is 13 years old or older.
4. Takahashi is 5 years old or younger.

We can see that Takahashi is not between 6 and 12 years old. Therefore, the cost of the Ferris wheel is half the cost.

The cost of the Ferris wheel is 100 yen.

The cost of the Ferris wheel is half the cost.

The cost of the Ferris wheel is 50 yen.

Therefore, the cost of the Ferris wheel for Takahashi is 50 yen.

Let's consider the first query. We need to find the minimum number of coins that is necessary to obtain the value $b_j = 8$.

We can use the following approach:

1. We can use one coin with the value of $8$.

2. The goal is to distribute the cards in such a way that each player gets exactly $k$ cards. After the cards are distributed, each player counts the number of cards they have that contain their favorite number. If they get no cards with their favorite number, their joy level is $0$.

Let's start by considering the first player. They will get $k$ cards, and each card will have a number from $1$ to $10^5$. We need to find the maximum number of cards that contain the first player's favorite number. Let's call this number $x$.

2. We can use the following algorithm to find the minimum number of operations:

a. Find the minimum element in the array.
b. Find the maximum element in the array.
c. If the minimum element is not equal to the maximum element, then we need to perform the operation of adding the absolute difference between the minimum and maximum elements to the minimum element.
d. If the minimum element is equal to the maximum element, then we need to perform the operation of subtracting the absolute difference between the minimum and maximum elements from the minimum element.

Let's apply this algorithm to the given example.

1. The minimum element in the array is 1.
2. The maximum element in the array is 6.
3. The minimum element is not equal to the maximum element, so we need to perform the operation of adding the absolute difference between the minimum and maximum elements to the minimum element.

The problem is to find the suitable set of books such that Alice likes at least $k$ books from the chosen set and Bob likes at least $k$ books from the chosen set. The total reading time of these books is minimized.

The input is the number of books $n$ and the number of books Alice and Bob like $k$. The input also contains the description of each book, which includes the amount of time required for reading the book, whether Alice likes the book or not, and whether Bob likes the book or not.

The output is the minimum total reading time of the suitable set of books. If there is no solution, the output is only one integer -1.

Now, let's think about the solution.

First, we need to check if the given array is good or not. If the array is good, we don't need to remove any element. If the array is bad, we need to remove some elements to make it good.

To check if the array is good, we need to check if the length of the array is divisible by 6. If the length is divisible by 6, we can split the array into 6 subarrays of length 1. If the length is not divisible by 6, we can't split the array into 6 subarrays.

To check if the array is good, we also need to check if the elements in the array are in the required sequence. If the elements are in the required sequence, we can split the array into 6 subarrays of length 1. If the elements are not in the required sequence, we can't split the array into 6 subarrays.

3. We want to determine whether the total amount of money in the coins is greater than or equal to X yen.

Let's call the total amount of money in the coins T.

We know that T is at least X yen, so T >= X.

We also know that each coin is 500 yen, so the total amount of money in the coins is equal to K x 500 yen.

So, we can write the equation:

T = K x 500 yen

We want to determine whether T >= X yen.

We can rewrite the equation as:

K x 500 yen >= X yen

We can simplify the equation as:

K >= X / 500

We can see that K is an integer, so we can round X / 500 to the nearest integer.

Let's consider the probability of Snuke winning for each number between 1 and N.

We are also given that D is between 1 and 100, so we can substitute D = 10.

We are also given that x_{2000} = 20.

So, we can calculate x_{2001} as follows:

x_{2001} = rx_{2000} - D = 2 \times 20 - 10 = 30.

2. We need to find a way to split the array such that $sum_1 = sum_3$ and $sum_1$ is maximum possible.
3. We need to find a way to split the array such that $sum_1 = sum_3$.

Let's start with the third point. We need to find a way to split the array such that $sum_1 = sum_3$.

We can start by sorting the array in non-decreasing order. Let's call the sorted array $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$.

We can then split the array into three parts: the first part contains the first $a$ elements of the sorted array, the second part contains the next $b$ elements of the sorted array, and the third part contains the remaining $c$ elements of the sorted array.

We can then calculate the sums of the first and third parts as follows:

Otherwise, we take the new empty box and continue the process above. If we have no empty boxes and there is at least one object not in some box, then Maksim cannot pack the chosen set of objects.

1. First, we need to find all substrings of the given string.
2. Then, we need to check which substrings can be typed using only the available letters.

Let's start with finding all substrings.

A substring of a string $s$ is a non-empty string $x = s[a \ldots b] = s_{a} s_{a + 1} \ldots s_{b}$ ($1 \leq a \leq b \leq n$).

For example, "auto" and "ton" are substrings of "automaton".

So, we need to find all substrings of the given string $s$.

Let's denote the length of the string $s$ as $n$.

There are $\frac{n (n + 1)}{2}$ substrings of the string $s$.

3. Finally, we need to print the edges of the spanning tree such that the maximum degree over all vertices is maximum possible.

Let's start with the first step. We can use Kruskal's algorithm to find a spanning tree of the given graph. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Sort the edges of the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.
2. Pick the edge with the minimum weight and add it to the spanning tree.
3. If the edge connects two vertices that are not in the same connected component, merge the two connected components.
4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until all edges are added to the spanning tree.

Now, let's move on to the second step. We need to find the maximum degree of the vertices in the spanning tree. We can do this by keeping track of the number of edges incident to each vertex in the spanning tree.

First, we need to understand the problem. We are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. In one move, we can jump from the position $i$ to the position $i - a_i$ (if $1 \le i - a_i$) or to the position $i + a_i$ (if $i + a_i \le n$).

For each position $i$ from $1$ to $n$, we want to know the minimum the number of moves required to reach any position $j$ such that $a_j$ has the opposite parity from $a_i$ (i.e. if $a_i$ is odd then $a_j$ has to be even and vice versa).

Now, let's think about the problem in a more abstract way. We can think of the array $a$ as a graph, where each element $a_i$ represents a node in the graph. We can move from one node to another node in the graph in one move, and we can only move to a node that is at most $a_i$ positions away from the current node.

2. Then, we need to find the string that Nikolay obtains after performing the operations.

Let's start with the first step.

To find the number of operations that Nikolay needs to perform, we need to find the number of prefixes of even length in the initial string.

A prefix of even length is a string that starts at the beginning of the string and ends at the position of the last letter of the string.

For example, in the string "ababab", the prefixes of even length are "ab", "abab", and "ababab".

There are three prefixes of even length in the string "ababab".

So, the number of operations that Nikolay needs to perform is 3.

Now, let's move on to the second step.

To find the string that Nikolay obtains after performing the operations, we need to find the string that Nikolay obtains after performing the operations on the initial string.

We know that A and B are different, so we can't have A = B.

We also know that A and B are both wrong, so we can't have A = 1 or A = 2 or A = 3.

Similarly, we can't have B = 1 or B = 2 or B = 3.

So, we can conclude that A = 3 and B = 2.

V = l \* w \* h

where l, w, and h are the dimensions of the cuboid.

l + w + h = L

h = L - l - w

V = l \* w \* h

l + w + h = L

We can use these equations to find the maximum possible volume of the rectangular cuboid.

2. We need to find the number of integers i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) that satisfy the following condition:

For any integer j (1 ≤ j ≤ i), P_i ≤ P_j.

3. We can solve this problem by using a simple algorithm.
4. We can use a loop to iterate through all the integers from 1 to N.
5. For each integer i, we can check if the condition is satisfied.
6. If the condition is satisfied, we can increment a counter.
7. Finally, we can print the value of the counter.

Here is the pseudocode for the solution:

```
n = read_integer()
p = read_array(n)

count = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        if p[i] <= p[j]:
            count += 1

print(count)

1. First, we need to find the number of occurrences of each element in the sequence.
2. Then, we need to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed so that the sequence is a good sequence.

Let's start with the first step. We can use a hash table to store the number of occurrences of each element in the sequence.

For example, if the input sequence is (3, 3, 3, 3), the hash table will look like this:

{3: 4}

This means that the element 3 occurs 4 times in the sequence.

Now, let's move on to the second step. We need to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed so that the sequence is a good sequence.

We can use a greedy algorithm to solve this problem. We start by removing the element with the smallest number of occurrences. In this case, we remove the element 3.

Now, the hash table looks like this:

{}

This means that the sequence is a good sequence.

Therefore, the minimum number of elements that need to be removed is 1

1. We are given five variables x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, and x_5.
2. Each variable was initially assigned a value of i, where i is the variable's index (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).
3. Snuke chose one of these variables and assigned it 0.
4. We are given the values of the five variables after this assignment.
5. We need to find out which variable Snuke assigned 0.

Let's start by analyzing the input. We are given five integers, each representing the value of one of the five variables. We need to find out which variable Snuke assigned 0 to.

Let's consider the first variable, x_1. If Snuke assigned 0 to x_1, then the value of x_1 should be 0. If the value of x_1 is not 0, then Snuke did not assign 0 to x_1.

Let's consider the second variable, x_2. If Snuke assigned 0 to x_2, then the value of x

1. We have a sequence of length N, a = (a_1, a_2,..., a_N).
2. Each a_i is a positive integer.
3. Snuke's objective is to permute the element in a so that the following condition is satisfied:
 - For each 1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1, the product of a_i and a_{i + 1} is a multiple of 4.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. We need to find a permutation of the elements in a such that the product of each pair of consecutive elements is a multiple of 4.
2. We can start by finding a permutation of the elements in a such that the product of each pair of consecutive elements is a multiple of 2.
3. We can then find a permutation of the elements in a such that the product of each pair of consecutive elements is a multiple of 4 by multiplying each pair of consecutive elements by 2.

1. We need to rearrange the characters in s and t to create new strings s' and t'.
2. We need to compare the new strings s' and t' using the lexicographic order.
3. If s' < t', we print Yes; otherwise, we print No.

Let's start with the first step. We can rearrange the characters in s and t by swapping them. For example, if s = "yx", we can rearrange it to "xy" by swapping the first and second characters. Similarly, if t = "axy", we can rearrange it to "yxa" by swapping the first and second characters.

Now, let's move on to the second step. We need to compare the new strings s' and t' using the lexicographic order. We can do this by comparing the characters in each string in order. For example, if s' = "xy" and t' = "yxa", we can compare the first characters of each string, which are "x" and "y". Since "x" comes before "y" in alphabetical order, we know that s' < t'.

Let's consider the following example: A = 7, B = 5, and C = 1. We need to select some positive integers and calculate their sum.

We can select the following integers: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, and so on. Each of these integers is a

4. If the x-coordinate of the red point is smaller than that of the blue point, we can form a friendly pair.
5. If the x-coordinate of the red point is equal to that of the blue point, we can compare the y-coordinates.

7. If the y-coordinate of the red point is equal to that of the blue point, we cannot form a friendly pair.

So, the maximum number of friendly pairs is the number of red points that have a smaller x-coordinate than the corresponding blue point, plus the number of red points that have a smaller x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than the corresponding blue point.

Let's call the number of red points that have a smaller x-coordinate than the corresponding blue point

3. N people will push the switch while passing by the shower.
4. The i-th person will push the switch t_i seconds after the first person pushes it.

We need to find the total time the shower will emit water.

Let's start with the first person. If the first person pushes the switch, the shower will emit water for T seconds.

Let's consider the second person. If the second person pushes the switch after the first person, the shower will emit water for T seconds.

Let's consider the third person. If the third person pushes the switch after the second person, the shower will emit water for T seconds.

We can see that the shower will emit water for T seconds for each person.

So, the total time the shower will emit water is N \* T seconds.

Therefore, the answer is N \* T.

1. We need to extract all the characters in the odd-indexed positions.
2. We need to concatenate them to form a string.

Let's start with the first step. We can use a for loop to iterate through the characters in the string. We can use the modulo operator (%) to find the remainder of the index of each character divided by 2. If the remainder is 1, we know that the character is in an odd-indexed position.

Now, let's move on to the second step. We need to concatenate all the characters in the odd-indexed positions. We can use a string builder to do this. We can add each character to the string builder as we find it in the odd-indexed positions.

Here's the code:

string s = "atcoder";

for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {

1. We are given a letter b as input, which is A, C, G or T.
2. We need to print the letter representing the base that bonds with the base b.
3. We know that A bonds with T, and C bonds with G.

So, if b is A, we need to print T. If b is C, we need to print G. If b is G, we need to print C. If b is T, we need to print A.

So, we can write a program that takes the input b and prints the corresponding base.

Here's the code:

int main() {

So, we need to find the next type of contest.

If the last contest was ABC, the next contest will be ARC.
If the last contest was ARC, the next contest will be ABC.

First, we need to find the number of integers between a and b, inclusive. We can do this by subtracting a from b and adding 1 to get the total number of integers.

Then, we need to find the number of integers that are divisible by x. We can do this by dividing the total number of integers by x and rounding up to the nearest integer.

So, the solution is:

(b - a + 1) / x

This will give us the number of integers between a and b, inclusive, that are divisible by x.

acronym = ""
for word in [s_1, s_2, s_3]:

In this code, we first take the input string and split it into three words using the split() method.
Then, we iterate over the three words and uppercase the initial letter of each word using the upper() method.
Finally, we concatenate the uppercased letters to form the acronym.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of words in the input string. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use constant amount of memory to store the acronym.

2. We need to select one or more cards from these N cards, so that the average of the integers written on the selected cards is exactly A.
3. We need to find the number of ways to select cards such that the average is 8.

Let's start with the brute force approach. We can try all possible combinations of selecting cards and calculate the average of the selected cards. If the average is 8, we will count it as a valid selection.

However, this approach will be very time-consuming, especially when N is large. We need a more efficient approach.

Let's think about the problem in a different way. We can start by selecting one card. There are N cards to choose from, so there are N ways to select one card.

Now, we need to select the second card. We can choose any card from the remaining N-1 cards. There are N-1 ways to select the second card.

Let's start by finding the longest even string that can be obtained by deleting one or more characters from the end of S.

We can start by removing the last character of S and check if the resulting string is even. If it is, we can remove the last character again and check if the resulting string is even. We can continue this process until we find a non-even string.

If we find a non-even string, we can remove the last character of the string and check if the resulting string is even. We can continue this process until we find a non-even string.

If we find a non-even string, we can remove the last character of the string and check if the resulting string is even. We can continue this process until we find a non-even string.

We can reorder the elements of $b$ in any order we want.

Let's choose an arbitrary order of elements.

We can choose the first element of $b$ to be any element of $b$.

Let's choose the first element of $b$ to be the element with the smallest value.

We can choose the second element of $b$ to be any element of $b$ that is not the first element.

Let's start with the third step.

We can buy $k$ shovels without using any special offers by buying the cheapest $k$ shovels. The cost of buying the cheapest $k$ shovels is $k \times a_i$, where $a_i$ is the cost of the $i$-th shovel.

So, the minimum cost of buying $k$ shovels without using any special offers is $k \times a_i$.

Now, let's move to the second step.

1. First, we need to find the bad points. A bad point is an integer point that is covered by more than k segments.
2. Then, we need to remove the minimum number of segments so that there are no bad points.
3. Finally, we need to print the indices of the segments we remove in any order.

Let's start with step 1. We can use a hash table to keep track of the segments that cover each integer point. We can initialize the hash table with all the segments. Then, we can iterate through each segment and check if it covers any bad points. If it does, we can remove the segment from the hash table.

Let's move on to step 2. We can use a greedy algorithm to remove the minimum number of segments. We can start by removing the segment with the highest end point. If the end point is covered by more than k segments, we can remove it. We can repeat this process until there are no more bad points.

Let's move on to step 3. We can print the indices of the segments we remove in any order. We can use a stack to keep track of the segments we remove. We can push

Let's say the current time is $h$ hours and $m$ minutes. We need to find the number of minutes between the current time and the New Year. We can do this by subtracting the number of minutes in the current time from the number of minutes in a day.

2. The first team should have unique skills.
3. The second team should have the same skills.

We can start by finding the maximum size of the first team. We can do this by finding the maximum number of unique skills among all the students.

Let's call the maximum number of unique skills "x". We can find x by finding the maximum number of unique elements in an array of skills.

We can use a hash table to keep track of the unique skills. We can iterate through the array of skills and add each skill to the hash table if it is not already present. If the skill is already present, we can skip it.

Once we have found the maximum number of unique skills, we can find the maximum size of the first team by dividing the number of students by the maximum number of unique skills.

We can then find the maximum size of the second team by dividing the number of students by the maximum number of unique skills.

We can then output the maximum size of the first team and the maximum size of the second team.

We can use a greedy algorithm to solve this problem. We start by assigning cookies to children in the order of their greed factors. We assign the cookie with the largest size to the child with the largest greed factor. We continue this process until we have assigned all cookies to children.

We need to find the concatenation of a and b in this order.

We can do this by concatenating the two integers together.

For example, if a = 1 and b = 21, we can concatenate them as follows:

121

Now, we need to check whether the concatenation is a square number.

We can do this by checking whether the square of the concatenation is equal to the concatenation.

For example, if we square 121, we get 1441.

If we concatenate 1 and 441, we get 1441.

Therefore, the concatenation of a and b in this order is a square number.

Therefore, the output is Yes.

If we add 1 to a_i, we get a_i+1. If we subtract 1 from a_i, we get a_i-1. If we do nothing, we get a_i.

Now, let's think about the second operation. We can add 1 to a_i, subtract 1 from a_i, or do nothing.

2. The square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left is represented as (i, j).
3. Initially, all the squares are white.
4. square1001 wants to draw a picture with black paint.
5. His specific objective is to make Square (i, j) black when s_{i, j}= #, and to make Square (i, j) white when s_{i, j}=..
6. However, since he is not a good painter, he can only choose two squares that are horizontally or vertically adjacent and paint those squares black, for some number of times (possibly zero).
7. He may choose squares that are already painted black, in which case the color of those squares remain black.

Now, let's think about the problem.

1. We need to check if square1001 can achieve his objective.
2. We can start by checking if all the squares that are painted black are adjacent to each other.
3. If they are, then we can paint them black

2. The second rectangle covers the vertical range of [1,2] and the horizontal range of [b,b+W].
3. We need to move the second rectangle horizontally so that it connects with the first rectangle.

Let's denote the horizontal position of the first rectangle as x1 and the horizontal position of the second rectangle as x2.

We need to find the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved.

Let's consider the following cases:

1. x2 < x1: In this case, we need to move the second rectangle to the right by a distance of x1 - x2.
2. x2 > x1: In this case, we need to move the second rectangle to the left by a distance of x2 - x1.
3. x2 = x1: In this case, we don't need to move the second rectangle.

We can see that the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved is x2 - x1.

5. We need to print Yes if he can pay exactly N yen using only his 1-yen and 500-yen coins, and print No otherwise.

Let's start by considering the case where N is a multiple of 500. In this case, we can use infinitely many 500-yen coins to pay N yen.

Now, let's consider the case where N is not a multiple of 500. In this case, we can use the 1-yen coins to make up the difference.

For example, if N = 2018, we can use four 500-yen coins

4. He gets a stomachache if the "best-by" date of the food is X+1 or more days earlier, though.

We can see that Takahashi ate the food B days after he bought it. If B is less than or equal to X, he did not get a stomachache. If B is greater than X, he got a stomachache.

So, we can write a program that outputs "safe" if B is less than or equal to X, "dangerous" if B is greater than X, and "delicious" if B is equal to X.

1. We are given a string S consisting of lowercase English letters.
2. Determine whether all the characters in S are different.

To solve this problem, we can use a set to store the characters in S. We can iterate through the characters in S and add each character to the set. If we encounter a character that is already in the set, we know that the character is not unique, so we can print "no" and stop the program. If we reach the end of the loop without encountering any duplicates, we know that all the characters in S are unique, so we can print "yes".

Here is the pseudocode for the solution:

1. Initialize an empty set, called unique_chars.
2. Iterate through each character in S.
3. If the current character is already in unique_chars, print "no" and stop the program.

Let's start by considering the case where the leader is the first person from the west.

1. The first person from the west needs to face east and has to turn around.

We can see that city 1 appears twice in the input. Therefore, city 1 is connected to 2 roads.

If the current weather is Sunny, the weather tomorrow will be Cloudy.
If the current weather is Cloudy, the weather tomorrow will be Rainy.
If the current weather is Rainy, the weather tomorrow will be Sunny.

So, we can write a function that takes a string S representing the current weather and returns a string representing the expected weather tomorrow.

The minimum number of hours you can park is 1 hour, because you can park for 1 hour and the fee will be A×1=A yen.

The minimum number of hours you can park is 2 hours, because you can park for 2 hours and the fee will be A×2=2A yen.

The minimum number of hours you can park is 3 hours, because you can park for 3 hours and the fee will be A×3=3A yen.

4. After we've processed all the items, we can print the count.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. How do we keep track of the items we've seen?

We can use a hash table, which is a data structure that maps keys to values. In this case, we can use the string as the key and the count as the value.

2. How do we check if an item is already in the hash table?

We can use the `in` operator to check if the item is already in the hash table. If it's not, we add it to the hash table and increment the count.

3. How do we increment the count?

We can use the `+=` operator to increment the count.

Here's the code:

1. The first user has a rating of 2100, which is between 1600 and 1999, so it is "blue".
2. The second user has a rating of 2500, which is between 2000 and 2399, so it is "yellow".
3. The third user has a rating of 2700, which is between 2400 and 2799, so it is "orange".
4. The fourth user has a rating of 2700, which is between 2400 and 2799, so it is "orange".

The minimum number of different colors is 2, because there are two different colors: "blue" and "orange".

The maximum number of different colors is 2, because there are two different colors: "blue" and "orange".

So, the output is 2 2.

1. The customer ordered a bowl of ramen and told which toppings to put on his ramen to a clerk.
2. The clerk took a memo of the order as a string S.
3. S is three characters long, and if the first character in S is o, it means the ramen should be topped with boiled egg; if that character is x, it means the ramen should not be topped with boiled egg.
4. Similarly, the second and third characters in S mean the presence or absence of sliced pork and green onions on top of the ramen.
5. Write a program that, when S is given, prints the price of the corresponding bowl of ramen.

Let's start with the first character in S. If it is o, then the ramen should be topped with boiled egg, so we need to add 100 yen to the price of the ramen. If it is x, then the ramen should not be topped with boiled egg, so we don't need to add anything to the price of the ramen.

First, we know that the formula is A op1 B op2 C op3 D = 7.

We need to replace each of the symbols op1, op2, and op3 with + or - so that the formula holds.

We can start by replacing A with +.

The formula becomes +B op2 C op3 D = 7.

We can replace B with -.

The formula becomes +- op2 C op3 D = 7.

We can replace op2 with +.

The formula becomes ++ C op3 D = 7.

We can replace C with -.

The formula becomes ++ - op3 D = 7.

We can replace op3 with +.

The formula becomes ++ + D = 7.

We can replace D with -.

The formula becomes ++ + - = 7.

This is the only valid solution.

2. The kangaroo's nest is at coordinate X, and he wants to travel to coordinate X as fast as possible.
3. The earliest possible time for the kangaroo to reach coordinate X is the earliest time when he reaches the nest.

Let's denote the kangaroo's position at time t as x(t).

We know that x(t) = x(t-1) + i, where i is the jump length.

We also know that x(t) = X, which means that we want to find the earliest time t such that x(t) = X.

We can write a recurrence relation for x(t) as follows:

x(t) = x(t-1) + i
x(t) = X

We can solve this recurrence relation by setting x(t) = X - i(t-1) and then solving for t.

x(t) = X - i(t-1)

1. We know that the string s consists of uppercase English letters.
2. We also know that there exists a substring of s that starts with A and ends with Z.
3. We want to find the greatest length of the string Snuke can construct.

Let's start by finding the length of the substring that starts with A and ends with Z. We can do this by finding the first occurrence of A and the last occurrence of Z in the string s.

Let's call the first occurrence of A "start" and the last occurrence of Z "end". We can then find the length of the substring by subtracting "start" from "end".

Now, we need to find the greatest length of the string Snuke can construct. We can do this by finding the maximum length of the substring that starts with A and ends with Z.

Let's call this maximum length "max_length". We can then print "max_length" as the answer.

So, the solution is:

1. Find the first occurrence of A in the string s.
2. Find the last occurrence of Z in the string s.

2. Then, we need to find the maximum number of operations that Snuke can perform.

Let's start with the first step.

The maximum number of even numbers on the blackboard is 10.

Now, let's move on to the second step.

The maximum number of operations that Snuke can perform is 2.

Why?

Let's consider the following example:

[8, 12, 40]

After the first operation, Snuke can perform the following operation:

[4, 6, 20]

After the second operation, Snuke can perform the following operation:

[2, 3, 10]

Now, there is an odd number 3 on the blackboard, so he cannot perform the operation any more.

Therefore, the maximum number of operations that Snuke can perform is 2.

Therefore, the output is 2.

Now, let's think about the problem. We need to find the power of Snuke after he exercises N times. We know that the power of Snuke after the i-th exercise is i. So, we need to find the sum of the powers of Snuke after each exercise.

Let's start with the first exercise. The power of Snuke after the first exercise is 1.

Let's move on to the second exercise. The power of Snuke after the second exercise is 2.

Let's move on to the third exercise. The power of Snuke after the third exercise is

In this case, Alice will take the card with 3, and Bob will take the card with 1.
The difference of their scores will be 3 - 1 = 2.

Let's start with the correct answers.

We know that the number of Takahashi's correct answers is the number of problems on which he received an AC once or more.

So, we need to find the number of problems on which he received an AC once or more.

We can do this by keeping track of the number of ACs received for each problem.

Let's say we have a list of ACs received for each problem.

If Takahashi received an AC for the first time on a problem, we can add 1 to the corresponding element in the list.

If Takahashi received an AC for the second time on a problem, we can add 1 to the corresponding element in the list.

The problem is asking us to find the number of possible orders in which the people were standing.

The people were standing in a row yesterday, but now they are unsure of the order in which they were standing.

However, each person remembered the following fact: the absolute difference of the number of the people who were standing to the left of that person, and the number of the people who were standing to the right of that person.

According to their reports, the difference above for person i is A_i.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the number of possible orders.

We can start by considering the first person.

We know that the number of people who were standing to the left of the first person is A_1.

We also know that the number of people who were standing to the right of the first person is N - A_1 - 1.

1. First, we need to find the average of a and b.
2. Then, we need to round up the average to the nearest integer.

Let's start with the first step. We can find the average of a and b by dividing them and then adding them together.

(a + b) / 2

Now, let's round up the average to the nearest integer. We can do this by adding 0.5 to the result of the previous step.

(a + b) / 2 + 0.5

Finally, we can print the result.

print((a + b) / 2 + 0.5)

The final code will look like this:

a, b = input().split()
a = int(a)
b = int(b)

First, we need to understand the problem. We have three friends, and they are going to meet each other. Each friend can change their position by 1 to the left or by 1 to the right. The total pairwise distance is the sum of distances between each pair of friends. The friends want to know the minimum total pairwise distance they can reach if they will move optimally.

Now, let's think about the solution. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We can create a 2D array dp[i][j] to store the minimum total pairwise distance if the first friend moves i times, and the second and third friends move j times.

We can use the following recurrence relation to calculate dp[i][j]:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1] + |a - b|, dp[i-1][j] + |a - c|, dp[i][j-1] + |b - c|)

For each pair, we can check if the numbers in the pair are similar to each other.

If the numbers in the pair are similar to each other, we can add the pair to the hash table.

If the numbers in the pair are not similar to each other, we can return false.

First, we need to determine the minimum time required to reach each floor from the first floor. We can do this by considering two cases:

Case 1: Using the stairs

If we use the stairs, we need to take the minimum time required to reach each floor from the first floor using the stairs. This can be done by summing up the corresponding values of $a_i$ for each floor.

Case 2: Using the elevator

If we use the elevator, we need to take the minimum time required to reach each floor from the first floor using the elevator. This can be done by summing up the corresponding values of $b_i$ for each floor.

Now, we need to determine the minimum total time required to reach each floor from the first floor. This can be done by considering the minimum time required to reach each floor using the stairs and the minimum time required to reach each floor using the elevator.

We can do this by taking the minimum of the two times.

Therefore, the solution is to print the minimum total time required to reach each floor from the first floor.

7. We have to maximize the MEX (minimum excluded) of the array if we can perform any number of such operations (we can even perform the operation multiple times with one element).

First, we know that the array consists of $n$ distinct positive integers. We also know that the array contains two elements $x$ and $y$ such that $x < y$. If we sort the array in increasing order, the differences between all adjacent elements are equal.

We can start by creating an array of size $n$ with the first element being $x$ and the last element being $y$. We can then fill in the remaining elements by iterating through the array and subtracting the previous element from the current element.

For example, if we have an array of size $5$ with the first element being $x = 1$ and the last element being $y = 50$, we can create the following array:

$[1, 2, 3, 4, 50]$

We can then fill in the remaining elements by subtracting the previous element from the current element:

$[1, 2, 3, 4, 50] \to [1, 2, 3, 4, 49]$

$[1, 2, 3, 4, 49] \

First, we need to find a permutation of length $n$ that contains every integer from $1$ to $n$ (inclusive) and, moreover, each number appears exactly once. We can do this by creating a list of numbers from $1$ to $n$ and then shuffling the list.

Next, we need to find a permutation $p$ in which absolute difference (that is, the absolute value of difference) of any two neighboring (adjacent) elements is between $2$ and $4$, inclusive. We can do this by iterating through the list of numbers and swapping adjacent elements if the absolute difference between them is not between $2$ and $4$.

Finally, we need to print any such permutation for the given integer $n$ or determine that it does not exist. We can do this by checking if the list of numbers is in a valid permutation format and if it meets the requirements.

Let's implement this in Python:
```
def find_permutation(n):
    # Create a list of numbers from 1 to n
    nums = list(range(1, n+1))

1. First, we need to find the parity of each index.
2. Then, we need to find the parity of each element.
3. If the parity of each index is the same as the parity of each element, then the array is good.
4. If the parity of each index is different from the parity of each element, then the array is bad.
5. If the array is bad, then we need to find the minimum number of moves to make the array good.
6. If the array is good, then we need to find the minimum number of moves to make the array bad.

Let's start with the first step.

1. First, we need to find the parity of each index.

Let's say we have an array of length $n$.

Let's say the index of the first element is $i$.

Then, the parity of the index $i$ is $i \bmod 2$.

Let's say the index of the second element is $j$.

Then, the parity of the index $j$ is $j \bmod 2$.

1. First, we need to find the subtree that contains the vertex $v$.
2. Then, we need to find the maximum difference between the number of white and black vertices in this subtree.
3. Finally, we need to print the maximum difference for each vertex $v$.

Let's start with the first step. We need to find the subtree that contains the vertex $v$. We can do this by finding the connected subgraph of the given tree that contains the vertex $v$.

Let's denote the connected subgraph of the given tree that contains the vertex $v$ as $T_v$. We can find $T_v$ by finding the connected components of the given tree.

Let's denote the connected components of the given tree as $C_1, C_2, \dots, C_n$. We can find $C_v$ by finding the connected component that contains the vertex $v$.

Let's denote the connected component that contains the vertex $v$ as $C_v$. We can find $C_v$ by finding the vertex $v$ in the connected components of the given tree.

1. We are given an integer $n$.
2. In one move, we can either multiply $n$ by two or divide $n$ by $6$ (if it is divisible by $6$ without the remainder).
3. Our task is to find the minimum number of moves needed to obtain $1$ from $n$ or determine if it's impossible to do that.
4. We have to answer $t$ independent test cases.

Now, let's consider the first test case.

1. We are given the integer $1$.
2. We can multiply $1$ by two to get $2$.
3. We can divide $1$ by $6$ to get $1$.

So, the minimum number of moves needed to obtain $1$ from $1$ is $1$.

Now, let's consider the second test case.

1. We are given the integer $2$.
2. We can multiply $2$ by two to get $4$.
3. We can divide $2$ by $6$ to get $0$.

So, it's impossible to obtain $1$ from $2

1. We are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$.
2. In one operation you can choose two elements of the array and replace them with the element equal to their sum (it does not matter where you insert the new element).
3. Your task is to find the maximum possible number of elements divisible by $3$ that are in the array after performing this operation an arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times.
4. You have to answer $t$ independent queries.

Let's start with the first query. We are given an array $a$ with $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. We need to find the maximum possible number of elements divisible by $3$ that are in the array after performing this operation an arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times.

We can start with the first element of the array, which is $a_1$. If $a_1$ is divisible by $3$, then we can add $3$ to the array and get the maximum number of elements divisible by $3
