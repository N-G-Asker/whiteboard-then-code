  The problem is to find three distinct vertices $a, b, c$ on a tree such that the number of edges which belong to at least one of the simple paths between $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $c$, or $a$ and $c$ is the maximum possible.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D array $dp[i][j]$ where $i$ represents the number of vertices and $j$ represents the number of edges. The $dp[i][j]$ represents the maximum number of edges which belong to at least one of the simple paths between $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $c$, or $a$ and $c$ for a tree with $i$ vertices and $j$ edges.

We can initialize the $dp[i][0]$ for all $i$ as 0, since there is no path between any two vertices in a tree with 0 edges.

We can then iterate through each edge in the tree and update the $dp[i][j]$ for each $i$ and $j$. For each edge $(u, v)$, we can update the $

  The problem is to find two positive integers $x$ and $y$ such that the list of their divisors is the same as the given list of integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. Create a dictionary where the keys are the divisors of $x$ and $y$, and the values are the number of times each divisor appears in the given list.
2. Initialize two variables $x$ and $y$ to 1.
3. For each divisor $d$ in the given list, if $d$ is a divisor of $x$, then increment $x$ by $d$. If $d$ is a divisor of $y$, then increment $y$ by $d$.

  The problem is to find the maximum sum of elements in a matrix that is divisible by a given value $k$. The constraint is that each row can have at most half of the elements chosen, and the sum of the chosen elements must be divisible by $k$.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a two-dimensional array $dp$ of size $n \times m$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the matrix and $m$ is the number of columns. The $i$-th row and $j$-th column of $dp$ will store the maximum sum of elements in the submatrix from the $i$-th row to the last row and from the $j$-th column to the last column that is divisible by $k$.

We can initialize the first row and first column of $dp$ with the value of the first element in the matrix. We can then fill in the rest of the array using the following recurrence relation:

$$dp[i][j] = \max\left(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + a[i][j]\right)$$

  The problem is asking you to find the longest strictly increasing subsequence of a given sequence. A strictly increasing subsequence is a subsequence in which each element is greater than the previous element.

To solve this problem, you can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to create a table where the $i$th row represents the maximum length of a strictly increasing subsequence that ends at the $i$th element of the input sequence. The table should be initialized with the length of the first element of the input sequence.

Then, for each element $j$ in the input sequence, you can calculate the maximum length of a strictly increasing subsequence that ends at $j$ by considering the maximum length of a strictly increasing subsequence that ends at $j-1$ and the length of the subsequence that ends at $j$. The maximum length of a strictly increasing subsequence that ends at $j$ is the maximum of these two values.

Finally, you can print the maximum length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in the last row of the table.

Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:

  The problem is to find the minimum non-negative integer $D$ such that after adding $D$ to some $a_i$, subtracting $D$ from some $a_i$, and leaving some $a_i$ unchanged, all $a_i$ become equal.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by adding $D$ to the first element of the array, then subtracting $D$ from the last element of the array, and then leaving the middle elements unchanged.

We can repeat this process until all elements of the array are equal. If we are unable to make all elements equal, we print -1.

For example, if the input array is $[1, 4, 4, 7, 4, 1]$, we can start by adding $D=3$ to the first element, which gives us $[4, 4, 4, 7, 4, 1]$. Then, we subtract $D=3$ from the last element, which gives us $[4, 4, 4, 7, 1, 1]$. Finally, we leave the middle elements unchanged, which

To solve this problem, we need to find the intersection of the white sheet and the two black sheets. We can do this by finding the points where the edges of the white sheet and the black sheets intersect.

We can start by finding the edges of the white sheet. The bottom edge of the white sheet is the line segment from $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(x_2, y_2)$. The top edge is the line segment from $(x_2, y_2)$ to $(x_1, y_1)$. The left edge is the line segment from $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(x_1, y_2)$. And the right edge is the line segment from $(x_2, y_2)$ to $(x_2, y_1)$.

We can then find the edges of the first black sheet. The bottom edge is the line segment from $(x_3,

  The problem is to find the correct values for the friends' gifts, given that each friend wants to give exactly one gift and receive exactly one gift, and there is no friend who gives the gift to himself.

The solution is to assign the gifts in a way that each friend receives a gift from a different friend, and each friend gives a gift to a different friend.

To do this, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by assigning the gifts to the friends in the order they were given in the input. If a friend wants to give a gift to a specific friend, we assign the gift to that friend. If a friend wants to give a gift to anyone, we assign the gift to the next available friend.

For example, suppose we have the following input:

We start by assigning the gifts to the friends in the order they were given:

  To solve this problem, we need to find a way to color the array $a$ in $k$ colors such that each element is colored in some color, there is at least one element colored in each color, and all elements colored in the same color are distinct.

One way to do this is to use a greedy algorithm. We can start by coloring the first element of the array $a$ with color $1$. Then, we can color the second element of the array $a$ with color $2$ if it is not already colored with color $1$. We can continue this process until we have colored all $n$ elements of the array $a$.

After we have colored all $n$ elements of the array $a$, we can check if the coloring is valid. If it is not valid, we can print "NO" and stop. Otherwise, we can print "YES" and any valid coloring of the array $a$.

For example, if the array $a$ is [1, 2, 2, 3], we can color it as follows:

  This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can break down the problem into smaller sub-problems, where each sub-problem involves finding the minimum number of operations to obtain a number with a specific remainder modulo $10^x$.

Let $dp[i][j]$ be the minimum number of operations to obtain a number with remainder $j$ modulo $10^x$ when the number has $i$ digits. We can initialize $dp[0][j] = 0$ for all $j$ and $dp[i][0] = 1$ for all $i$.

For each $i$ and $j$, we can calculate $dp[i][j]$ as follows:

* If the $i$th digit of the number is 0, we can change it to 1 and obtain a number with remainder $j$ modulo $10^x$. The number of operations required to obtain this number is $dp[i-1][j]$.
* If the $i$th digit of the number is 1, we can change it to 0 and obtain a number with remainder $j-10^x$ modulo $10^

  The problem is to determine if an array has a subsequence of length at least 3 that is a palindrome. A palindrome is an array that reads the same backward as forward.

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We can start by iterating through the array and keeping track of the current subsequence. We can use a variable to keep track of the length of the current subsequence. If the current subsequence is a palindrome, we can return "YES".

If the current subsequence is not a palindrome, we can remove the first element of the subsequence and add the last element of the subsequence. We can then check if the new subsequence is a palindrome. If it is, we can return "YES".

If the new subsequence is not a palindrome, we can continue iterating through the array until we reach the end. If we reach the end and the current subsequence is not a palindrome, we can return "NO".

Here is an example of how this approach would work:

  The problem is asking you to find the maximum number that can be obtained by applying the operation described in the statement no more than once. The operation involves choosing a non-empty contiguous subsegment of digits in $a$ and replacing each digit $x$ from this segment with $f(x)$.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value that can be obtained by applying the operation to the given number $a$. We can do this by finding the maximum value that can be obtained by applying the operation to each digit of $a$ separately.

Let's consider the first digit of $a$. We can apply the operation to this digit by replacing it with $f(1)$. The maximum value that can be obtained by applying the operation to this digit is $f(1)$.

Now, let's consider the second digit of $a$. We can apply the operation to this digit by replacing it with $f(2)$. The maximum value that can be obtained by applying the operation to this digit is $f(2)$.

Similarly, let's consider the third digit of $a$. We can apply the operation to this digit by replacing it with $f(3)$. The maximum

  In this problem, we are given three integers $a \le b \le c$. We have to perform the minimum number of operations in order to obtain three integers $A \le B \le C$ such that $B$ is divisible by $A$ and $C$ is divisible by $B$.

We can perform the following operations:

* Add 1 or -1 to any of the three integers.
* We can perform this operation any (possibly, zero) number of times, we can even perform this operation several times with one number.
* Note that we cannot make non-positive numbers using such operations.

We can start by adding 1 to the smallest number, say $a$. This will make $a+1$ the smallest number. Now, we can add -1 to the second smallest number, say $b$. This will make $b-1$ the second smallest number. Now, we can add 1 to the third smallest number, say $c$. This will make $c+1$ the third smallest number.

Now, we have $a+1, b-1, c+1$. We can perform the following operations:

  The problem is to find the minimum possible instability of an array after removing one element. The instability is calculated as the maximum element minus the minimum element.

To solve this problem, we need to find the element with the maximum value and the element with the minimum value in the array. Then, we can calculate the instability by subtracting the maximum element from the minimum element.

To find the maximum element, we can use a linear scan of the array. We can start by setting the maximum element to the first element of the array. Then, we can compare each element in the array with the current maximum element and update the maximum element if necessary.

To find the minimum element, we can use a linear scan of the array. We can start by setting the minimum element to the first element of the array. Then, we can compare each element in the array with the current minimum element and update the minimum element if necessary.

Once we have found the maximum and minimum elements, we can calculate the instability by subtracting the maximum element from the minimum element.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of moves required to transform $n$ to $m$. We can do this by following a series of moves that will transform $n$ to $m$.

We can start by multiplying $n$ by $2$ to get $2n$. If $m$ is even, we can continue to multiply $2n$ by $2$ to get $4n$, and so on. If $m$ is odd, we can multiply $2n$ by $3$ to get $3n$, and then continue to multiply $3n$ by $2$ to get $6n$, and so on.

We can continue this process until we reach $m$. If we reach $m$ by multiplying $n$ by $2$ repeatedly, we will have $m$ as our final result. If we reach $m$ by multiplying $n$ by $3$ repeatedly, we will have $m$ as our final result.

  The problem is to construct a string $s$ of minimum possible length that has exactly $k$ substrings equal to the given string $t$. The key observation is that we can construct such a string by concatenating $t$ with itself $n-1$ times, and then adding any remaining characters to the end of the string.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Construct the string $s$ by concatenating $t$ with itself $n-1$ times. This gives us a string of length $n(n-1) = n^2-n$ characters.
2. Add any remaining characters to the end of the string $s$ to make it of length $n^2-n+k$ characters. This ensures that there are exactly $k$ positions in the string $s$ where the substring $t$ appears.

For example, if $t = "aba"$ and $k = 4$, then we can construct the string $s$ as follows:

1. Construct the string $s$ by concatenating $t$ with itself $n-1 = 2$ times: $s = "abaaba

  The problem is to find the indices of the array that, when removed, will make the array good.

To solve this problem, we can use a technique called "dynamic programming". We will create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of the elements in the subarray of the original array from index 0 to index j, inclusive, where the element at index i is removed.

We can fill in the dp array as follows:

* dp[i][0] = a[i]
* dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1], a[i] + dp[i-1][j]) for j > 0

The reason for this is that if we remove the element at index i, we have two options:

* We can remove the element at index i-1 and keep the rest of the elements in the subarray. In this case, the maximum sum of the elements in the subarray is dp[i-1][j-1].
* We can remove the element at index i-1 and add the element at index i to the rest

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D array $dp$ of size $n \times k$, where $dp[i][j]$ represents the minimum cost to generate a set $S$ of size $j$ from the first $i$ characters of the string $s$.

We can initialize the first row of $dp$ as follows:

* $dp[0][0] = 0$ (since we need to generate an empty set $S$ of size 0)
* $dp[0][j] = -1$ for $j > 0$ (since we cannot generate a set $S$ of size $j$ from an empty string)

We can then fill in the remaining rows of $dp$ as follows:

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The basic idea of the algorithm is to start from the first vertex and explore the graph depth-first, i.e., we visit a vertex and all its neighbors before moving on to the next vertex.

Here's a step-by-step description of how the algorithm works:

  To solve this problem, we need to find the midpoint of the time interval between $h_1:m_1$ and $h_2:m_2$. Since the contest lasts an even number of minutes, we can assume that the time interval is even.

Let's denote the midpoint of the time interval as $h_3:m_3$. We can write the time interval as $t_1 = h_1:m_1$ and $t_2 = h_2:m_2$.

We know that the time interval is even, so we can write $t_1 + t_2 = 2k$ for some integer $k$. We also know that the time interval lasts at least two minutes, so we can write $m_1 + m_2 \ge 2$.

We can use these constraints to find the solution. Let's first find the value of $k$. We know that $t_1 + t_2 = 2k$, so we can write $h_1 + h_2 = 2k$. Since the time interval lasts at least two minutes, we can write $m_1 + m

1. Start with the input integer.
2. Check if the input integer is greater than or equal to 1. If it is, then the answer is 1.

For example, if the input is 27, we would start with 27 and check if it is greater than or equal to 1. Since it is, we would output 1. Then, we would check if 27 is less than 1. Since

  The problem is to find the longest intersection of a sequence of segments, where each segment is defined by two integer coordinates. The intersection is the set of points that lie within all the segments in the sequence. The problem is to remove exactly one segment from the sequence such that the intersection of the remaining segments has the maximum possible length.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by sorting the segments in the sequence by their left endpoint. We can then iterate through the segments and remove the segment with the smallest right endpoint. We can keep track of the intersection of the remaining segments and update it as we remove segments.

At each step, we can check if the intersection of the remaining segments has the maximum possible length. If it does, we can stop and return the length of the intersection. If it doesn't, we can continue iterating through the segments until we find a segment that can be removed without reducing the length of the intersection.

The time complexity of this approach is $O(n\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of segments in the sequence. The space complexity is $O(n)$, since we need to store the sorted segments and the intersection of the remaining segments.

The wall is considered complete when all parts have the same height and there are no empty spaces inside the wall.

To solve this problem, we need to check if it is possible to complete the wall using any amount of bricks. We can do this by checking if it is possible to complete the wall using a specific amount of bricks. If it is possible to complete the wall using a specific amount of bricks, then it is also possible to complete the wall using any amount of bricks.

We can start by checking if it is possible to complete the wall using 0 bricks. If it is possible to complete the wall using 0 bricks, then it is also possible to complete the wall using any amount of bricks. This is because we can simply put no bricks in the wall and it will still be complete.

To solve this problem, we can start by considering the case where $m = 1$. In this case, we can construct a square of size $1 \times 1$ using any number of tiles we have.

Now, let's consider the case where $m > 1$. We can divide the square into smaller squares of size $m/2 \times m/2$. If we can construct a square of size $m/2 \times m/2$ using the given tiles, then we can construct a square of size $m \times m$ by placing two copies of the smaller square side by side.

However, we need to make sure that the smaller square is a symmetric matrix. This means that the number written in the top-left corner of each tile should be equal to the number written in the bottom-right corner of each tile.

We can start by dividing the initial sequence into two sets A and B such that the first element of the sequence belongs to set A and the second element belongs to set B. We can continue this process by alternating the sets and the elements of the sequence.

For example, if the initial sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, we can divide it into sets A and B as follows:

A = {1, 3, 5}
B = {2, 4, 6}

The difference between the sum of the elements in set A and the sum of the elements in set B is 1.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array $dp[i][j]$ where $i$ is the length of the bracket sequence and $j$ is the length of the substring. $dp[i][j]$ represents the number of regular bracket sequences of length $i$ that contain the substring of length $j$.

We can initialize $dp[0][0] = 1$ since there is only one regular bracket sequence of length $0$ that contains the substring of length $0$.

For $i > 0$, we can calculate $dp[i][j]$ as follows:

Let's consider the number 5071. We can swap the first two digits (5 and 0) to get 5701. Then, we can swap the third and fourth digits (7 and 1) to get 7501. Finally, we can swap the last two digits (5 and 1) to get 7510.

The resulting number 7510 is divisible by 25, and we have made 4 moves to get there. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required to obtain a number that is divisible by 25 is 4.

  This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to consider all possible colorings of the string and calculate the minimum number of colors needed for each coloring. We can use a 2D array dp to store the minimum number of colors needed for each coloring.

The base case is when the string has only one character. In this case, we need only one color.

For the recursive case, we consider all possible colorings of the string. For each coloring, we calculate the minimum number of colors needed for the remaining string. We can use a 2D array dp to store the minimum number of colors needed for each coloring.

We can use a 2D array dp to store the minimum number of colors needed for each coloring. The dp array has two dimensions: the first dimension is the number of colors, and the second dimension is the length of the string.

  This problem is asking you to rearrange a set of strings such that for every string, all strings that come before it are substrings of that string. To solve this problem, you need to find a way to rearrange the strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that come before it are substrings of that string.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this problem:

1. Start by sorting the strings in alphabetical order. This will make it easier to identify which strings are substrings of other strings.
2. For each string, check if it is a substring of any of the strings that come before it. If it is not a substring of any of the strings, then it cannot be rearranged with the other strings.
3. If a string is not a substring of any of the strings that come before it, then it cannot be rearranged with the other strings.
4. If a string is a substring of some of the strings that come before it, then it can be rearranged with the other strings.
5. Once you have identified which strings can be rearranged with the other strings, you can rearrange them in such a way that

  The problem is to find the maximum number of problems that Mishka can solve in a programming contest. The problem is given as a list of problems, where each problem has a difficulty level. Mishka can only solve problems with difficulty level less than or equal to his skill level.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of problems that Mishka can solve. We can do this by finding the maximum number of problems that Mishka can solve from the left end of the list, and the maximum number of problems that Mishka can solve from the right end of the list.

Let's consider the maximum number of problems that Mishka can solve from the left end of the list. We can start by solving the leftmost problem, which has difficulty level $a_1$. If the difficulty level of the next problem is less than or equal to Mishka's skill level, we can solve it and move to the next problem. If the difficulty level of the next problem is greater than Mishka's skill level, we cannot solve it and move to the next problem.

  The problem is to find the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can be formed by coloring exactly $a$ tiles red and exactly $b$ tiles blue, such that the resulting rectangle forms a rectangle with at least one color, and the perimeter of the resulting rectangle is minimal.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by coloring the tiles with the red marker first, and then coloring the remaining tiles with the blue marker. We can keep track of the number of tiles colored with each marker, and the number of tiles colored with each color.

We can then use a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum perimeter of the resulting rectangle. We can start by considering the case where the number of tiles colored with the red marker is equal to the number of tiles colored with the blue marker. In this case, we can form a rectangle with sides $a$ and $b$, and the perimeter of the resulting rectangle is $2(a+b)$.

We can then consider the case where the number of tiles colored with the red marker is greater than the number of tiles colored with the blue marker. In this case, we can

  This problem is a classic problem in computer science known as the "Coloring Problem". The problem is to determine if it is possible to color a string of characters such that after coloring it can become sorted by some sequence of swaps.

The solution to this problem is to use a technique called "Dynamic Programming". The idea is to create a table of size $n \times 2$ where $n$ is the length of the string. The table is initialized with the values of the first character of the string. The table is then filled in by considering all possible colorings of the string and the corresponding swaps.

The table is filled in as follows:

* If the current character is the first character of the string, then the table is initialized with the value of the first character.
* If the current character is not the first character of the string, then the table is initialized with the value of the previous character.
* If the current character is colored the same color as the previous character, then the table is initialized with the value of the previous character.
* If the current character is colored a different color than the previous character, then the table is initialized with the value of the previous character.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the price of a product before tax such that, when the consumption tax rate is 8 percent and 10 percent, the amount of consumption tax levied on it is A yen and B yen, respectively.

First, we need to find the price of the product before tax. Let's call this price P.

Next, we need to find the amount of consumption tax levied on the product when the consumption tax rate is 8 percent. Let's call this amount T8.

We know that T8 = \lfloor P \times 0.08 \rfloor, where \lfloor \cdot \rfloor represents the greatest integer less than or equal to the argument.

We also know that T8 = B yen.

Similarly, we can find the amount of consumption tax levied on the product when the consumption tax rate is 10 percent. Let's call this amount T10.

We know that T10 = \lfloor P \times 0.1 \rfloor.

We also know that T10 = B yen.

  To solve this problem, we need to find an array $a$ of length $k$ that satisfies the conditions:

1. The sum of all $a_i$ for $i$ from $1$ to $k$ should be $n$.
2. $a_i$ should be greater than zero for each $i$ from $1$ to $k$.
3. The condition $a_i < a_{i + 1} \le 2 a_i$ should be satisfied for each $i$ from $1$ to $k-1$.

We can start by considering the first condition. Since the sum of all $a_i$ for $i$ from $1$ to $k$ should be $n$, we can set $a_1 = 1$ and $a_k = n - k + 1$.

Now, we need to consider the second condition. Since $a_i$ should be greater than zero for each $i$ from $1$ to $k$, we can set $a_2 = 2$ and $a_3 = 3$.

Finally, we need to consider the third condition. Since

  The problem is to find the maximum possible size of a subset of projects that Polycarp can choose such that he has enough rating before starting each project, and has non-negative rating after completing each project.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let $dp(i, j)$ be the maximum possible size of a subset of projects that Polycarp can choose such that he has enough rating before starting each project, and has non-negative rating after completing each project, and the subset contains at most $i$ projects. If $j$ is the initial rating of Polycarp, then $dp(i, j) = 0$ if $j < 0$.

We can fill in the table in the following way:

* $dp(0, j) = 0$ for all $j \geq 0$
* $dp(i, j) = 0$ if $j < a_i$
* $dp(i, j) = dp(i - 1, j - b_i)$ if $j \geq a_i$

The maximum possible size of the subset is $dp(n, r)$.

  The problem is asking you to construct a square matrix of size $n$ by $n$ such that each number from the input array is used exactly once, each cell contains exactly one number, and the resulting matrix is palindromic.

To solve this problem, you can use a combination of two techniques:

1. Construct a matrix with the input numbers in the correct order, but with some numbers repeated.
2. Reverse the order of the rows and columns of the matrix to make it palindromic.

Here's an example of how you can solve this problem:

  The problem is asking if it is possible to complete all the projects in a way that Polycarp has enough rating before starting each project, and he has non-negative rating after completing each project.

To solve this problem, we need to find a way to order the projects such that Polycarp has enough rating before starting each project, and he has non-negative rating after completing each project.

We can start by sorting the projects by the amount of rating required to complete them. We can then try to complete the projects in this order, starting with the first project. If Polycarp has enough rating to complete the first project, we can complete it and then move on to the next project. If he doesn't have enough rating to complete the first project, we can't complete it and we need to find a way to complete the previous projects before moving on to the next project.

We can continue this process until we have completed all the projects. If we have enough rating to complete all the projects, we can print "YES". Otherwise, we can print "NO".

In summary, the solution to this problem is to sort the projects by the amount of rating required to complete them, and then try

  This problem is a classic problem in dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of jumps required to reach cell i from cell 0, where j is the number of platforms that have been moved to the left or right.

The base case is dp[i][0] = 1, since we need to jump from cell 0 to cell i.

The recurrence relation is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-c_j][j-1] + 1), where c_j is the length of the j-th platform.

The answer is YES if dp[n+1][m] is less than or equal to d, otherwise the answer is NO.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2m), where n is the width of the river and m is the number of platforms. The space complexity is O(n^2m).

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let $f(i, j)$ be the maximum length of a substring of $s$ that can be removed such that $t$ remains a subsequence of $s$ and the substring ends at position $i$ in $s$. We can compute $f(i, j)$ for each $i$ and $j$ as follows:

* If $i = 0$, then $f(0, j) = 0$.
* If $j = 0$, then $f(i, 0) = 0$.
* If $s[i] = t[j]$, then $f(i, j) = f(i - 1, j - 1) + 1$.

  The problem is to find two integers between 1 and 10, inclusive, that, when added together, give the closest possible sum to the input number x.

To solve this problem, we can start by rounding x to the nearest integer. Let's call this rounded value y.

Next, we can find the absolute difference between x and y. This difference will give us the closest possible sum to x.

For example, if x = 1.200000, y = 1, and the absolute difference is 0.200000.

Now, we can find the closest possible sum to x by adding the absolute difference to y. In this case, the closest possible sum is 1 + 0.200000 = 1.200000.

Therefore, the output for x = 1.200000 is 3 2, where 3 is the integer part of 1.200000 and 2 is the fractional part.

Similarly, for x = 2.572479, the closest possible sum

  To solve this problem, we need to construct an undirected tree on $n$ vertices with diameter $d$ and degree of each vertex at most $k$.

First, we can construct a tree with diameter $d$ by connecting each vertex to its $k$ nearest neighbors. We can do this by creating a graph with $n$ vertices and $n - 1$ edges, where each edge connects two vertices that are at most $d$ apart.

Next, we need to ensure that the degree of each vertex is at most $k$. We can do this by connecting each vertex to its $k$ nearest neighbors, and then connecting each vertex to its $k$ nearest neighbors that are not already connected to it.

Finally, we need to ensure that the tree is undirected. We can do this by connecting each vertex to its $k$ nearest neighbors in both directions.

Here is an example of how we can construct a tree with diameter $d = 2$ and degree of each vertex at most $k = 3$:

1. Fill the string with zeroes and ones alternately.
2. Fill the string with zeroes and ones in a way that ensures that there are exactly $x$ indices $i$ such that $s_i \ne s_{i + 1}$.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Fill the string with zeroes and ones alternately.

We can do this by starting with a string of all zeroes, and then alternating between adding a one and a zero to the end of the string. For example, if we start with a string of all zeroes, we can add a one to the end to get "010000", and then add a zero to the end to get "0100000". We can continue this process to get a

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. Create a string of length $3n$ consisting of $n$ 'a', $n$ 'b', and $n$ 'c' characters.
2. Check if the string $s$ and $t$ appear as substrings in the resulting string. If they do, then we need to create a new string that does not contain $s$ and $t$ as substrings.
3. If the string $s$ and $t$ do not appear as substrings in the resulting string, then we can print "YES" on the first line and the resulting string on the second line.

  The problem is asking us to find a permutation of length $n$ that corresponds to the given array $q$. We can do this by using the information that $q_i=p_{i+1}-p_i$.

We can start by creating an array $p$ of length $n$ where $p_i=i$ for all $i$. Then, we can iterate through the array $q$ and update the values in $p$ accordingly. For example, if $q_i=2$, we know that $p_{i+1}=p_i+2$, so we can set $p_{i+1}=p_i+2$ and $p_{i+2}=p_{i+1}+1=p_i+3$.

Once we have updated the values in $p$, we can check if the resulting permutation is a permutation. If it is not a permutation, we can print -1. Otherwise, we can print the resulting permutation.

Here is an example of how this would work:

Input:

The chips can be moved by 2 to the left or 2 to the right or 1 to the left or 1 to the right and the cost of each move is 1 coin. The chips can be moved to any integer coordinate, including negative and zero.

The solution is to find the minimum number of coins required to move each chip to the same coordinate. The cost of moving a chip to the same coordinate is 0 coins. The cost of moving a chip to a different coordinate is 1 coin.

The solution can be solved using dynamic programming. The dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of coins required to move the first i chips to the same coordinate and the j-th chip is at the coordinate j. The dp[i][j] can be calculated using the following formula:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-2] + 1, dp[i-1][j-1] + 1, dp[i-1][j+1] + 1,

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of moves needed to reach the square (i,j). We can initialize dp[1][1] = 0, as we are already standing at (1,1).

For each move, we can either move down or right. If we move down, we can reach the square (i+1,j) in one move. If we move right, we can reach the square (i,j+1) in one move.

We can calculate dp[i][j] as follows:

  The problem is asking whether the described algorithm will sort the input array correctly. The algorithm is based on the idea of building a stack of ravioli for each number in the array, and then arranging the stacks in one row in the order of the corresponding numbers. The algorithm will remove the tallest stack and add its height to the end of the output array, and then shift the remaining stacks in the row so that there is no gap between them.

The problem is that the algorithm is not guaranteed to produce the correct sorted array. In the second example, the array will change even before the tallest stack is chosen for the first time, and the algorithm will output an array {2, 2, 2} instead of {1, 2, 3}. This is because the algorithm is not considering the possibility that two stacks of ravioli may be next to each other and differ in height by two or more, and the top ravioli of the taller stack may slide down on top of the lower stack.

Therefore, the algorithm will not sort the input array correctly in all cases, and the output will be "NO" in those cases.

  To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that transforms the string $s$ into the string $t$. We can do this by swapping adjacent characters in $s$ to bring it closer to $t$.

We can start by swapping the first two characters of $s$ with the first two characters of $t$. If the characters are different, we are done. If they are the same, we can continue by swapping the next two characters of $s$ with the next two characters of $t$, and so on.

We can continue this process until we have transformed $s$ into $t$. However, we need to be careful not to swap characters that are already in the correct position. We can do this by keeping track of the characters that have already been swapped and only swapping characters that are not in the correct position.

Once we have transformed $s$ into $t$, we can print the number of moves required to do so, which is the number of swaps we made. We can also print the indices of the characters that were swapped, which will be the indices of the characters in $s$ that were swapped with the corresponding characters in $t$.

Let's consider the first example. The given strings are "ba", "a", "abab", "a", "aba", and "baba". We can start by comparing the first two strings, "ba" and "a". The longest common prefix is "a", so we add an "S" to the output string.

Next, we compare "ba" with "abab". The longest common prefix is "ab", so we add an "S" to the output string.

Now we compare "a" with "aba". The longest common prefix is "a", so we add an "S" to the output string.

Finally, we compare "aba" with "baba". The longest common prefix is "aba", so we add an "S" to the output string.

The output string is "SPPSPSPS".

In the second example, the longest common prefix is "aa", so the output string is "PPSS".

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of flats that need to turn off their lights so that no two adjacent flats have both lights on. We can do this by finding the minimum number of flats that need to turn off their lights so that no two adjacent flats have both lights on, and then subtracting 1 from that number.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Find the minimum number of flats that need to turn off their lights so that no two adjacent flats have both lights on.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the first two elements in the array. We can then find the gcd of the first three elements, and so on.

We can continue this process until we have found the gcd of all $n$ elements in the array. The number of common divisors of all elements in the array is equal to the number of times the gcd appears in the array.

For example, if the array is $[2, 4, 6, 2, 10]$, the gcd of the first two elements is $2$, the gcd of the first three elements is $2$, the gcd of the first four elements is $2$, and the gcd of all five elements is $1$. Therefore, the answer is $1$.

In summary, the solution to this problem is to find the gcd of all elements in the array and count the number of times the gcd appears in the array.

  The problem is to distribute a set of coins into the minimum number of pockets such that no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We can sort the coins in non-decreasing order of their values. Then, we can start distributing the coins into pockets. For each coin, we can either put it into a new pocket or put it into an existing pocket that has a different value.

We can keep track of the number of pockets we need to distribute the coins into. We can start with one pocket and add a new pocket for each coin we distribute. If we have already distributed a coin with the same value as the current coin, we can put it into the same pocket.

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n\log n)$ because we need to sort the coins in non-decreasing order of their values. The space complexity is $O(n)$ because we need to keep track of the number of pockets we need to distribute the coins into.

The algorithm works as follows:

For the recursive case, we consider all possible positions of the j-th heater in the array. If the j-th heater is turned on, then we need to consider the following cases:

* The j-th heater is turned on and warms up the first i elements of the array. In this case, we need to consider the following cases:

To solve this problem, we can use a brute force approach. We can start by considering all possible values of A, B, and C, and then check if the equation is satisfied.

We can start by considering all possible values of A, which can range from 1 to N. For each value of A, we can consider all possible values of B, which can range from 1 to N - A. For each value of A and B, we can consider all possible values of C, which can range from 1 to N - A - B.

For each value of A, B, and C, we can check if the equation A \* B + C = N is satisfied. If it is, we can count it as one tuple.

The time complexity of this approach is O(N^3), since we need to consider all possible values of A, B, and C. However, this approach is not efficient enough for large values of N.

To improve the efficiency of this approach, we can use a more efficient

A regular bracket sequence can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters '1' and '+' between the original characters of the sequence. For example, the bracket sequence "()()", which is a regular sequence, can be transformed into the expression "(1)+(1)", and the bracket sequence "(())", which is also a regular sequence, can be transformed into the expression "((1+1)+1)".

Now, let's consider the given bracket sequence $s$. We can change the type of some bracket $s_i$ if it is ')' then we can change it to '(' and vice versa.

We can fill the dp array in a bottom-up manner. For each i, we can find the maximum length of the substring that can be removed from s[0..i] such that t is still a subsequence of s[0..i] by considering all possible j such that t is a subsequence of s[0..j] and s[j+1..i] is a subsequence of t.

We can use a hash table to keep track of the substrings of t that are already present in s. We can initialize the hash table with all the substrings of t.

We can then fill the dp array as follows:

* dp[0][0] = 0
* dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + 1) if t is a subsequence of s[0..

  The problem is to find the maximum value of x \* y, where x and y are integers and a <= x <= b and c <= y <= d hold.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of x \* y for all possible values of x and y that satisfy the given constraints.

We can start by finding the maximum value of x for the given constraints. The maximum value of x is 10^9, since a <= x <= b.

Next, we need to find the maximum value of y for the given constraints. The maximum value of y is also 10^9, since c <= y <= d.

Now, we need to find the maximum value of x \* y for all possible values of x and y that satisfy the given constraints. We can do this by iterating over all possible values of x and y and finding the maximum value of x \* y.

The maximum value of x \* y is 10^18, since x and y can take any value between -10^9 and 10^9.

Therefore, the answer is 10^18.

  The problem is asking for the number of choices of the integer K that make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of choices of K that make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same.

Let's consider the number of problems for ARCs as A and the number of problems for ABCs as B.

We know that A + B = N, since there are N problems in total.

We also know that A >= B, since all problems with difficulty K or higher will be for ARCs.

We can write an equation to represent this:

A + B = N
A >= B

We can solve this equation by subtracting A from both sides:

B = N - A

Now we have:

B = N - A

We can substitute the value of A from the previous equation:

B = N - (A + B)

We can simplify this equation:

B = N - (N - B)

We can simplify this equation further:

  The problem is asking for the maximum number of good sleeping times that Vova can obtain if he acts optimally. To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal way for Vova to sleep at different times during the day.

Let's consider the $i$-th sleeping time. Vova can choose to sleep after $a_i$ hours or after $a_i - 1$ hours. If he chooses to sleep after $a_i$ hours, then the time when he goes to sleep is $a_i$ hours after the time when he woke up. If he chooses to sleep after $a_i - 1$ hours, then the time when he goes to sleep is $a_i - 1$ hours after the time when he woke up.

The optimal way for Vova to sleep at different times during the day is to choose the time when he goes to sleep such that the time when he wakes up is within the segment of the good sleeping time. In other words, Vova should choose the time when he goes to sleep such that the time when he wakes up is between $l$ and $r$ inclusive.

  The problem is to find the maximum number of problems in a contest that can be formed from a given set of problems, subject to the condition that for each problem but the hardest one, there is a problem with a difficulty greater than the difficulty of this problem but not greater than twice the difficulty of this problem.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let $dp[i][j]$ be the maximum number of problems in a contest that can be formed from the first $i$ problems, subject to the condition that the $j$th problem is the hardest problem in the contest.

We can initialize $dp[0][0] = 0$ and $dp[i][0] = 1$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$. This is because there is only one valid contest that can be formed from the first $i$ problems, which is a contest consisting of only the first $i$ problems.

For $j = 1, 2, \ldots, n-1$, we can calculate $dp[i][j]$ as follows:

  The problem is to find the pair of indices $i$ and $j$ such that the least common multiple of $a_i$ and $a_j$ is minimum.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by sorting the array $a$ in non-decreasing order.

Next, we can iterate through the array $a$ and find the first pair of indices $i$ and $j$ such that $a_i$ and $a_j$ are consecutive elements. We can then calculate the least common multiple of $a_i$ and $a_j$ and store it in a variable $lcm$.

We can continue this process until we have found all the pairs of consecutive elements in the array $a$. We can then print the pair of indices $i$ and $j$ such that the least common multiple of $a_i$ and $a_j$ is minimum.

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n\log n)$ and the space complexity is $O(1)$.

  The problem is to find the lexicographically smallest balanced ternary string that can be obtained from a given string by replacing a minimum number of characters. The given string is guaranteed to be a ternary string, and the answer exists.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Count the number of characters '0', '1', and '2' in the given string.
2. If the number of characters '0' is not equal to the number of characters '1', then we can replace the missing characters with '0' or '1' to make the number of '0' equal to the number of '1'.
3. If the number of characters '1' is not equal to the number of characters '2', then we can replace the missing characters with '1' or '2' to make the number of '1' equal to the number of '2'.
4. If the number of characters '0' is not equal to the number of characters '2', then we can replace the missing characters with '0' or '2' to make the number of '0' equal to the number of '2'.

  The problem is asking for the number of ways to climb up a staircase with N steps, where the treads of the a_1-th, a_2-th, a_3-th,..., a_M-th steps are broken. The staircase starts at the 0-th step, and the goal is to climb up to the N-th step without setting foot on the broken steps.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can define a function f(i) that represents the number of ways to climb up the staircase from the 0-th step to the i-th step, where the treads of the a_1-th, a_2-th, a_3-th,..., a_M-th steps are broken.

We can calculate f(i) using the following recurrence relation:

f(i) = f(i-1) + f(i-2)

This is because we can either climb up one step or two steps at a time, and the number of ways to climb up one step is the same as the number of ways

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum absolute value of the coordinate of the destination after making K moves of distance D in the positive or negative direction.

Let's consider a few cases:

1. If X is positive, we can move X - D units to the left, and then move D units to the right to reach the destination. In this case, the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination will be D.
2. If X is negative, we can move X + D units to the right, and then move D units to the left to reach the destination. In this case, the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination will be D.
3. If X is 0, we can move D units to the left or right to reach the destination. In this case, the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination will be D.

So, the minimum absolute value of the coordinate of the destination is D.

Therefore, the solution is to move X - D units to the left or right, and then move D units to the left or right to reach the destination. The absolute value of the coordinate of the destination will be D, which is the minimum possible.

  The problem is to find the number of digits in the number n.

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Divide n by 10 until n is less than or equal to 10.
2. Count the number of times we divided n by 10.
3. Return the count as the number of digits in n.

For example, if n is 11, we divide it by 10 until it is less than or equal to 10. We count the number of times we divided it by 10, which is 1. So, the number of digits in 11 is 1.

If n is 14, we divide it by 10 until it is less than or equal to 10. We count the number of times we divided it by 10, which is 1. So, the number of digits in 14 is 1.

If n is 61441, we divide it by 10 until it is less than or equal to 10. We count the number of times we divided it by 10, which is 6

  The problem is to find the sum of the digits of the integer a.

To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the digits of the integer a. We can do this by converting the integer a to a string and then finding the sum of the digits of the string.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Convert the integer a to a string using the built-in function `str()`.
2. Find the sum of the digits of the string using a loop that iterates over the characters of the string. For each character, we can convert it to an integer using the built-in function `ord()` and then add it to the sum.
3. Return the sum of the digits as the final answer.

Here's an example of how this solution would work for the input 3:

1. Convert the integer 3 to a string: "3"
2. Find the sum of the digits of the string: 3 + 3 = 6
3. Return the sum of the digits as the final answer: 6

Therefore, the final answer for the input 3 is 6.

  The problem is to determine whether the number of digits in the input integer is odd or even. If the number of digits is odd, the output should be 1, otherwise, the output should be 0.

For example, if the input integer is 13, the output should be 1 because the number of digits in the string "13" is odd. If the input integer is 927, the output should be 1 because the number of digits in the string "927" is odd. If the input integer is 48, the output should be 0 because the

* Division
* Modulus (%)
* Exponentiation (^)
* Bitwise AND (&)
* Bitwise XOR (^)

You cannot use any other operations, such as bitwise OR (|), bitwise NOT (~), or any other operations.

The input data is a single line of n space-separated integers, where each integer is between 1 and 11.

The output should be a single integer, which is the maximum value in the array.

In this case, the maximum value in the array is 5, so the output should be 5.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest number of packages that Polycarp needs to buy to get exactly $n$ shovels. We can do this by finding the smallest number of packages that Polycarp needs to buy to get exactly $n$ shovels of each type.

Let's consider the first test case. In this case, Polycarp wants to buy exactly $8$ shovels. The store has $7$ types of packages, and each package has $i$ shovels ($1 \le i \le 7$). We need to find the smallest number of packages that Polycarp needs to buy to get exactly $8$ shovels.

We can start by finding the smallest number of packages that Polycarp needs to buy to get exactly $8$ shovels of the first type. Since the first type has $1$ shovel, we need to buy $8$ packages of this type.

Next, we need to find the smallest number of packages that Polycarp needs to buy to get exactly $8$ shovels of the second type. Since the second type has $2$ shovels, we need to buy $

  The problem is asking us to find the number of combinations of "on" and "off" states of N switches that light all M bulbs. The switches are connected to bulbs in a way that a bulb is lighted when the number of switches that are "on" among the switches connected to it is congruent to the bulb's "on" state modulo 2.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of combinations of "on" and "off" states of the first i switches that light the first j bulbs. We can initialize the first row of dp with 1, since there is only one way to turn on the first bulb.

For each subsequent row, we can calculate the number of combinations of "on" and "off" states of the first i switches that light the first j bulbs as follows:

* If j = 0, we can light the first bulb with any state of the first i switches, so dp[i][0] = 2^i.

  The problem is asking for the distance between the unfixed endpoints of the hour and minute hands at a given time. The hour hand rotates clockwise at a constant angular velocity of 12 hours per rotation, while the minute hand rotates clockwise at a constant angular velocity of 1 hour per rotation.

To solve this problem, we need to find the angle between the two hands at a given time. We can do this by using the fact that the hour hand rotates 12 times faster than the minute hand. So, if the hour hand rotates 12 times in 1 hour, the minute hand rotates 1 time in 1 minute.

We can use the following formula to find the angle between the two hands:

angle = (H / 12) + (M / 1)

where H is the number of hours and M is the number of minutes.

Once we have the angle, we can use the length of the hour and minute hands to find the distance between the unfixed endpoints of the hands. We can use the following formula to find the distance:

distance = A \* sin(angle) + B \* sin(angle)

  The problem is to find the number of pairs of indices $(l, r)$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$) such that the value of median of $a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r$ is exactly the given number $m$.

To solve this problem, we can use a divide-and-conquer approach. We can divide the sequence into two parts: the first part contains all elements less than or equal to the median, and the second part contains all elements greater than the median.

We can then recursively apply this approach to each part, and count the number of pairs of indices that satisfy the condition.

The base case is when the sequence has only one element, in which case there is only one pair of indices that satisfies the condition, and the number of pairs is 1.

The time complexity of this approach is $O(n \log n)$, since we need to sort the sequence in non-decreasing order, which takes $O(n \log n)$ time.

The space complexity is $O(n)$, since we need to store the sorted sequence and the number of pairs of indices that satisfy the condition.

  This problem is a classic problem in dynamic programming. The idea is to find the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array after applying the segments.

We can solve this problem in two steps:

Step 1: Find the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array after applying the segments.

Step 2: Find the optimal subset of segments to apply to the array to maximize the maximum difference.

To solve Step 1, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array after applying the first j segments. We can initialize the table as follows:

dp[i][0] = a[i] - a[1]

where a[i] is the value of the i-th element of the array.

For each j from 1 to m, we can calculate dp[i][j] as follows:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], a[i] - a[j] + dp[j][j-1])

  To solve this problem, we need to check if each string is diverse or not. A string is diverse if it contains consecutive letters of the Latin alphabet and each letter occurs exactly once.

We can start by checking if the string contains consecutive letters. We can do this by checking if the letters in the string are adjacent to each other. If the letters are adjacent, we can check if they are consecutive by checking if the difference between their positions in the alphabet is equal to 1.

Next, we need to check if each letter in the string occurs exactly once. We can do this by creating a hash table where the keys are the letters in the string and the values are the counts of each letter. If the count of each letter is 1, then the letter occurs exactly once.

Finally, we can print "Yes" if the string is diverse and "No" if it is not diverse.

Here is the pseudocode for the solution:

1. Read the input string from the user.

  This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible value of the array obtained by applying the first j segments to the array a.

The base case is dp[i][0] = a[i].

For the recursive case, we consider all possible combinations of segments and calculate the maximum possible value of the array obtained by applying each segment. We take the maximum of these values and store it in dp[i][j].

The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2m), where n is the length of the array a and m is the number of segments. The space complexity is O(n^2m).

The second part of the problem is to find the optimal subset of segments to apply. We can use a similar approach to find the maximum possible value of the array obtained by applying the first j segments to the array a. We store the maximum value and the indices of the segments in a separate array.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2m), where n is the length of the array a and m is the number of segments. The space

  In this problem, we are given a sequence of distinct integers from 1 to n, and we need to find the longest strictly increasing sequence that can be formed by taking either the leftmost or rightmost element from the sequence.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start with the first element of the sequence and add it to our sequence. Then, we can either take the leftmost or rightmost element from the remaining elements in the sequence, depending on which one is greater. We can continue this process until we have added all the elements to our sequence.

For example, let's consider the sequence [2, 1, 5, 4, 3]. We can start with the first element 2 and add it to our sequence. Then, we can either take the leftmost element 1 or the rightmost element 3, depending on which one is greater. If we take 1, our sequence becomes [2, 1], and if we take 3, our sequence becomes [2, 3]. We can continue this process until we have added all the elements to our sequence.

The longest strictly increasing sequence we can form is [2, 1,

  The problem is to find the maximum length of a strictly increasing contiguous subarray of an array after removing at most one element. The subarray is defined as the contiguous sequence of elements in the array that are in strictly increasing order.

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window technique. We start with an empty window, and then iterate through the array, adding each element to the window. If the element is strictly greater than the last element in the window, we add it to the window. If the element is not strictly greater than the last element in the window, we remove the last element from the window and add the new element.

We keep track of the maximum length of the subarray in the window, and return the maximum length of the subarray at the end.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty window.
2. Iterate through the array, adding each element to the window.

  The problem is to find the minimum number of operations required to make at least $k$ elements in the array equal. The only difference between the easy and hard versions is the number of elements in the array.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start with the first element of the array and divide it by 2, rounding down. If the result is equal to the current element, we move on to the next element. If the result is not equal to the current element, we repeat the process until we get an equal result.

We continue this process until we have at least $k$ equal elements in the array. The key insight is that we can always get an equal result by dividing the current element by 2, rounding down, as long as the result is not equal to the current element.

For example, let's say we have the array $a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ and we want to make at least 3 elements equal. We start with the first element, which is 1. We divide it by 2, rounding down, to get 0. Since 0 is not equal to

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of blue balls that will be among the first N balls in the row. We can do this by counting the number of blue balls that will be placed in the first N balls.

Let's consider the first N balls in the row. We can divide them into two parts: the first N - A balls and the last A balls. The first N - A balls will be all red balls, and the last A balls will be all blue balls.

Now, we need to find the number of blue balls that will be among the first N balls. We can do this by counting the number of blue balls that will be placed in the first N - A balls.

We know that the first N - A balls will be all red balls, so the number of blue balls that will be among the first N balls is equal to the number of blue balls that will be placed

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by assuming that $x$ is the smallest possible value, i.e., $x = 2$. We can then check if the list of divisors contains all the divisors of $x$. If it does, then we know that $x$ is the correct answer. If it doesn't, then we can increment $x$ by 1 and repeat the process.

We can continue this process until we find the correct answer or until we reach a value of $x$ that is greater than the largest divisor in the list. If we reach the largest divisor in the list, then we know that the input data is contradictory and it is impossible to find such number $x$ that the given list of divisors is the list of almost all its divisors.

In the example given in the problem, we can start by assuming that $x = 2$. We can then check if the list

  To solve this problem, we need to find the unique elements in the array and remove all the duplicates. We can do this by creating a hash table where the key is the element and the value is the index of the element in the array. We can then iterate through the array and for each element, check if it is already in the hash table. If it is, we remove the element from the array and update the hash table. If it is not, we add it to the hash table.

After we have removed all the duplicates, we can print the number of unique elements in the array and the unique elements in the array.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the nearest larger or equal interesting number for the given number $a$.

First, we need to define what an interesting number is. An interesting number is a positive integer $n$ such that the sum of its digits is divisible by $4$.

Now, let's consider the given number $a$. If $a$ is already an interesting number, then we can simply print it as the nearest larger or equal interesting number.

If $a$ is not an interesting number, we need to find the nearest larger or equal interesting number. We can do this by adding $1$ to $a$ until we get an interesting number.

For example, if $a = 432$, we can add $1$ to $432$ to get $433$, which is an interesting number. So, the nearest larger or equal interesting number for $432$ is $433$.

Similarly, if $a = 99$, we can add $1$ to $99$ to get $100$, which is an interesting number. So, the nearest larger or equal interesting number for $99

* If $j = 1$, then $dp[i][j] = a_i$.
* If $j > 1$, then $dp[i][j] = \max(dp[i-1][j-1], a_i)$.

The total profit is the maximum of all $dp[i][j]$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$ and $j = 1, 2, \ldots, k$.

To find the optimal solution, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start with the first problem and the first day

  The problem is to find the minimum number of integers that need to be inserted into an array of integers to make it so that no subarray has a sum of zero.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by inserting an integer between each pair of adjacent elements of the array. This will ensure that no subarray has a sum of zero.

For example, in the first example, we can insert an integer between the second and third elements of the array, and another integer between the fourth and fifth elements. This will ensure that no subarray has a sum of zero.

In the second example, we don't need to insert any integers because there are no subarrays with a sum of zero.

In the third example, we can insert an integer between the first and second elements, and another integer between the third and fourth elements. This will ensure that no subarray has a sum of zero.

In the fourth example, we can insert an integer between the first and second elements, and another integer between the third and fourth elements. This will ensure that no subarray has a sum of zero.

In the fifth example, we can insert an integer between the first

  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in an array of length $n$ with a given sum $m$.

We can start by considering the case where the array consists of only one element. In this case, the sum of absolute differences is zero, which is the maximum possible value.

Now, let's consider the case where the array consists of more than one element. We can divide the array into two parts: the first part consists of $n-1$ elements, and the second part consists of one element. The sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the first part is zero, since the elements are consecutive. The sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the second part is also zero, since there is only one element in this part.

Therefore, the maximum possible value of the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in an array of length $n$ with a given sum $m$ is the maximum of the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the first part and the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the second part.

We can find the maximum value of the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the first part by

  To solve this problem, we need to find the first occurrence of a multiple of K in the sequence 7, 77, 777,.... We can do this by using a loop that iterates through the sequence and checks if each element is a multiple of K. If we find a multiple, we can print the position of that element and exit the loop. If we don't find a multiple, we can print -1.

Here's an example of how this could be implemented in Python:
```
def find_first_multiple(k, sequence):
    for i, element in enumerate(sequence):
        if element % k == 0:
            return i

result = find_first_multiple(k, sequence)
print(result)

  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pairs of indices $(l, r)$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$) such that the value of the median of $p_l, p_{l+1}, \dots, p_r$ is exactly the given number $m$.

We can solve this problem using a divide and conquer approach. We can divide the sequence into two parts: the first part contains the elements $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_l$ and the second part contains the elements $p_{l+1}, p_{l+2}, \dots, p_n$.

We can then find the median of each part separately and compare it with the given number $m$. If the median of the first part is less than $m$, then we can discard the first part and focus on the second part. If the median of the second part is less than $m$, then we can discard the second part and focus on the first part.

We can repeat this process until we find the median of the remaining part, which is the median of the entire sequence. If the median of the entire sequence is equal to $m$,

  This problem is a classic problem in dynamic programming. The idea is to find the minimum number of days it takes to write the coursework by considering all possible combinations of cups of coffee that Polycarp can drink.

Let's consider the case where Polycarp drinks $k$ cups of coffee during a day. The number of pages he can write during that day is given by the formula:

$$\text{pages} = \sum_{i=1}^k \max(0, a_i - i + 1)$$

where $a_i$ is the caffeine dosage in the $i$th cup of coffee.

Now, let's consider the case where Polycarp drinks $k$ cups of coffee during $d$ days. The number of pages he can write during the $d$ days is given by the formula:

  The problem is to find the minimum number of elements in a sequence that can be changed (by exactly one) to make the sequence an arithmetic progression. The only allowed operation is to add/to subtract one from an element (can't use operation twice to the same position).

To solve this problem, we need to find the longest arithmetic progression in the given sequence. We can do this by finding the longest subsequence of the sequence that is an arithmetic progression.

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We can create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of elements to change in the first i elements of the sequence to make the first i elements an arithmetic progression. We can initialize the first row of the array with the values 0, 1, 2,..., n-1, where n is the length of the sequence.

We can then fill in the rest of the array using the following recurrence relation:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j+1]) + 1

  This problem can be solved using a combination of greedy and dynamic programming techniques.

The greedy approach is to form teams of students with the highest programming skills first, and then balance the teams by adding students with lower programming skills. This approach is optimal because it maximizes the total number of students in the teams while also ensuring that the teams are balanced.

The dynamic programming approach is to consider all possible combinations of teams and their sizes, and then find the maximum total number of students in the teams that satisfy the constraints. This approach is optimal because it considers all possible combinations of teams and their sizes, and it finds the maximum total number of students in the teams that satisfy the constraints.

To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we need to define a two-dimensional array dp of size (n+1) x (k+1), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum total number of students in no more than j non-empty balanced teams of size i or less.

We can initialize the first row of the dp array as follows:

dp[1][1] = 1 (since we can form a team of size 1 with the only student)

  The problem is asking us to find the minimum number of points Takahashi needs to score on the final subject to achieve his goal of having an average score of M points or above on N subjects.

We are given the following information:

* N is the number of subjects Takahashi needs to take.
* K is the maximum score on each subject.
* M is the desired average score.
* A_i is the score Takahashi has already scored on the i-th subject.

We need to find the minimum number of points Takahashi needs to score on the final subject to achieve his goal.

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the total score Takahashi has scored so far by adding up all the scores he has already scored.
2. Calculate the average score Takahashi has achieved so far by dividing the total score by the number of subjects he has taken.
3. Calculate the difference between the desired average score M and the average score Takahashi has achieved so far.
4. If the difference is positive, it means Takahashi needs to score more points on the final subject to achieve his goal

  To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the scores of each player during the game. We can do this by using an array of size N, where each element represents the score of a player.

At the beginning of the game, we initialize the scores of all players to K.

Then, for each question that is answered correctly, we decrease the scores of all players except the one who answered the question by 1.

Finally, at the end of the game, we check if each player has a score of 0 or lower. If a player has a score of 0 or lower, we print "No" for that player. Otherwise, we print "Yes".

Here is the pseudocode for the solution:

1. Initialize an array scores of size N, where each element is initialized to K.
2. For each question that is answered correctly:
	* Decrease the scores of all players except the one who answered the question by 1.

  The problem is to sort a binary matrix by some sequence of row and column inversions. The matrix is considered sorted if the array $[a_{1, 1}, a_{1, 2}, \dots, a_{1, m}, a_{2, 1}, a_{2, 2}, \dots, a_{2, m}, \dots, a_{n, m - 1}, a_{n, m}]$ is sorted in non-descending order.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by sorting the rows of the matrix in non-descending order. We then sort the columns of the matrix in non-descending order.

To sort the rows, we can use a simple algorithm. We start by considering the first row of the matrix. We then compare the first element of this row with the first element of the second row. If the first element of the first row is less than or equal to the first element of the second row, we do nothing. Otherwise, we invert the first row. We then consider the second row and compare the first element of this row with the first element of the third row. If the first element of the second row

  The problem is to determine whether a given string of digits can be rearranged to form a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or number that reads the same backward as it does forward.

To solve this problem, we can start by checking if the string is already a palindrome. If it is, we can output "Yes". If it is not, we can continue to the next step.

Next, we can reverse the string and check if it is a palindrome. If it is, we can output "Yes". If it is not, we can continue to the next step.

Finally, we can check if the original string and the reversed string are anagrams. If they are, we can output "Yes". If they are not, we can output "No".

Overall, the solution to this problem is to check if the string is a palindrome, if it is not, check if it is an anagram of its reverse, and if it is not, output "No".

  This problem is a classic problem in dynamic programming. The idea is to keep track of the maximum number of segments that the robot can pass using the battery and the accumulator at each point in the path.

Let dp[i] be the maximum number of segments that the robot can pass using the battery and the accumulator at the point i in the path. Then, we can define the following recurrence relation:

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + 1, dp[i-2] + 1) if s[i] = 0
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + 1) if s[i] = 1

The first equation states that if the current segment is not exposed to sunlight, then the robot can pass one more segment using the battery and the accumulator. The second equation states that if the current segment is exposed to sunlight, then the robot can pass one more segment using the accumulator.

The base case is dp[0] = 0 and dp[1] = 1.

  The problem writer has provided an arithmetic expression as input, and the task is to evaluate the expression and return the result. However, the reference solution has a bug, which is causing the result to be incorrect.

To solve this problem, we need to identify the bug in the reference solution and fix it. The bug is that the solution is not handling the minus sign correctly. When the minus sign is encountered, it is being treated as an addition operation instead of a subtraction operation.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to handle the minus sign correctly. One way to do this is to check if the current operand is negative, and if so, subtract it from the result instead of adding it. Here is the modified code:
```
result = 0
for operand in expression:
    if operand < 0:
        result -= operand
    else:
        result += operand
return result

With this modification, the bug is fixed, and the correct result is returned for all input expressions.

2. There are no two completely identical pairs.
3. There is no pair such that the color of the man's costume is the same as the color of the woman's costume in this pair.

The key insight is that the maximum sum of beauty values of reposted pictures is equal to the maximum sum of beauty values of all pictures in the news feed, minus the minimum beauty value of all pictures in the news feed.

To find the maximum sum of beauty values of all pictures in the news feed, we can sort the array of beauty values in non-decreasing order and then sum up the beauty values of the first $x$ pictures.

To find the minimum beauty value of all pictures in the news feed, we can find the minimum value in the array of beauty values.

We can place a router in a room if there is a spot for a router in that room. The cost of placing a router in the $i$-th room is $i$ coins. We can place a router in a room if there is a spot for a router in that room.

We can connect all rooms with the numbers from $max(1,~i - k)$ to $min(n,~i + k)$ inclusive to the Internet, where $k$ is the range of router. The value of $k$ is the same for all routers.

To find the minimum total cost of connecting all $n$ rooms to the Internet, we need to find the minimum cost of connecting each room directly to the Internet and the minimum cost of connecting each room using a router. We can then add

  The problem is to determine if two strings, S and T, can be made equal by performing a specific operation on the string S. The operation is to replace every occurrence of two distinct lowercase English letters, c_1 and c_2, with each other. The goal is to determine if S and T can be made equal by performing the operation zero or more times.

To solve this problem, we can use a technique called "two-pointer" or "sliding window" algorithm. The basic idea is to maintain two pointers, one for S and one for T, and move them in tandem. At each step, we compare the characters at the two pointers and if they are the same, we move both pointers forward. If they are not the same, we move the pointer for S forward and then move the pointer for T forward.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

  Takahashi, a novice in competitive programming, wants to learn M algorithms. Initially, his understanding level of each of the M algorithms is 0. He visits a bookstore and finds N books on algorithms. The i-th book (1≤i≤N) is sold for C_i yen (the currency of Japan). If he buys and reads it, his understanding level of the j-th algorithm will increase by A_{i,j} for each j (1≤j≤M). There is no other way to increase the understanding levels of the algorithms. Takahashi's objective is to make his understanding levels of all the M algorithms X or higher. Determine whether this objective is achievable. If it is achievable, find the minimum amount of money needed to achieve it.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum amount of money needed to buy all the books and read them to achieve the objective. We can start by considering the case where all the books are of the same price. In this case, we can buy all the books and read them to achieve the objective. The minimum amount of money needed is the sum of the prices of all the books.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of problems that Takahashi needs to solve to have a total score of G or more points.

We know that the total score of Takahashi is the sum of the base score and the perfect bonuses. The base score is the sum of the scores of all the problems solved by Takahashi, and the perfect bonuses are the points earned when Takahashi solves all the problems with a score of 100i points for each i between 1 and D.

We also know that the total score of Takahashi is at least G points.

Let's first consider the base score. The base score is the sum of the scores of all the problems solved by Takahashi, and the number of problems solved by Takahashi is the number of problems with a score of 100i points for each i between 1 and D.

We can calculate the base score as follows:

Base score = ∑i=1^D (p_i)

We also know that the total score of Takahashi is at least G points.

  The problem is to find the number of ways to choose three sticks with different lengths that can form a triangle.

We can solve this problem by first finding the number of ways to choose three sticks with different lengths. We can do this by using the formula for the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items, which is given by the binomial coefficient:

n! / (k! \* (n-k)!)

In this case, we have n = N, k = 3, and n-k = N-3. So, we can calculate the number of ways to choose three sticks with different lengths as follows:

N! / (3! \* (N-3)!)

We can then subtract the number of ways to choose three sticks with the same length, which is given by the formula:

(N-1) \* (N-2) \* (N-3)

This gives us the final answer:

N! / (3! \* (N-3)!) - (N-1) \* (N-2) \* (N-3)

  The problem is to find the minimum number of moves required to visit all the coordinates X_1, X_2,..., X_M using N pieces. The move is to choose a piece and move it to the next or previous coordinate. The coordinates where the pieces are initially placed are already visited.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by placing the N pieces at the coordinates X_1, X_2,..., X_M. Then, we can move the pieces to the next or previous coordinate one by one, following the move rule.

We can use a hash table to keep track of the coordinates that have been visited. For each coordinate, we can store the number of pieces that have been placed at that coordinate. We can also use a queue to keep track of the coordinates that need to be visited.

The key insight is that we can visit all the coordinates in the order of their absolute values. We can use a priority queue to keep track of the coordinates in this order. We can use the absolute value of each coordinate as the priority of the coordinate in the queue.

We can start by placing the N pieces at the coordinates X_1, X_

  This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a matrix dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of roads needed to travel from the capital to city i using only the first i roads, and using only the roads in the first j options.

The base case is dp[0][0] = 0, since there is no need to travel from the capital to any city if there are no roads.

For the recursive case, we have the following formula:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1, dp[i-1][j] + 1)

This formula is based on the fact that we can either use the j-th option (which includes the j-th road) or not use the j-th option (which means we don't use the j-th road). The minimum number of roads needed to travel from the capital to city i using only the first i roads and using only the roads in the first j options is the minimum of the two options.

We can start by finding the maximum height among the parts. If the maximum height is greater than the height of any part, then it is not possible to complete the wall using any amount of bricks.

Next, we can check whether it is possible to increase the height of all parts to the maximum height. We can do this by iterating through each part and checking whether it is possible to increase its height by 1 or 2. If it is not possible to increase the height of any part, then it

  The problem is asking us to find the first minute after which the monster's hp will be less than or equal to 0, if the battle continues indefinitely. We can solve this problem by analyzing the sequence of hp changes given in the input.

Let's consider the first round. The monster's hp is initially $H$, and it changes by $d_1$ in the first minute of the round. If $d_1 > 0$, the monster's hp will increase by $d_1$ in the first minute, and it will be greater than $H$ after the first minute. If $d_1 < 0$, the monster's hp will decrease by $d_1$ in the first minute, and it will be less than or equal to $H$ after the first minute.

In the second round, the monster's hp is initially $H + d_1$, and it changes by $d_2$ in the second minute of the round. If $d_2 > 0$, the monster's hp will increase by $d_2$ in the second minute, and it

  The problem is to find the most frequent two-gram in a given string. A two-gram is a string of length two, consisting of two consecutive characters. For example, "AB" is a two-gram in the string "ABACABA".

To solve this problem, we can use a hash table to keep track of the number of times each two-gram appears in the string. We can iterate through the string, and for each character, we can check if the next character is also a character in the string. If it is, we can add the two-gram to the hash table, and increment the count for that two-gram.

Once we have counted all the two-grams in the string, we can find the most frequent two-gram by finding the two-gram with the highest count. We can do this by iterating through the hash table and finding the two-gram with the highest count.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Python:
```
def most_frequent_two_gram(s):
    # Initialize a hash table to keep track of the number of times each two-gram appears
    two_grams = {}

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves required to make two given strings $s$ and $t$ equal. We can do this by keeping track of the number of moves required to make each string equal to the empty string.

Let $s_1$ and $t_1$ be the strings obtained by deleting the first character of $s$ and $t$, respectively. Then, we can recursively apply the same approach to $s_1$ and $t_1$.

If $s$ and $t$ are already equal to the empty string, then the answer is the sum of the lengths of the initial strings.

Otherwise, we can apply the move once to either $s$ or $t$, depending on which string has the smaller length. If we apply the move to $s$, then we need to apply the move $s_1$ times to $s_1$ and $t_1$ times to $t_1$. If we apply the move to $t$, then we need to apply the move $t_1$ times to $s_1$ and $s_1$ times to $t_1$.

  The problem is to find the maximum value of D such that it is possible to visit all the cities at least once. The cities are located at coordinates x1, x2,..., xN.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start at coordinate X and perform Move 1 and Move 2 as many times as we like. We can perform Move 1 to travel to coordinates y + D and y - D, where y is the current coordinate.

We can start by setting D = 1. We can then perform Move 1 to travel to coordinates y + 1 and y - 1. If we can reach all the cities at coordinates y + 1 and y - 1, we can set D = 2 and perform Move 1 to travel to coordinates y + 2 and y - 2.

We can continue this process by setting D = 3, then D = 4, and so on. We can keep increasing D until we can no longer reach all the cities at coordinates y + D and y - D.

The maximum value of D that enables us to visit all the cities is the largest D such that we can reach all the cities

  To determine whether a string S is a strong palindrome, we need to check if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. S is a palindrome.
2. The string formed by the 1-st through the (N-1)/2-th characters is a palindrome.
3. The string formed by the (N+3)/2-th through the N-th characters is a palindrome.

We can solve this problem by iterating through the characters of S and checking if they are the same as the corresponding characters in the string formed by the 1-st through the (N-1)/2-th characters and the (N+3)/2-th through the N-th characters. If all of these conditions are satisfied, then S is a strong palindrome.

Here is an example of how we can implement this solution in Python:

def is_strong_palindrome(s):

  To solve this problem, we need to compute the product of two numbers, A and B, and print the result as an integer. The input is given in the format A B, where A is an integer and B is a number with two digits after the decimal point.

1. Read the input from Standard Input in the format A B.
2. Multiply A and B to get the product, which is a floating-point number.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to represent $n$ as the sum of $n=a+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $a>b$.

We can start by considering the case where $n$ is even. In this case, we can write $n=2k$ for some integer $k$. Then, we can write $a=k+1$ and $b=k$, which satisfies all the conditions.

Now, let's consider the case where $n$ is odd. In this case, we can write $n=2k+1$ for some integer $k$. Then, we can write $a=k+1$ and $b=k+1$, which also satisfies all the conditions.

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute exactly $n$ candies between two sisters in a way described in the problem statement is the sum of the number of ways to represent $n$ as the sum of $n=a+b$ for even $n$ and the number of ways to represent $n$ as the sum of $n=a+b$ for odd $n$.

  The problem is to find the minimum number of new roads that need to be built to make all the cities reachable from the capital. The cities are indexed from 1 to n, and the roads are one-way. The input consists of the number of cities, the number of roads, and the index of the capital. The output is the minimum number of extra roads needed to make all the cities reachable from the capital.

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search algorithm. We start at the capital and explore all the reachable cities from it. We keep track of the number of new roads that we need to build to make all the cities reachable. We can use a set to keep track of the cities that we have already visited.

Here is a step-by-step description of the algorithm:

1. Initialize the set of visited cities to be empty.
2. Initialize the number of new roads to be 0.
3. Start at the capital and explore all the reachable cities from it.
4. For each city that we visit, if it is not in the set of visited cities, we add it to the set of visited cities and increment the number of new roads

  The problem is to find the maximum possible number of boxers in a team such that all the boxers' weights in the team are different (i.e. unique). The weights of the boxers can be changed by no more than 1 before the competition, and the weight cannot become equal to zero.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by selecting the boxer with the largest weight and adding them to the team. Then, we can select the boxer with the next largest weight and add them to the team if their weight is different from the weight of the boxer we just added. We continue this process until we have added all the boxers to the team.

The key insight is that we can always add a boxer to the team if their weight is different from the weight of the boxer we just added. This is because we can always increase the weight of the boxer we just added by 1, and then add the boxer with the weight of $a_i$ to the team.

Therefore, the maximum possible number of boxers in a team is $n$, where $n$ is the number of boxers.

  To solve this problem, we need to allocate a 12-digit ID number to each city. The first six digits of the ID number represent the prefecture number, and the last six digits represent the city number within that prefecture.

We can start by sorting the cities by their prefecture number and city number within that prefecture. We can use a hash table to keep track of the city numbers within each prefecture.

For each prefecture, we can start assigning ID numbers to the cities in order of their city number within that prefecture. We can use a counter to keep track of the city number within each prefecture.

  The problem is asking for the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive after a series of attacks. The attacking monster reduces the health of the attacked monster by the amount of its own health. The attacking monster is chosen randomly from the set of alive monsters.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive after all the attacks have been made. We can do this by analyzing the attack pattern and finding the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive after each attack.

Let's consider the attack pattern for the given example:

1. The first monster attacks the second monster, reducing its health to 8.
2. The third monster attacks the fourth monster, reducing its health to 40 - 8 = 32.
3. The first monster attacks the third monster again, reducing its health to 32 - 8 = 24.
4. The second monster attacks the fourth monster again, reducing its health to 40 - 8 - 8 = 24.

After the fourth attack, the last monster alive has a health

  To solve this problem, we need to understand the rules of feeding golorps. A golorp's name is a program in some programming language, and the language is assumed to be Befunge. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.

The first step is to identify the shape of the jaws. The name of the golorp is a string of characters, and each character represents a variable. The shape of the jaws is determined by the number of characters in the name.

For example, if the name of the golorp is "?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.", then the shape of the jaws is 5, because there are 5 characters in the name.

Once we know the shape of the jaws, we can determine the number of variables that the golorp can consume. The number of variables is equal to the shape of the jaws.

For example, if the shape of the jaws is 5, then the golorp can consume 5 variables.

Now, we need to determine the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values that will feed the golorp. This is

  This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of paths from the top-left cell (1, 1) to the cell (i, j) that have a xor sum equal to k.

The base case is dp[1][1] = 1, as there is only one path from (1, 1) to (1, 1) with xor sum equal to 0.

For each cell (i, j) in the grid, we can calculate dp[i][j] using the following formula:

dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]

This formula is derived from the fact that for each cell (i, j), we can either move to the cell (i - 1, j) or to the cell (i, j - 1) to get to the cell (i, j).

The final answer is dp[n][m], which represents the number of paths from the top-left cell (1, 1)

  The problem is asking you to decrypt a string that has been encrypted using the given algorithm. The algorithm reverses the substring of the string starting at position 1 and ending at position d for each divisor d of the length of the string.

To solve this problem, you need to find the original string that was encrypted. One way to do this is to apply the algorithm in reverse, starting from the length of the string and working backwards. For each divisor d of the length of the string, you can find the original substring by reversing the substring of the encrypted string starting at position 1 and ending at position d.

For example, if the encrypted string is "rocesfedoc" and the length of the string is 10, you can find the original substring by reversing the substring of the encrypted string starting at position 1 and ending at position 5, which is "rocesf". Then, you can find the original substring for the next divisor, which is 6, by reversing the substring of the encrypted string starting at position 6 and ending at position 10, which is "edoc".

Once you have found the original substring for each divisor, you can

Here is an example of how to solve this problem in Python:

In this example, we first read the input as two integers, A and B, using the `input()` function and the `split()` method to separate the two integers. We then convert the two integers to integers using the `int()` function and add them together using the `+` operator. Finally, we print the sum using the `print()` function.

* '+' to increment the value at the current data pointer
* '-' to decrement the value at the current data pointer

We can use these commands to generate a Brainfuck program that prints the given integer. For example, if the integer is 10, we can generate the following Brainfuck program:

We can solve this problem by using a brute force approach. We can iterate through all the numbers between 1 and N (inclusive) and check if each number is a Shichi-Go-San number. If a number is a Shichi-Go-San number, we can count it as one.

  The problem is asking for the minimum number of tiles that need to be repainted so that any two adjacent tiles have different colors.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that checks each tile and its adjacent tiles to see if they have the same color. If they do, we can repaint one of the tiles to make them different colors.

We can start by checking the first tile. If it is black, we can repaint it white. If it is white, we can do nothing.

Next, we check the second tile. If it is black, we can repaint it white. If it is white, we can repaint the first tile black.

We continue this process until we reach the end of the row. If we have reached the end of the row and we have not yet found a pair of adjacent tiles with different colors, we can repaint the last tile white.

The number of tiles that need to be repainted is the number of tiles that are not already white. Since we have already checked each tile and its adjacent tiles, we know that we can repaint at most N-1 tiles to make sure that any

  To solve this problem, we need to check if the string S satisfies both conditions.

Condition 1: Every character in an odd position (1-st, 3-rd, 5-th, 7-th) is R, U, or D.

We can check this by iterating through the characters of S and checking if they are R, U, or D. If any character is not R, U, or D, we can immediately return "No" because the string does not satisfy condition 1.

Condition 2: Every character in an even position (2-nd, 4-th, 6-th) is L, U, or D.

We can check this by iterating through the characters of S and checking if they are L, U, or D. If any character is not L, U, or D, we can immediately return "No" because the string does not satisfy condition 2.

If both conditions are satisfied, we can return "Yes" because the string S is easily playable.

3. There exists at least one element in the sequence that is equal to 9.

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of bitmasks and a dynamic programming approach.

Now, let's consider the case where N is greater than 1. We can divide the problem into two sub-problems:

  To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest prime number greater than or equal to X. We can do this by iterating through all prime numbers starting from 2 and checking if they are greater than or equal to X. If we find a prime number that is greater than or equal to X, we can print it and stop the loop. If we don't find any prime number that is greater than or equal to X, we can print -1.

Here's an example of how this solution would work:

3. Stop the loop.

Output: 23

We can start by analyzing the given sequence. We know that the sequence has an even number of elements, and that each element is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive. We also know that the sequence is not /\/\/\/, since it does not satisfy the first condition.

To make the sequence /\/\/\/, we need to replace some of its elements. We can start by looking at the first and last elements of the sequence. If the first element is not equal to the last element, we can replace the first element with the last element to make the sequence /\/\/\/.

For example, if the given sequence is 3,1,3,2, we can replace the first element 3 with the last element 2 to make it /\/\/\/.

However, if the first element is equal to the last element, we need to replace at least one of the elements in the middle of the sequence. We can do this by replacing the middle element with a different number.

Let's assume we have N = 5 bamboos with lengths l_1, l_2,..., l_N. We want to obtain three bamboos of lengths A, B, C.

To solve this problem, we can use a loop to iterate through each character of S and shift it by N in alphabetical order. We can use the modulo operator (%) to wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet if the character is shifted beyond Z.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let $f(i, j)$ be the number of different monotonic renumerations of the first $i$ elements of $a$ that end with $j$. Then, we have the following recurrence relation:

$$f(i, j) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } i = 1 \text{ and } j = 0 \\

  The problem is to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given sequence in order to make it "good". A good sequence is defined as follows: for each element $a_i$ in the sequence, there exists an element $a_j$ ($i \ne j$) such that $a_i+a_j$ is a power of two.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start by considering the first element of the sequence. If the first element is a power of two, then we can keep it in the sequence. Otherwise, we need to remove it.

Next, we consider the second element of the sequence. If the second element is a power of two, then we can keep it in the sequence. Otherwise, we need to remove it.

We continue this process until we reach the end of the sequence. If we have removed all the elements that are not powers of two, then we can keep the remaining elements in the sequence. Otherwise, we need to remove all the remaining elements that are not powers of two.

The key insight is that we can always find an element $a_j$ such that $a_i+a

  The problem is asking us to find the maximum number of cubes that can be removed from a stack of N cubes, where each cube has a color that is determined by the corresponding character in a given string S. The operation we can perform is to remove two adjacent cubes of different colors, and the cubes that fall down will be placed on top of the removed cubes.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by removing the two cubes that are at the bottom of the stack, since they are the only two cubes that we can remove. Then, we can continue to remove the next two cubes that are adjacent to the removed cubes, and so on.

We can keep track of the number of cubes that we have removed, and the number of cubes that we have left. We can stop removing cubes when we have removed all of the cubes from the stack, or when we have removed the maximum number of cubes that we can remove.

The maximum number of cubes that we can remove is the number of cubes that we have left, minus the number of cubes that we have removed. This is because we can only remove adjacent cub

  The problem is asking us to find the number of ID cards that allow us to pass all the gates alone. We are given N ID cards and M gates, and we can pass the i-th gate if we have one of the following ID cards: the L_i-th, (L_i+1)-th,..., and R_i-th ID cards.

To solve this problem, we can use a bitmask to keep track of which ID cards we have. We can initialize the bitmask with all 0s, which means we don't have any ID cards. Then, for each gate, we can check if we have the ID cards that allow us to pass that gate. If we have all the required ID cards, we can set the corresponding bits in the bitmask to 1.

After we have processed all the gates, we can count the number of 1s in the bitmask to get the number of ID cards that allow us to pass all the gates alone.

Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the bitmask with all 0s.

  The problem is to find the minimum number of watering operations required to satisfy the condition that the height of each flower in the flower bed is equal to the corresponding value in the input sequence.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by watering all flowers with height 0, and then repeatedly water the flowers with height 1, then the flowers with height 2, and so on.

We can keep track of the number of watering operations required by keeping a count of the number of flowers with each height. We can start with the flowers with height 0, and then gradually increase the height of the flowers as we water them.

The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of flowers in the flower bed. The space complexity is O(N), where N is the number of flowers in the flower bed.

The solution is:

1. Initialize a count array of size N, where each element is 0.
2. For each flower with height 0, increment the count of the corresponding height in the count array.
3. For each flower with height 1, increment the count of the corresponding height in the count

  The problem is asking for the number of possible ways that the number of passengers in the bus before the first bus stop can be determined, given the sequence of integers recorded by the video system. The video system records the number of passengers in the bus after each bus stop, and the bus has a capacity of $w$.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways that the number of passengers in the bus before the first bus stop can be determined, subject to the constraint that the number of passengers in the bus at any time must be between 0 and $w$.

We can approach this problem by considering all possible combinations of passengers in the bus before the first bus stop, and then counting the number of combinations that satisfy the constraint.

Let's consider a specific combination of passengers in the bus before the first bus stop. Let's say the combination is $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, where $x_i$ is the number of passengers in the bus before the $i$th bus stop.

We can determine the number of possible combinations of passengers in the bus before the first bus stop by considering all possible values of $x_1, x_2

  To solve this problem, we need to rearrange the given sequence in such a way that each number is either twice the previous number or one third of the previous number.

We can start by sorting the sequence in ascending order. This will ensure that the first number in the sequence is the smallest number, and the last number is the largest number.

Next, we can start iterating through the sequence from the second element to the last element. For each element, we can either multiply it by 2 or divide it by 3, depending on whether the previous element is twice the current element or one third of the current element.

For example, if the current element is 4, and the previous element is 9, we can either multiply 4 by 2 to get 8, or divide 9 by 3 to get 3. If we choose to multiply 4 by 2, then the next element in the sequence will be 8, and the previous element will be 9. If we choose to divide 9 by 3, then the next element in the sequence will be 3, and the previous element will be 9.

By following this process, we can construct a rearr

  The problem is to find the maximum possible number of points in a subset of the given set of points such that the distance between each pair of points in the subset is an integral power of two.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by selecting the point with the smallest coordinate as the first point in our subset. Then, we can select the point with the next smallest coordinate that is closest to the previous point in our subset. We continue this process until we have selected all the points.

To determine the distance between each pair of points in our subset, we can use the formula:

|x_i - x_j| = 2^d

where d is the number of times we need to double the distance between the two points to get the required distance.

For example, if we have two points with coordinates 3 and 5, the distance between them is 2, so d = 1. If we have two points with coordinates 7 and 11, the distance between them is 4, so d = 2.

By following this greedy approach, we can ensure that the distance between each pair of points in our subset is an

  The problem is asking us to simulate the actions of Takahashi and Aoki for K times. The rules for the actions are as follows:

* If Takahashi has one or more cookies, eat one of his cookies.
* Otherwise, if Aoki has one or more cookies, eat one of Aoki's cookies.
* If they both have no cookies, do nothing.

We need to keep track of the number of cookies that Takahashi and Aoki have at each step. At the end of K steps, we need to print the number of cookies that Takahashi and Aoki have, respectively.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can solve this problem:

1. Read the input: The input consists of three integers A, B, and K, which represent the number of cookies that Takahashi and Aoki have, and the number of actions that Takahashi will perform, respectively.
2. Initialize the variables: We need to initialize two variables, `takahashi` and `aoki`, to keep track of the number of cookies that Takahashi and Aoki have, respectively. We can initialize them to 0.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of years it takes for Takahashi's balance to reach X yen or above for the first time.

We know that the annual interest rate is 1% and it is compounded annually. We also know that the balance after one year is 101 yen.

We can start by assuming that the balance after one year is 100 yen, since the interest rate is 1% and the balance is 100 yen. This means that the interest for the first year is 1 yen.

For the second year, we can assume that the balance is 101 yen, since the interest for the first year is 1 yen and the balance is 100 yen. This means that the interest for the second year is 1 yen.

For the third year, we can assume that the balance is 102 yen, since the interest for the first two years is 2 yen and the balance is 100 yen. This means that the interest for the third year is 2 yen.

We can continue this pattern by assuming

  The problem is to find the sum of the greatest common divisors of all possible triples of integers from 1 to K, where K is a given integer between 1 and 200.

To solve this problem, we can use a nested loop to iterate over all possible triples of integers from 1 to K. For each triple, we can calculate the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
2. Iterate over all possible triples of integers from 1 to K using nested loops.
3. For each triple, calculate the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.
4. Add the calculated greatest common divisor to the `sum` variable.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all possible triples have been considered.
6. Print the value of `sum`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(K^3), since we need to iterate over all possible triples of integers from 1 to K. The space complexity is O(1), since we only need to store the `sum` variable.

To find the maximum value of f, we need to find the maximum value of the sum of the remainders of m divided by each of the integers a_1, a_2,..., a_N.

We can do this by considering the following:

* For a given integer m, the sum of the remainders of m divided by each of the integers a_1, a_2,..., a_N is equal to the sum of the remainders of m divided by the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers a_1, a_2,..., a_N.

2. Initialize a counter to 0.

Note that this solution assumes that the input is valid, meaning that the rolls are between 1 and 6, and that there are at least 3 rolls.

  The problem is asking how many times the area of a circle of radius r is larger than the area of a circle of radius 1. To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the area of the two circles.

The area of a circle can be calculated using the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. So, if we want to find the ratio of the area of a circle of radius r to the area of a circle of radius 1, we can simply divide the area of the circle of radius r by the area of the circle of radius 1.

The area of a circle of radius 1 is A1 = π(1)^2 = π, and the area of a circle of radius r is A2 = π(r)^2. So, the ratio of the area of the two circles is A2/A1 = π(r)^2/π = r^2.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is r^2.

  To determine if an N-sided polygon with sides of length L_1, L_2,..., L_N can be drawn in a two-dimensional plane, we can use the following theorem:

Theorem: an N-sided polygon satisfying the condition can be drawn if and only if the longest side is strictly shorter than the sum of the lengths of the other N-1 sides.

To apply this theorem, we need to find the longest side of the polygon and compare it to the sum of the lengths of the other N-1 sides. If the longest side is strictly shorter than the sum of the lengths of the other N-1 sides, then the polygon can be drawn on a plane.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input: The first line of input contains an integer N, which is the number of sides of the polygon. The next N lines contain the lengths of the sides of the polygon.

  The problem is asking us to find the smallest non-negative integer that has exactly N digits in base 10 and satisfies the given conditions.

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of mathematical induction and a binary search algorithm.

First, we can prove that the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies the conditions is greater than or equal to 10^N - 1. This is because we can always add a digit to the left of the integer, and the new integer will still satisfy the conditions. Therefore, the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies the conditions is greater than or equal to 10^N - 1.

Next, we can use a binary search algorithm to find the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies the conditions. We can start by setting the lower bound to 10^N - 1 and the upper bound to 10^N. We can then repeatedly divide the upper bound by 10 and check if the resulting integer satisfies the conditions. If it does, we can set the upper bound to the resulting integer. If it doesn't, we can set the lower bound to the resulting integer.

Once we have found the smallest non-negative integer that

  The problem is to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of positive integers not greater than N such that a + b, b + c, and c + a are all multiples of K.

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of modular arithmetic and the fact that the sum of two multiples of K is also a multiple of K.

We can start by considering the case where a = b = c. In this case, we have a + b + c = 3K, which is a multiple of K. Therefore, there are K such triples.

Next, we consider the case where a = b and c = 1. In this case, we have a + b + c = 2K, which is also a multiple of K. Therefore, there are K such triples.

Now, we consider the case where a = 1 and b = c. In this case, we have a + b + c = 2K, which is also a multiple of K. Therefore, there are K such triples.

Finally, we consider the case where a = b = c = 1. In this case, we have

  To solve this problem, we need to find the base -2 representation of N. We can do this by finding the binary representation of N and then reversing it.

First, we need to find the binary representation of N. We can do this by dividing N by 2 and taking the remainder. We can repeat this process until we reach 0.

For example, if N = -9, we can start by dividing it by 2 to get -9 / 2 = -4 with a remainder of 1. We can then divide -4 by 2 to get -4 / 2 = -2 with a remainder of 0. We can then divide -2 by 2 to get -2 / 2 = -1 with a remainder of 0. Finally, we can divide -1 by 2 to get -1 / 2 = 0 with a remainder of 1.

So, the binary representation of -9 is 1011.

Now, we need to reverse the binary representation to get the base -2 representation of N. We can do this by reversing the order of the digits in the binary representation.

Let's consider the second store. We can buy at most B_2 cans of energy drinks for A_2 yen each. If we buy M cans of energy drinks, we need to spend at least M \* A_2 yen.

Since we have N stores, we need to find the minimum amount of money that we can spend to buy M cans of energy drinks from all N stores. We can do this by finding the minimum amount of money that we need to spend to buy M cans of energy drinks from each store.

Let's call the minimum amount of money that we need to spend to buy M cans of energy drinks from each store "x". We can calculate x as follows:

  The problem is asking you to find the maximum number of times you can move from a given square to the right, while maintaining the condition that the height of the next square is not greater than that of the current square.

To solve this problem, you can use a dynamic programming approach. Let dp[i] be the maximum number of times you can move from the i-th square to the right, while maintaining the condition. Then, dp[i] = 1 + dp[i+1] if the height of the i+1-th square is not greater than that of the i-th square, and dp[i] = 0 otherwise.

The base case is dp[N] = 0, since you cannot move from the last square to the right.

The answer is dp[1], which is the maximum number of times you can move from the first square to the right.

In the sample input, the maximum number of times you can move is 2, since you can move from the third square to the right twice.

  The problem is to find the minimum number of operations required to make at least $k$ elements in the array equal. The only difference between the easy and hard versions is the number of elements in the array.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start with the first element of the array and divide it by 2. If the result is 0, we move on to the next element. If the result is not 0, we repeat the process until we reach the desired number of equal elements.

For example, let's say we have an array of 5 elements and we want to make at least 3 elements equal. We start with the first element and divide it by 2. If the result is 0, we move on to the next element. If the result is not 0, we repeat the process until we reach the desired number of equal elements.

We can use a variable to keep track of the number of equal elements we have reached. If the variable is equal to or greater than $k$, we stop the process. If the variable is less than $k$, we continue the process until we reach the desired number of equal elements.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can maintain a count of the number of equal elements in the array, and for each move, we can either increase or decrease the value of a single element in the array.

We can start by sorting the array in non-decreasing order. We can then iterate through the array and for each element, we can either increase or decrease its value by 1. We can keep track of the number of equal elements in the array and update it accordingly.

We can continue this process until we have at least $k$ equal elements in the array. The minimum number of moves required to make at least $k$ elements equal in the array is the number of moves required to make all the elements equal.

The time complexity of this approach is $O(n \log n)$ and the space complexity is $O(1)$.

In this case, Polycarp can buy $n/2$ bottles of the first type and $n/2$ bottles of the second type, which costs $a$ burles and $b$ burles, respectively. Therefore, the total cost is $a\times\frac{n}{2} + b\times\frac{n}{2} = \frac{n}{2}(a+b)$.

Now, let's consider the case where $n$ is not a multiple of 2. In this case, we can buy $n/2$ bottles of the first type and $n/2-1$ bottles of the second type, which costs $a$ burles and $b$ burles, respectively. Therefore, the total cost is $a\times\frac{n

We can then find the number of times the ball will make a bounce where the coordinate is less than or equal to X by counting the number of times the sum of the distances traveled on each bounce is less than or equal to X.

Next, we need to check if the second word, W_2, satisfies the condition that its first character is the same as the last character of the last word announced, which is W_1. If it does not satisfy this condition, then the game is not possible.

We continue this process for each word, W_i, until we reach the last word, W_N. If any word does not satisfy the conditions, then the game is not possible.

If all the words satisfy the conditions, then the game is possible. Therefore, we print "Yes" if the game is possible, and "No" if it is not.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by considering the first square and then iterate through the remaining squares. For each square, we can either decrease the height by 1 or do nothing.

If we decrease the height of a square, we need to make sure that the height of the next square is greater than or equal to the current height. If the next square's height is less than the current height, then we cannot perform the operation and we need to move on to the next square.

If we do nothing, we can simply move on to the next square.

If we are able to perform the operations in this way, then we can print Yes, otherwise we can print No.

The next N lines contain the coordinates of the cities controlled by Empire A. The last M lines contain the coordinates of the cities controlled by Empire B.

The problem is asking us to determine if there exists an integer Z that satisfies all of the following three conditions:

1. X < Z \leq Y
2. x_1, x_2,..., x_N < Z
3. y_1, y_2,..., y_M \geq Z

If there exists such an integer Z, then the two empires will come to an agreement. Otherwise, war will break out.

The constraints on the input are as follows:

  The problem is asking us to find the smallest time t such that the hands of all N clocks point directly upward again. We can solve this problem by using the least common multiple (LCM) of the time it takes for each clock to point directly upward.

Let T_i be the time it takes for the i-th clock to point directly upward. We can find the LCM of T_1, T_2,..., T_N using the following formula:

LCM(T_1, T_2,..., T_N) = T_1 \* T_2 \*... \* T_N / GCD(T_1, T_2,..., T_N)

where GCD(T_1, T_2,..., T_N) is the greatest common divisor of T_1, T_2,..., T_N.

In this case, we have N = 2, T_1 = 2, T_2 = 3, so we can calculate the LCM as follows:

LCM(2, 3) = 2 \* 3 / GCD

  The problem is to find the minimum absolute difference between the sum of the weights of the first T weights and the sum of the weights of the remaining weights.

To solve this problem, we can consider all possible divisions of the weights into two groups, where the first group contains the first T weights and the second group contains the remaining weights.

For each division, we can calculate the sum of the weights in each group and the absolute difference between the two sums. We can then find the minimum absolute difference among all possible divisions.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N^2), since we need to consider all possible divisions of the weights. The space complexity is O(N), since we need to store the weights in an array.

In Python, we can implement this solution as follows:
```
def solve(weights, T):
    # Calculate the sum of the weights in each group
    group1_sum = sum(weights[:T])
    group2_sum = sum(weights[T:])

    # Calculate the absolute difference between the two sums

  The problem is to find the minimum number of moves required to transform a given rectangular matrix into a specific target matrix. The matrix is described by its size $n \times m$ and its elements $a_{i, j}$ ($1 \le i, j \le n, m$). The goal is to obtain the target matrix, where $a_{1, 1} = 1, a_{1, 2} = 2, \dots, a_{1, m} = m, a_{2, 1} = m + 1, a_{2, 2} = m + 2, \dots, a_{n, m} = n \cdot m$ ($a_{i, j} = (i - 1)m + j$).

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can define a function $f(i, j)$ that represents the minimum number of moves required to transform the submatrix $A[1..i, 1..j]$ into the target matrix.

We can use the following recurrence relation to compute $f(i, j)$:

  The problem is to find the minimum number of problems that each student should solve to form exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ teams, where $n$ is even and the $i$-th student has programming skill equal to $a_i$.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We can start by sorting the students in non-decreasing order of their programming skills.

Let $i$ be the index of the $i$-th student. We can form teams with students $i$ and $i+1$ if their skills are equal. We can also form teams with students $i$ and $i+2$ if their skills are equal.

We can repeat this process until we have formed all the teams. The total number of problems that each student should solve is the sum of the number of problems that each student should solve to form a team.

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n\log n)$ because we need to sort the students in non-decreasing order of their programming skills. The space complexity is $O(1)$ because we only need to store the sorted array of students.

The algorithm is correct because we have shown that

  The problem is asking for the maximum number of continuous hours during which Polycarp rests. The input is a sequence of $n$ integers, where each integer is either $0$ or $1$, indicating whether the corresponding hour is a rest hour or a working hour. The goal is to find the maximum number of continuous rest hours.

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window technique. We can maintain a window of size $n$ that contains the current sequence of rest hours. We can start the window at the beginning of the sequence and move it forward one hour at a time. At each step, we check if the current window contains the maximum number of continuous rest hours. If it does, we update the maximum number of continuous rest hours.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Initialize the window to contain the first $n$ hours of the sequence.
2. Check if the current window contains the maximum number of continuous rest hours. If it does, update the maximum number of continuous rest hours.
3. Move the window forward one hour.
4. Repeat step 2 until the end of the sequence is reached.

  The problem is asking you to find the number of facts that are true for a given input. The input is an integer between 1 and 16, and the output is a single integer that represents the number of facts that are true.

To solve this problem, you need to go through the list of facts and check which ones are true for the given input. You can use a loop to iterate through the facts and check each one. If a fact is true, you can increment a counter to keep track of the number of true facts.

Here's an example of how you can solve this problem:
```
def solve(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i == 1:
            count += 1

  The problem is to find the number of different types of cheese you have.

To solve this problem, we need to read in the input, which consists of a number of lines, each describing a cheese. Each line contains the name of the cheese and its type, which is either "soft" or "hard".

We can store the names and types of the cheeses in a data structure, such as a dictionary or a list of tuples. We can then iterate through the list of cheeses and count the number of different types of cheese.

Once we have counted the number of different types of cheese, we can output the result.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Python:
```
cheeses = []

# Read in the input
for _ in range(int(input())):
    cheeses.append(input().split())

# Count the number of different types of cheese

  The problem is to find the lexicographically minimum possible array $c$ such that the $i$-th element of $c$ is $(a_i + b_i) \% n$, where $a$ and $b$ are two given arrays of length $n$. The goal is to reorder the elements of $b$ to obtain the lexicographically minimum possible array $c$.

To solve this problem, we can first sort the elements of $b$ in non-decreasing order. Then, we can iterate through the elements of $b$ and update the corresponding elements of $c$ accordingly.

Let $c_i$ be the $i$-th element of $c$. We have $c_i = (a_i + b_i) \% n$. Since $a$ and $b$ are both arrays of length $n$, we know that $a_i$ and $b_i$ are both between $0$ and $n-1$. Therefore, we can compute $c_i$ as follows:

  The problem is to find the majority element in an array of 4 elements. The majority element is an element that appears more than half of the time in the array.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm called the "Boyer-Moore majority vote" algorithm. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize a counter to 0.
2. For each element in the array, if the element is 0, increment the counter by 1. If the element is 1, decrement the counter by 1.
3. If the counter is greater than 0, the majority element is 0. If the counter is less than 0, the majority element is 1.

In the example input, the counter starts at 0. When we encounter the first 0, we increment the counter by 1, so the counter is now 1. When we encounter the second 1, we decrement the counter by 1, so the counter is now 0. Since the counter is 0, the majority element is 0.

Therefore, the output is 0.

  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Takahashi to reach the place. We know that he will leave his house now and go straight to the place at a speed of S meters per minute. We also know that he will meet Aoki at a place that is D meters away from Takahashi's house in T minutes from now.

We can calculate the time it takes for Takahashi to reach the place by dividing the distance by the speed. We get:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is D meters and the speed is S meters per minute. We can plug these values into the formula to get:

Time = D / S

We know that Takahashi will meet Aoki at a place that is D meters away from Takahashi's house in T minutes from now. We can calculate the time it takes for Takahashi to reach the place by subtracting the time it takes for him to reach the house from the total time he has to meet Aoki. We get:

Time to reach place = T - (D / S)

We can simplify this expression by multiplying both sides by S to

  To solve this problem, we need to check if there are three marked numbers in a row, column, or diagonal on the bingo card.

We can do this by keeping track of the numbers that have been marked on the card. When a number is chosen by the MC, we check if it is already marked on the card. If it is, we mark it again. If it is not, we mark it and check if it is part of a row, column, or diagonal that contains three marked numbers.

We can use a 2D array to keep track of the numbers that have been marked on the card. The array will have a size of 100 x 100, since the maximum value of A_{i, j} is 100.

We can use a for loop to iterate through the numbers that have been chosen by the MC. For each number, we check if it is already marked on the card. If it is, we mark it again. If it is not, we mark it and check if it is part of a row, column, or diagonal that contains three marked numbers.

  The problem is asking for the maximum number of days Takahashi can spend hanging out during his summer vacation if he finishes all his summer assignments. The constraints are that he has N days of vacation, M summer assignments, and each assignment takes A_i days to complete.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of days Takahashi can hang out during his vacation while still completing all his assignments. We can do this by finding the minimum number of days he needs to spend on each assignment.

Let's say he needs to complete the first assignment in A_1 days. If he spends A_1 days on the first assignment, he will have N - A_1 days left for hanging out. If he spends A_2 days on the second assignment, he will have N - A_1 - A_2 days left for hanging out.

We can continue this process for each assignment, finding the minimum number of days he needs to spend on each assignment. Let's call this minimum number of days for each assignment "x_i".

We can then find the maximum number of days Takahashi can hang out by adding

  To solve this problem, we need to find the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times.

If D is 0, then the integer must be divisible by 100 exactly 0 times, which means it must be a multiple of 100. The smallest such integer is 100, and the N-th smallest integer is 100.

If D is 1, then the integer must be divisible by 100 exactly 1 time, which means it must be a multiple of 10. The smallest such integer is 10, and the N-th smallest integer is 10.

If D is 2, then the integer must be divisible by 100 exactly 2 times, which means it must be a multiple of 1000. The smallest such integer is 1000, and the N-th smallest integer is 1000.

Therefore, the N-th smallest integer that would make Ringo happy is 100 if D is 0, 10 if D is 1, and 1000 if

  To solve this problem, we need to reconstruct the order in which the students entered the classroom based on the information provided in the input.

We are given N students, each with a unique student number from 1 to N. We are also given the number of students in the classroom when each student entered the classroom, including the student number of the student who entered the classroom.

We can start by sorting the input based on the student number of the student who entered the classroom. This will give us the order in which the students entered the classroom.

For example, if the input is:

3
2 3 1

We can sort the input as follows:

1 2 3

This means that student number 1 entered the classroom first, followed by student number 2, and finally student number 3.

Therefore, the output should be:

3 1 2

This is the order in which the students entered the classroom.

  The problem is asking us to find the largest integer that can be bought by Takahashi when he has X yen. The shop sells integers from 1 to 10^9, and the price of each integer is A times the integer plus B times the number of digits in the decimal notation of the integer.

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest integer that can be bought when we have X yen. We can do this by finding the largest integer that is less than or equal to X, and then checking if it can be bought.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Find the largest integer that is less than or equal to X. This can be done by finding the largest integer that is less than or equal to X divided by (A + B).
2. Check if the largest integer found in step 1 can be bought. This can be done by checking if the price of the integer is less than or equal to X.
3. If the integer can be bought, print it. If it cannot be bought, print 0.

  The problem is asking us to find the number of friends of Takahashi who can ride the roller coaster. The roller coaster requires a minimum height of K centimeters to ride. The height of each friend is given in the input.

We can solve this problem by using a simple algorithm. We can iterate through each friend and check if their height is greater than or equal to K. If it is, we can increment a counter to keep track of the number of friends who can ride the roller coaster.

Here's the pseudocode for the solution:

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of friends. The space complexity is O(1), as we only need to keep track of the counter.

  The problem is asking us to determine if we can select M popular items from a set of N items, where each item has a vote count. The catch is that we cannot select an item with less than 1/4M of the total number of votes.

To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of votes. We can do this by summing up the vote counts for each item. Let's call this total number of votes T.

Next, we need to find the number of votes for the most popular item. We can do this by finding the item with the highest vote count and then counting the number of votes for that item. Let's call this number of votes for the most popular item M.

Now, we need to check if we can select M popular items. We can do this by checking if the total number of votes is at least 4M. If the total number of votes is less than 4M, then we cannot select M popular items.

So, the solution is to first find the total number of votes and the number of votes for the most popular item. Then, we can check if we can select M popular items. If we can, then we

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to choose rows and columns such that the number of black squares in the chosen rows and columns is equal to K.

Let's consider a few examples to understand the problem better:

* If K = 0, then there is only one way to choose rows and columns: choose no rows and no columns.
* If K = 1, then there are two ways to choose rows and columns: choose the 1-st row and the 1-st column, or choose the 2-nd row and the 2-nd column.

In general, the number of ways to choose rows and columns such that the number of black squares in the chosen rows and columns is equal to K is

Next, we need to check if there is exactly one occurrence of C between the third character from the beginning and the second to last character (inclusive). We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of 'C' in the string. If the count is 1, then we have exactly one occurrence of 'C'.

Finally, we need to check if all the letters except the A and C mentioned above are lowercase. We can do this by checking if all the characters in the string are lowercase.

If all the conditions are satisfied, then we print AC. Otherwise, we print WA.

Now, let's find the length of the string after 5 \times 10^{15} days. We can do this by counting the number of times each digit appears in the string.

For example, if S is 1324, it becomes 1333224444 the next day, and it becomes 133333333322224444444444444444 the day after next.

  The problem is asking you to determine if it is possible to sort a given permutation of the numbers 1 to N in ascending order by performing at most one swap operation.

To solve this problem, you can use a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start with the first element of the permutation and compare it to the next element. If the next element is smaller, then you can swap them. If the next element is larger, then you cannot swap them.

After the first swap, you can continue comparing the next element to the next element after that, and so on. If you reach the end of the permutation without swapping any elements, then you can print YES, because you have sorted the permutation in ascending order.

If you reach the end of the permutation and you have not swapped any elements, then you can print NO, because you cannot sort the permutation in ascending order.

Here is an example of how you can implement this algorithm:

  The problem is asking for the maximum number of numbers that can be obtained by cutting a given number $s$ into parts, where each part is divisible by 3.

To solve this problem, we can start by analyzing the number $s$ and finding the number of digits that are divisible by 3. We can do this by counting the number of digits that are either 3, 6, 9, or 12.

For example, if the number $s$ is 3121, we can see that the number 3 is divisible by 3, and the numbers 6, 9, and 12 are not divisible by 3. Therefore, the number of digits that are divisible by 3 in $s$ is 1.

Next, we can consider the number of parts that we can obtain by cutting $s$ into parts. We can do this by making vertical cuts between pairs of adjacent digits. For example, if we cut $s$ into parts with two cuts, we can obtain two parts: 312 and 1. Each of these parts is divisible by 3, so we have obtained two numbers that

  The problem is to find the maximum number of zeroes in an array $c$ that is created by multiplying two other arrays $a$ and $b$ by a real number $d$. The goal is to maximize the number of zeroes in $c$.

To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal value of $d$ that maximizes the number of zeroes in $c$.

Let's consider the value of $d$ that maximizes the number of zeroes in $c$. We can see that if $d$ is a positive integer, then the product $d \cdot a_i + b_i$ will always be non-zero, so the number of zeroes in $c$ will be zero.

On the other hand, if $d$ is a negative integer, then the product $d \cdot a_i + b_i$ will be zero if and only if $a_i$ is an integer multiple of $d$. Therefore, the number of zeroes in $c$ will be equal to the number of elements in $a$ that are integer multiples of $d$.

Therefore, the optimal value of $d$ is the

  This problem is a classic problem in combinatorics, known as the "Colored Boots" problem. The problem is to find the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.

To solve this problem, we need to first understand the concept of compatibility between colors. A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.

For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').

Once we understand the concept of compatibility, we can start solving the problem. We can start by creating a matrix of size $n \times n$, where $n$ is the number of boots. Each element of the matrix represents the compatibility between two boots. If two boots are compatible, then the corresponding element in

  This problem is a classic problem in combinatorics, known as the "Partition Problem". The goal is to partition a set of $n$ elements into a maximum number of blocks such that each block has the same sum.

The solution to this problem is to use a greedy algorithm. We start by sorting the elements in non-decreasing order. Then, we start with the first element and add it to the current block. We continue adding elements to the current block until we reach the end of the array or until we reach an element that is not equal to the current block's sum. If we reach the end of the array, we add the current block to the set of blocks.

We repeat this process until we have added all the elements to the set of blocks. The final set of blocks is the solution to the problem.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. Sort the elements in non-decreasing order.
2. Initialize the current block to be empty.
3. For each element in the array, do the following:

To solve this problem, we can use a brute force approach. We can iterate through all possible pairs of positions $(i, j)$ and check if the concatenation of $a_i$ and $a_j$ is divisible by $k$. If it is, we increment a counter.

The time complexity of this approach is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the array. The space complexity is $O(1)$, since we only need to store a single counter.

However, this approach is not efficient for large inputs. A more efficient approach would be to use a hash table to keep track of the divisibility of each number by $k$. We can iterate through the array once and for each number, we can check if it is divisible by $k$ and if so, we can increment a counter.

The time complexity of this approach is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the

  The problem is to find the maximum possible sum of the elements of a sequence A of length N, where the sequence B of length N-1 is known to satisfy the constraint that B_i ≥ max(A_i, A_{i+1}).

To solve this problem, we can start by considering the first element of A, which is A_1. Since B_1 ≥ max(A_1, A_2), we know that A_1 ≤ B_1. Therefore, the maximum possible sum of the elements of A is at most B_1 + A_2 +... + A_N.

Now, let's consider the second element of A, which is A_2. Since B_2 ≥ max(A_2, A_3), we know that A_2 ≤ B_2. Therefore, the maximum possible sum of the elements of A is at most B_1 + B_2 + A_3 +... + A_N.

We can continue this process for each element of A, considering the constraint that B_i ≥ max(A_i, A_{i+1}). This means that the maximum possible sum of

  The problem is asking us to find the maximum possible score of a sequence A, given that it satisfies certain conditions. The conditions are as follows:

* A is a sequence of N positive integers.
* 1 <= A_1 <= A_2 <=... <= A_N <= M.
* Let us define a score of this sequence as the sum of d_i over all indices i such that A_{b_i} - A_{a_i} = c_i. If there is no such i, the score is 0.

The input consists of four lines:

* The first line contains three integers N, M, and Q, separated by spaces.
* The second line contains Q quadruples of integers (a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i), separated by spaces.

The output is a single integer, the maximum possible score of A.

The constraints are as follows:

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 <= N <= 10
* 1 <= M <= 10
* 1 <= Q <= 50

  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum absolute difference between two elements in the array A. We can do this by iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum absolute difference we have seen so far.

We start by initializing a variable maxDiff to 0, which will store the maximum absolute difference we have seen so far. We then iterate through the array A, starting from the first element. For each element A_i, we compare it to the previous element A_i-1. If the absolute difference between the two elements is greater than maxDiff, we update maxDiff to the new maximum absolute difference.

We continue this process until we have iterated through the entire array. At the end, we return the maximum absolute difference we have seen, which is stored in the variable maxDiff.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the length of the array A. The space complexity is O(1), since we only need to keep track of the maximum absolute difference we have seen so far.

  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average length of all possible paths that visit all N towns.

First, we need to calculate the distance between each pair of towns. We can do this by calculating the Euclidean distance between each pair of towns, which is given by the formula:

distance = sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)

where x1, y1, x2, and y2 are the coordinates of the two towns.

Next, we need to calculate the length of each path. We can do this by summing up the distances between each pair of towns in the path. For example, if we have a path that goes from town 1 to town 2 to town 3, the length of the path would be:

distance(1, 2) + distance(2, 3)

We can calculate the average length of all possible paths by dividing the sum of the lengths of all paths by the number of possible paths.

The number of possible paths is N! (N factorial), which is equal to N × (N - 1) × (N - 2) ×...

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum horizontal length of the uncovered part of the window.

Let's call the horizontal length of the uncovered part of the window "x".

We know that the total horizontal length of the uncovered part of the window is equal to the horizontal length of the window minus the sum of the horizontal lengths of the two curtains.

So, we can write the equation:

x + B = A

where B is the horizontal length of one of the curtains.

We can solve for x by subtracting B from both sides of the equation:

x = A - B

So, the total horizontal length of the uncovered part of the window is equal to A - B.

Therefore, the output is A - B.

  The problem is asking for the minimum value of the function F(A,B) over all pairs of positive integers (A,B) such that N = A \* B.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum value of F(A,B) as (A,B) ranges over all pairs of positive integers such that N = A \* B.

Let's first define the function F(A,B):

F(A,B) = max(log10(A), log10(B))

where log10(x) is the base-10 logarithm of x.

Now, let's find the minimum value of F(A,B) as (A,B) ranges over all pairs of positive integers such that N = A \* B.

We know that N = A \* B, so we can write:

log10(N) = log10(A) + log10(B)

We also know that log10(A) and log10(B) are both non-negative, so we can take the maximum of them:

  This problem is a classic example of a "Voting Problem" where we have a set of candidates (foods) and a set of voters (people). Each voter has a preference for a set of candidates, and we want to find the number of candidates that are preferred by all the voters.

To solve this problem, we can use a technique called "Sorting and Counting". We can sort the preferences of each voter in non-decreasing order, and then count the number of unique candidates that are preferred by all the voters.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input: The first line of the input contains two integers N and M, which represent the number of voters and the number of candidates, respectively. The next M lines contain the preferences of each voter.
2. Sort the preferences: Sort the preferences of each voter in non-decreasing order.
3. Count the unique candidates: Count the number of unique candidates that are preferred by all the voters.
4. Print the result: Print the number of unique candidates that are preferred by all the voters.

  The problem is asking for the probability that Takahashi chooses an odd integer when choosing an integer from the positive integers not greater than N with equal probability.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of odd integers in the set of positive integers not greater than N.

Let's first consider the case where N is odd. In this case, there are N/2 odd integers in the set of positive integers not greater than N.

Now, let's consider the case where N is even. In this case, there are (N/2) odd integers in the set of positive integers not greater than N.

So, the probability that Takahashi chooses an odd integer is:

P = (N/2) / N

This is because the probability of choosing an odd integer is equal to the number of odd integers in the set of positive integers not greater than N divided by the total number of integers in the set.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is:

P = (N/2) / N

This is the probability that Takahashi chooses an odd integer when choosing an integer from the positive integers not greater than N with equal

  This problem is a classic example of a graph coloring problem. We can represent the people as nodes in a graph, and the testimonies as edges between the nodes. The goal is to color the nodes (i.e., assign a color to each person) such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by coloring the first person (Person 1) with color 1. Then, for each subsequent person, we check if it is consistent with the testimonies given by the previous people. If the person is consistent with the testimonies, we can color it with the same color as the previous person. If the person is not consistent with the testimonies, we need to find a new color that is not used by any of the previous people.

We can use a hash table to keep track of the colors used by the previous people. We initialize the hash table with an empty set of colors. For each person, we check if the color we want to assign to that person is already used by any of the previous people. If it is, we need to find a new color that is not used by any of the previous people

  The problem is to print a string that is either the original string or a modified version of it, depending on its length. If the length of the string is less than or equal to K, the original string should be printed without modification. However, if the length of the string exceeds K, the first K characters should be extracted, followed by the string "...", and the result should be printed.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple if-else statement to check the length of the string. If the length is less than or equal to K, we can print the original string without modification. If the length exceeds K, we can extract the first K characters, append "...", and print the result.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Python:
```
K = int(input())
S = input()

if len(S) <= K:
    print(S)
else:

In this example, we first read in the value of K and the string S from standard input. We then check the length of S using the len() function. If the length is less than or equal to K, we

  The problem is asking you to write a program that takes a single word in Taknese as input and outputs its plural form. The plural form of a Taknese word is formed by adding "s" to the end of the singular form if the singular form does not end with "s", and adding "es" to the end of the singular form if the singular form ends with "s".

To solve this problem, you can use a simple if-else statement to check if the singular form ends with "s" or not. If it ends with "s", you can add "es" to the end of the singular form to get the plural form. If it does not end with "s", you can add "s" to the end of the singular form to get the plural form.

Here is an example of how you can solve this problem:
```
def plural(word):
    if word.endswith("s"):
        return word + "es"
    else:

This function takes a single word as input and returns its plural form. It uses the `endswith()` method to check if the singular form

Takahashi will walk around the town and make mischief on the Snukes who have no snacks. We need to find the number of Snukes that will fall victim to Takahashi's mischief.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of Snukes that have no snacks. We can do this by finding the number of Snukes that have no Snack 1, the number of Snukes that have no Snack 2, and so on.

We can do this by using a loop to iterate through each Snuke and check if it has any Snack. If a Snuke has no Snack, we can add it to a list of Snukes that have no snacks.

  The problem is asking us to find the number of slimes after all the adjacent slimes with the same color have fused together.

We can solve this problem by keeping track of the number of slimes and the colors of the slimes. We can use a hash table to keep track of the colors of the slimes and their corresponding number.

We start by initializing the hash table with the colors of the first slime. We then iterate through the rest of the slimes, and for each slime, we check if the color of the current slime is already in the hash table. If it is, we increase the number of slimes with that color by 1. If it's not, we add the color of the current slime to the hash table with a count of 1.

After we've processed all the slimes, we can print the number of slimes by summing up the counts of all the colors in the hash table.

Here's an example of how this would work:

2. Choosing "multiply a_i by 3" for every i is not allowed.
3. The value of a_i after the operation must be an integer.

The solution is to perform the following operations:

1. Divide a_1 by 2 and multiply a_1 by 3.
2. Divide a_2 by 2 and multiply a_2 by 3.
3. Divide a_3 by 2 and multiply a_3 by 3.

This will result in the sequence {3, 2, 2}.

The maximum number of operations that Snuke can perform is 3.

For example, if we have 2 cards with 1s and one card with a 0, the sum of the numbers written on the cards is 2, which is the maximum possible value.

The solution is to sort the cards in descending order of the numbers written on them.

Then, we will pick up the first K cards and calculate the sum of the numbers written on them.

To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of numbers of cranes and turtles that satisfies the given statement.

Let's consider the statement "there are X animals in total in the garden, and they have Y legs in total".

If X = 2 and Y = 8, then there are two cranes and one turtle in the garden, and they have 8 legs in total. This satisfies the statement.

If X = 3 and Y = 8, then there are three cranes and one turtle in the garden, and they have 8 legs in total. This also satisfies the statement.

If X = 4 and Y = 8, then there are four cranes and one turtle in the garden, and they have 8 legs in total. This does not satisfy the statement, because there are only three cranes and one turtle

  The problem is to find the number of different paths that start from vertex 1 and visit all the vertices exactly once in an undirected unweighted graph with N vertices and M edges that contains neither self-loops nor double edges.

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. Let's define a function `countPaths(u)` that returns the number of different paths that start from vertex `u` and visit all the vertices exactly once. The base case is when `u` is the last vertex in the graph, in which case there is only one path that starts from `u` and visits all the vertices exactly once.

The recursive case is when `u` is not the last vertex in the graph. In this case, we need to find the number of different paths that start from `u` and visit all the vertices exactly once. We can do this by finding the number of different paths that start from each of the vertices that are connected to `u` and visit all the vertices exactly once.

We can use a DFS (Depth-First Search) algorithm to find the number of different paths that start from each of the vertices that are connected to `u`. We can

The flavor of the apple pie made of all the N apples is the sum of the flavors of the apples used. The flavor of the apple pie made of the remaining N-1 apples is the sum of the flavors of the apples used, minus the flavor of the apple that you eat.

To find the optimal choice, you want to minimize the absolute difference between the flavor of the apple pie made of all the N apples and the flavor of the apple pie made of the remaining N-1 apples. This means that you want to choose the apple to eat so that the flavor of the apple pie made of the remaining N-1 apples has the smallest possible absolute difference from the flavor of the apple pie made of all the N apples.

We can prove that this value is uniquely determined. Let's call the flavor of the apple pie made of all the N apples "f". Let's call the flavor of the apple pie made of the remaining N-1 apples "g".

To solve this problem, we can first find the set of integers not contained in the sequence p_1,..., p_N. This set can be obtained by taking the set of all integers between 1 and 100 and removing the elements in the sequence p_1,..., p_N.

Once we have the set of integers not contained in the sequence, we can find the nearest integer to X by finding the integer in the set that has the smallest absolute difference with X.

For example, if X = 6 and the sequence is 4, 7, 10, 6, 5, then the set of integers not contained in the sequence is {1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12,..., 99, 100}. The nearest integer to 6 in this set is 8.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from the string so that it becomes good.

A good string is defined as a string with an even length, and every character in an odd position is different from the next character. For example, the string "good" is good because it has an even length and the characters in odd positions are different from the next character.

To check if a string is good, we can use a simple algorithm that checks if the length of the string is even, and if the characters in odd positions are different from the next character. If the string is good, we can print the string as is, and print 0 as the number of characters that need to be deleted.

If the string is not good, we need to delete some characters from the string so that it becomes good. We can do this by deleting the characters in odd positions that are the same as the next character. For example, if the string "aabc" is not good, we can delete the character "b" from the string, so that it becomes "aaac".

The minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from the string is the number of characters that

  The problem is to find a directed graph with the same number of vertices and edges as the given undirected graph, such that no path of length two or greater exists in the directed graph.

To solve this problem, we can start by creating a directed graph with the same number of vertices and edges as the given undirected graph. We can do this by creating a directed edge between each pair of vertices in the undirected graph.

Next, we need to determine which edges should be directed from one vertex to another. We can do this by considering each edge in the undirected graph and determining whether it should be directed from one vertex to another. If the edge should be directed from one vertex to another, we can set the corresponding bit in the binary string to 0. If the edge should be directed from another vertex to the first vertex, we can set the corresponding bit in the binary string to 1.

Finally, we need to check whether the resulting directed graph contains any paths of length two or greater. If it does, we can print "NO" and stop. If it does not, we can print "YES" and the binary string representing the orientation of the edges.

  To solve this problem, we need to find all the points that do not belong to any segment. We can do this by first finding all the points that belong to at least one segment, and then finding the points that do not belong to any segment.

To find the points that belong to at least one segment, we can iterate through each segment and check if the point is between the left and right endpoints of the segment. If the point is between the endpoints, we can mark it as belonging to that segment.

Once we have marked all the points that belong to at least one segment, we can find the points that do not belong to any segment by iterating through all the points and checking if they have been marked as belonging to a segment. If a point has not been marked as belonging to a segment, we can print it as a point that does not belong to any segment.

The time complexity of this solution is $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of segments and $m$ is the upper bound for coordinates. The space complexity is $O(m)$, since we need to store all the points that belong to at least one segment.

Next, we can check if B is evenly divisible by C or D. If it is, we can add 1 to B and repeat the process.

Now, we can start iterating over the numbers between A and B (inclusive). For each number, we can check if it is evenly divisible by C or D. If it is, we can skip it and move on to the next number. If it is not, we can increment a counter to keep track of the number of integers that can be evenly divided by neither C nor D.

Finally, we can print the counter as the answer.

We can also see that the amounts are in the form of powers of 6 and 9, and the difference between each amount is 6^2 or 9^2.

To find the minimum number of operations required to withdraw exactly N yen in total, we can start by finding the minimum number of operations required to withdraw N yen in total using the amounts that are not in the form of powers of 6 and 9.

  The problem is asking you to determine if two strings, S and T, are equal after a rotation operation. The rotation operation involves reversing the order of the characters in the string.

For example, if the input strings are "kyoto" and "tokyo", the rotation operation would be to reverse the order of the characters in "kyoto", so the result would be "tokyo".

To solve this problem, you can simply perform the rotation operation on both strings and then compare them to see if they are equal. If the strings are equal after the rotation operation, then they are equal after rotation.

Here's an example of how you could solve this problem:

1. Read the input strings S and T from Standard Input.
2. Perform the rotation operation on both strings by reversing the order of the characters.
3. Compare the two rotated strings to see if they are equal. If they are equal, print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".

  The problem is to find the minimum number of characters in string S that need to be changed so that T is a substring of S.

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We start with an empty window, and then move the window along the string S, one character at a time.

At each position, we check if the characters in the window match the characters in T. If they do, we increment a counter to keep track of the number of characters that need to be changed.

If the characters in the window do not match T, we reset the counter to 0 and move the window to the next position.

Once we have processed the entire string S, we print the minimum number of characters that need to be changed.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of S. The space complexity is O(1), since we only need to keep track of a single counter.

To solve this problem, we can first find the prime factors of A and B. We can do this by finding the prime factors of each number and then finding the intersection of the two sets of prime factors.

Once we have the prime factors of A and B, we can find the K-th largest prime factor that divides both A and B. We can do this by sorting the prime factors in descending order and then selecting the K-th element.

Finally, we can print the K-th largest prime factor that divides both A and B.

Here is a step-by-step solution in words:

  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of happiness points that Takahashi can earn by exchanging his money.

First, let's consider the number of 500-yen coins that Takahashi can get. Since Takahashi has X yen, he can get 200 500-yen coins.

Next, let's consider the number of 5-yen coins that Takahashi can get. Since Takahashi has X yen, he can get 2000 5-yen coins.

Now, let's calculate the total number of happiness points that Takahashi can earn. For each 500-yen coin, he gains 1000 happiness points, and for each 5-yen coin, he gains 5 happiness points. Therefore, the total number of happiness points that Takahashi can earn is:

200 \* 1000 + 2000 \* 5 = 200000

Therefore, the maximum number of happiness points that Takahashi can earn is

  This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum total stamina that the first i people have to spend to attend a meeting at coordinate j.

We can fill in the dp array as follows:

* dp[0][j] = 0, since there are no people to attend the meeting.
* dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + (X_i - j)^2, if j is an integer.
* dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + (X_i - j)^2 + 1, if j is not an integer.

The reasoning behind this is as follows:

* If j is an integer, then the first i people can attend the meeting at coordinate j without spending any additional stamina. The total stamina spent by the first i people is dp[i-1][j-1], since the first i-1 people have already attended the meeting at coordinate j-1. The stamina spent by the i-th person is (

  The problem is asking for the minimum number of power strips required to extend Takahashi's house with A sockets into B or more empty sockets. The constraints are that A and B are both integers between 1 and 20, and that there are at least 2 sockets in each power strip.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of power strips required to extend Takahashi's house with A sockets into B or more empty sockets. We can do this by dividing the number of empty sockets by the number of sockets in each power strip.

Let's say we have B empty sockets and A sockets in each power strip. We can divide B by A to get the number of power strips required:

B = A x N

where N is the number of power strips required.

We want to find the minimum value of N, which means we want to find the smallest number of power strips that can extend Takahashi's house with A sockets into B or more empty sockets.

To find the minimum value of N, we can start with a small number of power strips and gradually

  The problem is asking you to find the number of days for which the forecast was correct. The forecast is given in the string S, and the actual weather is given in the string T. The forecast and actual weather are represented by the characters S, C, and R, respectively.

To solve this problem, you need to iterate through the characters of both strings and compare them. If the character in the forecast string matches the character in the actual weather string, then the forecast was correct for that day. You can use a counter to keep track of the number of correct forecasts.

Here's an example of how you can solve this problem:

1. Initialize a counter to 0.
2. Iterate through the characters of both strings.
3. If the character in the forecast string matches the character in the actual weather string, then increment the counter by 1.
4. Print the counter as the final answer.

For example, if the forecast string is "CSS" and the actual weather string is "CSR", then the correct forecasts are "C" and "S", so the counter should be incremented by 2. The final answer should be

  The problem is to find the number of elements in the permutation that satisfy the condition that they are the second smallest number among the three numbers on either side of them.

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We can start by iterating through the permutation from left to right, and for each element, we can check if it is the second smallest number among the three numbers on either side of it. If it is, we can increment a counter to keep track of the number of elements that satisfy the condition.

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Read the input: The first line of the input contains the number of points, n, and the next n lines contain the coordinates of the points.
2. Calculate the angle: For each pair of points, calculate the angle between the line connecting the two points and the x-axis. The angle can be calculated using the formula:

  This problem is a classic problem in dynamic programming. The idea is to find the minimum number of days it takes to write the coursework by considering all possible combinations of cups of coffee that Polycarp can drink.

Let's consider the case where Polycarp drinks $k$ cups of coffee during a day. The number of pages he can write during that day is given by the formula:

$$\text{pages} = \sum_{i=1}^k \max(0, a_i - i + 1)$$

where $a_i$ is the caffeine dosage of the $i$-th cup of coffee.

Now, let's consider the case where Polycarp drinks $k$ cups of coffee during $d$ days. The number of pages he can write during those $d$ days is given by the formula:

$$\text{pages} = \sum_{i=1}^k \max(0, a_i - i + 1) \cdot d$$

  The problem is to find the maximum number of copies of an array that can be cut out from another array. The given array $s$ consists of $n$ integers, and the desired array $t$ consists of $k$ integers. The goal is to find the array $t$ such that the maximum number of copies of $t$ can be cut out from $s$.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by selecting the first element of $t$ that is present in $s$. We can then remove all the copies of this element from $s$. We can repeat this process until we have used all the elements of $t$.

For example, if $s = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 1]$ and $t = [1, 2, 3]$, we can cut out two copies of $t$ from $s$. We can remove the first copy by using the elements $[1, \underline{\textbf{2}}, 3, 2, 4, \underline{\textbf{3}}, \underline{\textbf{1}}]$ (use the highlighted elements). After cutting out the first

A traversal is $k$-acceptable if for all $i$ ($1 \le i \le nm - 1$), the absolute difference between the numbers in the $i$th and $(i+1)$th cells is greater than or equal to $k$.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of $k$ such that there exists a row order of the matrix $a$ that produces a $k$-acceptable traversal. We can do this by considering all possible row orders of the matrix $a$ and checking whether each order produces a $k$-acceptable traversal.

Let $n$ and $m$ be the number of rows and columns of the matrix $a$, respectively. We can consider all possible row orders of the matrix $a$, which can be done in $n!$ ways. For each row order, we can traverse the matrix in the following way: first, we visit all cells of the first column from the top row to the bottom one, then we visit all cells of

  The problem is to find the minimum number of characters to remove from the file name so that the name does not contain the substring "xxx" as a substring. The file name can be modified by deleting any number of characters in arbitrary positions. The goal is to find the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the file name valid.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a table to store the minimum number of characters to remove for each substring of the file name. We can start by initializing the table with the length of the file name. We can then iterate through the file name and for each position, we can calculate the minimum number of characters to remove for the substring starting at that position. We can use a recursive formula to calculate the minimum number of characters to remove for each substring.

The recursive formula is:

min(i, j) = min(i - 1, j) if the substring starting at position i does not contain "xxx"
min(i, j) = min(i - 1, j - 1) + 1 if the substring starting at position i contains "xxx"

  To solve this problem, we need to find the area of a regular dodecagon inscribed in a circle of radius r. We know that the area of a regular dodecagon is 3a^2, where a is the radius of the circle.

We can start by assuming that the radius of the circle is a, and the area of the dodecagon is 3a^2. We can then use the formula for the area of a regular dodecagon to find the area of the dodecagon inscribed in a circle of radius r.

The formula for the area of a regular dodecagon is:

A = (3 \* (r/2))^2 \* sin(30 degrees)

We can substitute the value of r/2 for a in the formula to get:

A = (3 \* (r/2))^2 \* sin(30 degrees)
= (3 \* r/2)^2 \* sin(30 degrees)
= (3 \* r)^2 \* sin(30 degrees)

We can simplify the expression by multiplying both sides by sin(3

  The problem is asking us to determine whether the wolves will attack the sheep based on the number of wolves and sheep. We can solve this problem by using a simple logical statement.

If the number of wolves is greater than or equal to the number of sheep, then the wolves will attack the sheep. Therefore, we can print "unsafe" if the number of wolves is greater than or equal to the number of sheep.

On the other hand, if the number of wolves is less than the number of sheep, then the wolves will not attack the sheep. Therefore, we can print "safe" if the number of wolves is less than the number of sheep.

In summary, we can solve this problem by using the following steps:

1. Read the input from Standard Input in the format S W, where S is the number of sheep and W is the number of wolves.
2. Check if the number of wolves is greater than or equal to the number of sheep.
3. If the number of wolves is greater than or equal to the number of sheep, print "unsafe".

  To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the right triangle ABC. The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:

Area = (base × height) / 2

In this case, the base of the triangle is the length of the side opposite the 90-degree angle, which is |CA|. The height of the triangle is the length of the side adjacent to the 90-degree angle, which is |AB|.

So, we can calculate the area of the triangle as follows:

Area = (|CA| × |AB|) / 2

Since the area of the triangle is an integer, we can round the result of the calculation to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the solution to the problem is to read in the lengths of the three sides of the triangle from Standard Input, calculate the area of the triangle using the formula above, and print the rounded area to Standard Output.

  The problem is asking for the maximum number of times Takahashi can hear his favorite sound with the given amount of money.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of times Takahashi can hear the sound while still having enough money to buy the drink.

Let's break down the problem:

1. Takahashi has B yen.
2. He needs to spend A yen each time to hear the sound.
3. He wants to hear the sound at most C times.

We can start by finding the maximum number of times Takahashi can hear the sound without going over the limit. We can do this by dividing B by A:

B / A = C

This gives us the maximum number of times Takahashi can hear the sound:

C = B / A

Now, we need to find the number of times Takahashi can hear the sound while still having enough money to buy the drink. We can do this by rounding down the result of the division:

C = ⌊B / A⌋

This gives us the number of times Takahashi can hear the sound:

2. Store the values of A and B in two variables, say, a and b.
3. Compute the product of A and B using the multiplication operator, * or \*.

Here is the code in Python:

In this code, we first read the input from Standard Input using the input() function. We then split the input string into two parts using the split() function, where the delimiter is a space. We store the first part in the variable a and the second part in the variable b.

Next, we compute the product of A and B using the multiplication operator, * or \*. We store the result in the variable result.

Finally, we print the result as an integer

  To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of biscuits produced within T + 0.5 seconds after activation.

We know that the biscuit making machine produces B biscuits at the following moments: A seconds, 2A seconds, 3A seconds and each subsequent multiple of A seconds after activation.

We can start by finding the number of biscuits produced in the first T seconds after activation. We know that the machine produces B biscuits at the following moments: A seconds, 2A seconds, 3A seconds and each subsequent multiple of A seconds after activation.

So, we can calculate the number of biscuits produced in the first T seconds as follows:

1. Biscuits produced in the first A seconds: B
2. Biscuits produced in the first 2A seconds: 2B
3. Biscuits produced in the first 3A seconds: 3B
4. Biscuits produced in each subsequent multiple of A seconds: A biscuits

We can add up the number of biscuits produced in each of these intervals to find the total number of biscuits produced in the first T seconds

  To solve this problem, we need to find out if there is a multiple of K between A and B, where K is the carry distance.

We can start by checking if K is a multiple of A. If it is, then we know that K is a multiple of K, and we can print OK.

If K is not a multiple of A, then we need to find the next multiple of K that is greater than or equal to A. We can do this by dividing A by K and rounding up to the nearest integer. This will give us the next multiple of K that is greater than or equal to A.

Next, we need to check if this multiple is between A and B. If it is, then we know that K is a multiple of K, and we can print OK.

If this multiple is not between A and B, then we need to check if there is a multiple of K between A and B. We can do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of A and B, and then checking if K is a multiple of the GCD. If it is, then we know that K is a multiple of K, and we can print OK.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B.

We know that in World B, time passes X times as fast as it does in our world (World A). This means that if T hours pass in World B, (X \* T) hours will pass in World A.

We are given that Taro can leap to World B where time passes X times as fast as it does in our world. This means that if he studies for T hours in World A, he will leap to World B and study for (X \* T) hours.

Therefore, we can find the number of hours that will pass in World A by dividing the number of hours that will pass in World B by X. This will give us the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B.

So, the solution to the problem is to divide the number of hours that will pass in World B by X.

Next, we need to find the maximum amount of water that can be transferred from Bottle 2 to Bottle 1, which is the smaller of the two bottles' capacities and the amount of water in Bottle 2.

To solve this problem, we need to find the index of the permutation P in lexicographical order. We can do this by comparing the elements of P and Q.

Let's say we have two permutations P and Q, where P is the a-th lexicographically smallest permutation and Q is the b-th lexicographically smallest permutation. We can compare the elements of P and Q to find the index of P in lexicographical order.

We can do this by comparing the elements of P and Q one by one. If the elements of P and Q are equal, we move on to the next element. If the elements of P and Q are not equal, we know that P is lexicographically smaller than Q.

We can keep doing this until we reach the end of either P or Q. If we reach the end of P before Q, we know that P is lexicographically smaller than Q. If we reach the end of Q before P, we know that Q is lexicographically smaller than P.

We can do this by iterating through the characters of S and keeping track of the current ACGT string. If the current character is A, C, G, or T, we add it to the current ACGT string. If the current character is not A, C, G, or T, we reset the current ACGT string to an empty string. We continue this process until we reach the end of S.

Once we have found the longest ACGT string that is a substring of S, we print its length.

Here is an example of how this solution would work:

  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that have an odd number of digits.

We can start by considering the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that have an even number of digits. These numbers are the multiples of 10, such as 10, 20, 30,..., 10N.

The number of positive integers less than or equal to N that have an even number of digits is equal to the number of multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to N. This is because each multiple of 10 has an even number of digits.

To find the number of multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to N, we can use the formula:

10 * k <= N, where k is an integer.

We can solve this equation to find the largest integer k that satisfies the inequality. The largest integer k that satisfies the inequality is equal to the largest integer that is less than or equal to N/10.

Therefore, the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that have an even number of digits is equal

We can then print all the coordinates that potentially contain a black stone, in ascending order, with spaces in between. In this case, the coordinates are 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

We can then find the integer distance between the i-th point and the j-th point by rounding the length of the vector d_ij to the nearest integer. Let's call this rounded length r_ij.

The number of pairs (i, j) such that the distance between the i-th point and the j-th point is an integer is equal to the number of pairs (i, j) such that r_ij is an integer.

We can count the number of pairs (i, j) such that r_ij is an integer by considering the following cases:

  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of times the substring "ABC" appears in the given string "S" as contiguous subsequences.

We can do this by using a sliding window approach. We start at the beginning of the string "S" and move the window of size 3 (i.e., the substring "ABC") over the string. We check if the substring "ABC" is equal to the substring of the same size starting at the current position of the window. If it is, we increment the count of occurrences.

We continue moving the window over the string until we reach the end of the string. We then print the count of occurrences as the final answer.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

  To solve this problem, we need to check if the 3rd and 4th characters of the string are equal and if the 5th and 6th characters are also equal. We can do this by using a for loop to iterate through the characters of the string and check if the current character is equal to the character at the index 3 or 4, and also check if the current character is equal to the character at the index 5 or 6. If both conditions are true, then the string is coffee-like.

Here is the pseudocode for the solution:

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of whether the 3rd and 4th characters are equal.
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of whether the 5th and 6th characters are equal.
3. Iterate through the characters of the string using a for loop.
4. If the current character is equal to the character at the index 3 or 4, then set the variable to true.
5. If the current character is equal to the character at the index 5 or 6, then set the variable to true.
6. If both variables are true, then print Yes. Otherwise

  The problem is asking us to find the smallest cost of a route that takes not longer than time T. We are given N routes, each with a cost c_i and a time t_i. We need to find the smallest cost of a route that takes not longer than time T.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We can start by considering the first route. If the cost of the first route is less than or equal to T, then we can take this route. Otherwise, we need to consider the second route. If the cost of the second route is less than or equal to T, then we can take this route. Otherwise, we need to consider the third route and so on.

We can keep doing this until we have considered all the routes. If we have considered all the routes and none of them have a cost less than or equal to T, then we print TLE. Otherwise, we print the smallest cost of a route that takes not longer than time T.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of routes. The space complexity is O(1), since we only need to store the cost and time of each route.

  The problem is asking us to find the minimum total travel expense for a group of N people going on a trip by train or taxi. The train will cost each person A yen, and the taxi will cost a total of B yen.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum total travel expense that is possible by using the train and taxi. We can do this by finding the minimum total travel expense that is possible by using the train alone, and then adding the cost of the taxi to that total.

To find the minimum total travel expense that is possible by using the train alone, we need to find the minimum number of trips that we can take by train to cover the total cost of the trip. We can do this by dividing the total cost of the trip by the cost of one trip by train.

For example, if the total cost of the trip is 100 yen and the cost of one trip by train is 20 yen, we can take 5 trips by train to cover the total cost of the trip. The minimum total travel expense that is possible by using the train alone is 5 \* 20 =

  The problem is asking us to find the number of pairs of strings in the input that are anagrams of each other. We can solve this problem by creating a hash table that maps each string to a list of all the anagrams of that string.

Here's the algorithm:

1. Create a hash table called `anagrams` that maps each string to a list of all the anagrams of that string.
2. Iterate over the input strings and for each string, add it to the list of anagrams of its anagram.
3. Iterate over the input strings again and for each string, check if it is an anagram of any of the strings in the list of anagrams of its anagram. If it is, increment the count of anagrams.
4. Print the count of anagrams.

Here's the code:
```
# Create a hash table to store the anagrams

# Iterate over the input strings

  To solve this problem, we need to find the digit at the position $k$ of the sequence. We can do this by finding the block that contains the digit and then finding the position of the digit within that block.

Let's consider the first example. We have $q = 5$ queries, and each query consists of an integer $k$ between $1$ and $10^9$. We need to find the digit at position $k$ of the sequence.

For the first query, $k = 1$, we need to find the digit at position $1$ of the sequence, which is $1$.

  The problem is to find the minimum number of companies $r$ such that each road is assigned to one company, and the number of cities with two or more roads belonging to one company is at most $k$.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We can start by assigning each road to a company in a way that minimizes the number of cities with two or more roads belonging to one company. We can do this by assigning each road to the company that has the fewest number of roads already assigned.

We can keep track of the number of cities with two or more roads belonging to one company as we go along. If we assign a road to a company, we check if the city it connects has two or more roads belonging to the same company. If it does, we increase the number of cities with two or more roads belonging to one company.

We can continue this process until we have assigned all the roads. If the number of cities with two or more roads belonging to one company exceeds $k$, we can backtrack and try a different assignment.

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of cities. The space

  The problem is asking for the minimum and maximum number of occupied houses that can be achieved by a group of friends celebrating the New Year. The friends can move to the left or right of their current house, but they can only move once. The problem also states that the friends can come to houses with coordinates 0 and n+1 (if their houses are at 1 or n, respectively).

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum and maximum number of occupied houses that can be achieved by the friends. We can start by considering the number of occupied houses for each possible move.

If a friend moves to the left of their current house, the number of occupied houses decreases by 1. If a friend moves to the right of their current house, the number of occupied houses increases by 1. If a friend stays at their current house, the number of occupied houses remains the same.

We can use this information to find the minimum and maximum number of occupied houses that can be achieved by the friends. The minimum number of occupied houses is achieved when all friends move to the left of their current house, resulting in a decrease of 1 in the number of occupied houses. The maximum number of occupied houses is achieved

  This problem can be solved using a combination of backtracking and permutation generation. The basic idea is to generate all possible permutations of the kids and then check if each permutation satisfies the given information.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Generate all possible permutations of the kids using a backtracking algorithm.
2. For each permutation, check if the information given by the kids is consistent with the permutation.

  The problem is to find the maximum number of students in a balanced team, where a balanced team is defined as a team with no more than 5 difference in programming skills between any two students.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We can start by sorting the students by their programming skills in non-decreasing order. We can then take the first student and add them to the team. We can then consider the next student and compare their programming skill to the current team's average programming skill. If the difference between the two is less than or equal to 5, we can add them to the team. If the difference is greater than 5, we cannot add them to the team.

We can continue this process until we have added all $n$ students to the team. The maximum number of students in a balanced team is the number of students we have added to the team.

For example, suppose we have 6 students with programming skills [1, 10, 17, 12, 15, 2]. We can sort the students by their programming skills in non-decreasing order to get [1, 2, 1

  The problem is to find the number of substrings "abc" in a given string that can be formed by replacing all question marks with letters "a", "b", and "c".

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Replace all question marks with letters "a", "b", and "c" to obtain all possible strings.
2. Count the number of substrings "abc" in each string.
3. Sum up the number of substrings "abc" in all strings.

The number of substrings "abc" in a string can be calculated using a sliding window approach. We can use a sliding window of size 3 to scan the string and count the number of substrings "abc" in each window.

Here's an example of how to implement this approach:

1. Initialize a sliding window of size 3 with the first 3 characters of the string.
2. Scan the string from the 4th character to the last character.

  The problem is to find the minimum number of coins required to make a graph connected. The graph is given as an undirected graph with $n$ vertices, and each vertex has a number written on it, denoted by $a_i$. The cost of adding an edge between two vertices is the sum of the numbers written on them, denoted by $a_x + a_y$. There are also $m$ special offers, which can be used to add edges between vertices.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D array $dp$ of size $n \times n$, where $dp[i][j]$ represents the minimum number of coins required to make the graph connected from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$. We can initialize $dp[i][i] = 0$ for all $i$, since we don't need to pay any coins to connect a vertex to itself.

We can then fill in the rest of the array using the following recurrence relation:

$$dp[i][j] = \min\left(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][

* If $x = a$, then $f(x, y) = 0$ (since there is no fatigue at the end).
* If $x < a$ and $y = 0$, then $f(x, y) = -1$ (since there is no umbrella to protect Polycarp from the rain).
* If $x < a$ and $y > 0$, then $f(x, y) = \min\limits_{i = 1}^m \{f(x + 1, y - 1) + p_i\}$ (since Polycarp can pick up an umbrella at $x$ and move with it till $x + 1$ without an umbrella, throw it away and move on without an umbrella till $

  The problem is asking you to determine whether a triple of numbers is poor or not. A triple is poor if two of the numbers are equal but the other number is different from those two numbers.

To solve this problem, you need to check if the two numbers that are equal are the same, and if the third number is different from those two numbers. If the two numbers are the same and the third number is different, then the triple is poor.

Here's an example of how you can solve this problem:

1. Read the three integers A, B, and C from Standard Input.
2. Check if A and C are equal. If they are, then the triple is poor.
3. If A and C are not equal, then check if B is different from A and C. If B is different, then the triple is not poor.
4. If B is the same as A or C, then the triple is poor.

In the sample input given in the problem, the triple is poor because A and C are equal, but B is different from those two numbers. So, you would print "Yes" as the output.

  The problem is to find the number of ways to choose two of the N+M balls (disregarding order) so that the sum of the numbers written on them is even.

We know that the numbers written on N of the balls are even, and the numbers written on M of the balls are odd.

To find the number of ways to choose two of the N+M balls so that the sum of the numbers written on them is even, we can use the following approach:

1. Choose one of the N even numbers. There are N ways to do this.
2. Choose one of the M odd numbers. There are M ways to do this.
3. The sum of the two numbers is even, so we can choose either the even number and the odd number, or the odd number and the even number. There are 2 ways to do this.

Therefore, the number of ways to choose two of the N+M balls so that the sum of the numbers written on them is even is N \* M \* 2.

This count does not depend on the actual values written on the balls, so we can ignore the values and simply calculate the number of ways

Next, we need to sort the prices in ascending order. This is because we want to choose the cheapest fruits first.

Then, we need to calculate the minimum total price of fruits. We can do this by iterating through the sorted prices and adding the price of each fruit to a running total. We need to stop when we have chosen K kinds of fruits or when we have reached the total price of the last fruit.

Finally, we need to print the minimum total price of fruits.

The solution is to add the three integers and check if the sum is greater than or equal to 22. If the sum is greater than or equal to 22, print "bust"; otherwise, print "win".

The constraints are that the integers are between 1 and 13, and all values in the input are integers.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 2 and N.

We can start by finding the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 2. This is 2 itself.

Next, we need to find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by N. We can do this by dividing N by 2 and checking if the result is an integer. If it is, then we have found the smallest positive integer that is divisible by N.

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 2 and N. We can do this by multiplying the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 2 (which is 2) by the smallest positive integer that is divisible by N (which we just found).

In this case, the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 2 is 2, and the smallest positive integer that is divisible by N is 3. Therefore, the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 2 and N is 6.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 6.

The objective is to deploy an inspector under each of the N apple trees, and for each inspector, we want to inspect the trees with numbers between i-D and i+D (inclusive).

To achieve this objective, we need to deploy at least D+1 inspectors. This is because we need to inspect the trees with numbers between i-D and i+D (inclusive) for each inspector.

For example, if we have 6 apple trees and we want to inspect the trees with numbers between i-2 and i+2 (inclusive) for each inspector, we need to deploy at least 3 inspectors.

Therefore, the minimum number of inspectors that we need to deploy to achieve the objective is D+1.

Let's consider the first takoyaki. There are N-1 takoyaki left to choose from, and each of them has a different deliciousness value. So, the total health points restored from eating the first takoyaki is N-1 times the deliciousness value of the first takoyaki.

Now, let's consider the second takoyaki. There are N-2 takoyaki left to choose from, and each of them has a different deliciousness value. So, the total health points restored from eating the second takoyaki is N-2 times the deliciousness value of the second takoyaki.

* All values in input are integers.
* 3 ≤ A, B ≤ 20

To solve this problem, you need to find the maximum number of coins you can get by pressing the two buttons. The maximum number of coins you can get is the sum of the sizes of the two buttons. However, you can only press each button once, so you need to find the maximum number of coins you can

  The problem is to find the minimum time required to light K candles. The candles are placed on a number line, and Snuke can move left and right along the line with speed 1. He can also light a candle when he is at the same position as the candle, in negligible time.

The solution is to move Snuke to the position of the K-th candle and light it. Then, move Snuke to the position of the (K-1)-th candle and light it. Continue this process until all K candles are lit.

The time required to light K candles is the sum of the distances between Snuke's current position and the position of the K-th candle, plus the time required to light the K-th candle. The distance between Snuke's current position and the position of the K-th candle is equal to the absolute value of the difference between the two positions.

Therefore, the minimum time required to light K candles is the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the positions of the K-th candle and Snuke's current position, plus the time required

We also know that the depth of the snow cover is at least 1 meter, so we can write:

h1 - a + 1 = h2 - b + 1

Subtracting h1 - h2 from both sides gives:

If the monster's health is now 0 or below, Serval wins. Otherwise, the monster's health is now H - A, and we need to make another attack to decrease it further.

Now, let's consider the case where the monster's health is initially less than 0. In this case, Serval can make an attack and decrease the monster's health by A. If the monster's health is now 0 or below, Serval wins. Otherwise, the monster's health is now H - A, and we need to make another attack to decrease it further.

In either case, we need to make at least one attack to decrease the monster's health. Therefore, the number of attacks Serval needs to make before winning is at least 1.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the time interval during which both Alice and Bob were holding down their buttons.

We know that Alice started holding down her button 0 seconds after the start-up of the robot, and released her button 75 seconds after the start-up.

We also know that Bob started holding down his button 25 seconds after the start-up, and released his button 100 seconds after the start-up.

We can see that the time interval during which both Alice and Bob were holding down their buttons is between 25 seconds and 75 seconds.

Therefore, the answer is 50 seconds.

  The problem is asking for the number of odd numbers between 1 and N (inclusive) that have exactly eight positive divisors.

To solve this problem, we need to find all the odd numbers between 1 and N (inclusive) and then check if they have exactly eight positive divisors.

We can start by finding all the odd numbers between 1 and N (inclusive) using a simple loop. We can use the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is odd.

Next, we need to find the divisors of each odd number. We can use the division operator (/) to find the divisors. We need to check if the divisors are positive, so we can use the absolute value (abs()) function to get the absolute value of each divisor.

Finally, we need to count the number of odd numbers that have exactly eight positive divisors. We can use a counter variable to keep track of the number of odd numbers that have exactly eight positive divisors.

Here is the pseudocode for the solution:

1. Initialize a counter variable to 0.
2. Loop from 1 to N (inclusive) and check if

  To solve this problem, we need to distribute the N AtCoder Crackers to K users in such a way that the difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user is minimized.

One way to do this is to distribute the crackers in a way that each user receives an equal number of crackers. For example, if we have 7 crackers and 3 users, we can distribute them as follows:

User 1: 2 crackers
User 2: 2 crackers
User 3: 3 crackers

In this case, the largest number of crackers received by a user is 3, and the smallest number received by a user is 2, so the (absolute) difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user is 1.

Another way to distribute the crackers is to distribute them in a way that the difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user is minimized. For example, if we have 7 crackers and 3 users, we can distribute

  To solve this problem, we need to find the earliest ABC where Kurohashi can make his debut.

We know that Kurohashi has never participated in any ABC before, so we need to find the first ABC where all the digits of the contest number are the same.

Let's consider the first ABC to be held, which is ABC 100. The digits of the contest number in base ten are 1, 0, and 0. Since Kurohashi has never participated in any ABC before, he cannot make his debut in ABC 100.

The next ABC to be held is ABC 101, where the digits of the contest number in base ten are 1, 0, and 1. Again, Kurohashi cannot make his debut in ABC 101.

The next ABC to be held is ABC 110, where the digits of the contest number in base ten are 1, 1, and 0. Again, Kurohashi cannot make his debut in ABC 110.

The next ABC to be held is ABC 111, where the digits of the contest number in base

  The problem is to find the minimum total cost required to complete three tasks. The cost of completing each task is given by the absolute difference between the cost of the previous task and the current task.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a two-dimensional array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum total cost required to complete the first i tasks, where the j-th task is the last task to be completed.

We can initialize the first row of the array with the cost of completing the first task, which is 0.

For each row, we can calculate the minimum total cost required to complete the first i tasks by considering all possible combinations of the last task to be completed. We can calculate the cost of completing the j-th task at the end of the i-th task by considering the cost of completing the previous task and the cost of completing the j-th task.

We can use the following formula to calculate the cost:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + |A_j - A_k|) for all k from 1 to i-

  The problem is asking us to determine whether Takahashi will win or lose in a battle between his monster and Aoki's monster. The health and strength of Takahashi's monster are A and B, respectively, and those of Aoki's monster are C and D, respectively. The battle will take place in rounds, with each round consisting of Takahashi's monster attacking Aoki's monster, followed by Aoki's monster attacking Takahashi's monster. The battle will continue until one of the monsters has 0 or less health, at which point the other monster will win.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the monsters will attack each other. We can do this by considering the values of A, B, C, and D.

If A is greater than B, then Takahashi's monster will attack first. If A is less than or equal to B, then Aoki's monster will attack first.

If C is greater than D, then Aoki's monster will attack first. If C is less than or equal to D, then Tak

  The problem is to find the maximum value of X - Y, where X is the sum of the values of the gems obtained and Y is the sum of the costs paid.

The constraints are:

* N is the number of gems, which is between 1 and 20.
* Each gem has a value between 1 and 50.
* Each gem has a cost between 1 and 50.

The input is given in the following format:

* The first line contains the number of gems, N.
* The next N lines contain the values of the gems, V_1, V_2,..., V_N.
* The next N lines contain the costs of the gems, C_1, C_2,..., C_N.

The output is the maximum possible value of X - Y.

The solution is to find the maximum value of X - Y by choosing the gems with the highest values and paying the lowest costs. The maximum value of X - Y is achieved when all the gems are chosen, and the costs are the lowest possible.

  The problem is asking us to find the final state of a grid after Snuke has compressed it by removing rows and columns that consist only of white squares. The grid is represented as an H-by-W matrix, where each element is either a dot (.) or a pound sign (#).

To solve this problem, we need to follow the instructions given in the problem statement. We start by reading the input, which consists of two lines. The first line contains the number of rows (H) and columns (W) in the grid. The second line contains the elements of the grid, with each element separated by a space.

We then need to iterate through the grid and remove rows and columns that consist only of white squares. We can do this by iterating through the rows and columns, and checking if the current row or column consists only of white squares. If it does, we remove it and delete the space between the rows or columns.

After we have removed all the rows and columns that consist only of white squares, we print the final state of the grid. We do this by iterating through the remaining rows and columns, and printing each element of the grid.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the circumference of a circle with a given radius R. We can use the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.

Since the input is given in the format R, we can read the value of R from the input and use it to calculate the circumference. We can then print the calculated value of C.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the value of R from the input.
2. Calculate the circumference C = 2πr.
3. Print the calculated value of C.

Note that we need to use the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is C = 2πr. We can't simply print the value of R, as it's not the circumference of the circle.

  To solve this problem, we need to check if the string S consists of exactly two kinds of characters, and if both of those characters appear twice in S.

We can do this by using a hash table to keep track of the number of times each character appears in S. We can iterate through the characters in S and increment the count for each character we see. If we see a character that we haven't seen before, we know that it must be one of the two characters that we're looking for. If we see a character that we've seen before, we know that it must be the other character that we're looking for.

Once we've iterated through all of the characters in S, we can check if we've found both characters and if they both appear twice. If we have, we print "Yes"; otherwise, we print "No".

Here's an example of how this solution might look in code:

def check_string(s):
    # Create a hash table to keep track of the number of times each character appears

  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of stairways that Tanya climbed and the number of steps in each stairway.

First, we need to find the number of stairways that Tanya climbed. We can do this by counting the number of times the number $1$ appears in the sequence. Since $1$ appears in the sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, we can count the number of times $1$ appears in the sequence and subtract $1$ from the result. This will give us the number of stairways that Tanya climbed.

Next, we need to find the number of steps in each stairway. We can do this by counting the number of times each number appears in the sequence. For example, the number $1$ appears in the sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ $n$ times, so we can count the number of times $1$ appears in the sequence and divide the result by $n$. This will give us the number of steps in the first stairway.

We can repeat this process for each stairway to find the

  The problem is to find the values of $x$ and $k$ such that $x + 2x + 4x + \dots + 2^{k-1} x = n$.

To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of the first $k$ positive integers is equal to $k(k+1)/2$.

Let's consider the first test case of the example, where $n=3$. We need to find $x$ and $k$ such that $x + 2x + 4x + \dots + 2^{k-1} x = 3$.

We can start by noticing that $3 = 1 + 2 + 4$. Therefore, we can set $x=1$ and $k=3$. Then, we have:

$$1 + 2 + 4 = 1 + 2 + 4x + 2^{k-1} x$$

Since $k>1$, we can set $2^{k-1} x = 0$. Therefore, we have:

$$1 + 2 + 4 = 1 + 2 + 4

  To solve this problem, we need to apply the algorithm that Tanya uses to decrease a number by one. The algorithm is as follows:

1. If the last digit of the number is non-zero, she decreases the number by one.
2. If the last digit of the number is zero, she divides the number by 10 (i.e. removes the last digit).

We can use this algorithm to decrease the given number $n$ by $k$ times. We can do this by repeatedly applying the algorithm until we reach the result.

Here's an example of how we can apply the algorithm to decrease the number $512$ by $4$ times:

1. $512$ is divided by 10, giving us $51$.
2. $51$ is divided by 10, giving us $5$.
3. $5$ is divided by 10, giving us $0$.
4. $0$ is divided by 10, giving us $0$.

Therefore, the result of decreasing $512$ by $4$ times is $0$.

  The problem is to find the maximum number of people that can be arranged in a balanced circle, where the height difference between any two adjacent people is at most 1.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by choosing the person with the smallest height. We then choose the person with the next smallest height, but only if the height difference between the two people is at most 1. We continue this process until we have chosen all the people.

The key insight is that we can always find a balanced circle by starting with the person with the smallest height and then alternating between people with heights that are at most 1 apart. This is because if we have chosen a person with height $h_1$, then the next person we choose must have height at most $h_1 + 1$. If we have chosen a person with height $h_2$, then the next person we choose must have height at most $h_2 + 1$. And so on.

Therefore, the maximum number of people that can be arranged in a balanced circle is $n/2$, where $n$ is the total number of people. This is because we can always find

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of songs that Ivan needs to compress in order to fit all the songs on his flash drive.

We can start by sorting the songs by their initial size in descending order. Let's call the sorted list of songs "sorted_songs".

We can then iterate through the sorted_songs list and keep track of the sum of the sizes of the songs that we have already compressed. Let's call this sum "current_sum".

For each song in the sorted_songs list, we can check if the current sum plus the size of the current song is less than or equal to the capacity of the flash drive. If it is, we can add the current song to the list of compressed songs and update the current sum.

If the current sum plus the size of the current song is greater than the capacity of the flash drive, we can break out of the loop and print "-1" since it is not possible to compress a subset of the songs in such a way that all songs fit on the flash drive.

Once we have iterated through the entire sorted_songs list, we can print the minimum number of songs that

  To solve this problem, we need to construct a string of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters such that each substring of length $a$ has exactly $b$ distinct letters.

We can start by constructing a string of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. We can use the following approach:

1. Start with the first letter of the string.
2. For each subsequent letter, we can choose any letter that is not in the substring of length $a$ that ends at the current position.
3. Repeat step 2 until we have constructed the entire string.

For example, if $n = 7$ and $a = 5$, we can construct the string "tleelte" as follows:

1. Start with the first letter "t".
2. For the second letter, we can choose any letter that is not in the substring of length $a$ that ends at the current position, which is "tleel". We can choose "q".
3. For the third letter, we can choose any letter that is not in the substring of length $a$ that ends at the current position, which is "tleelq".

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of minutes it takes to make N pieces of takoyaki.

We know that Takahashi can make at most X pieces of takoyaki at a time, and it takes T minutes regardless of the number of pieces to make.

We can start by making X pieces of takoyaki in the first T minutes.

After that, we can make X pieces of takoyaki again in the next T minutes, and so on.

We can keep doing this until we have made N pieces of takoyaki.

The total number of minutes it takes to make N pieces of takoyaki is the sum of the number of minutes it takes to make each group of X pieces of takoyaki.

We can calculate the number of minutes it takes to make each group of X pieces of takoyaki by dividing the total number of minutes by the number of groups we need to make.

For example, if we need to make 20 pieces of takoyaki and we can make at most 12 pieces of takoyaki at a time, we need to make 2 groups of 12 pieces of takoyaki.

We can solve this problem by first sorting the students in non-decreasing order of their names.

Then, we can divide the students into groups of three or more students.

We can do this by starting with the first student and forming a group of three students.

Then, we can move on to the next student and form a group of three students.

We continue this process until we have formed all the groups.

The number of groups consisting of three or more students is the maximum number of groups we can form.

Therefore, the solution is to sort the students in non-decreasing order of their names and then divide them into groups of three or more students.

We can start by simmering two pieces of apple to make one apple pie. This leaves us with A - 2 apples and P - 2 pieces of apple.

Next, we can cut the remaining A - 2 apples into three pieces of apple. This gives us P + 1 pieces of apple.

Now, we can simmer P + 1 pieces of apple to make one more apple pie. This leaves us with P - 1 pieces of apple.

We can repeat this process by cutting the remaining A - 2 apples into three pieces of apple and simmering P - 1 pieces of apple to make another apple pie.

This process can continue until we have used all the apples and pieces of apple. The maximum number of apple pies we can make is 3.

Therefore, the output is 3.

To solve this problem, you need to check if A is a divisor of B. You can do this by dividing B by A and checking if the result is an integer. If it is, then A is a divisor of B.

Once you have determined whether A is a divisor of B, you can print the appropriate result. If A is a divisor of B, then print A + B. Otherwise, print B - A.

Here is an example of how you might solve this problem:

Let S be a string of length |S| = n. We want to check whether T, which is a string of length |T| = n + 1, can be obtained by appending one character at the end of S.

We can do this by checking whether the last character of S is the same as the first character of T. If they are the same, then we can append the last character of S to the end of T to get T.

For example, if S = "chokudai" and T = "chokudaiz", then we can append "z" to the end of "chokudai" to get "chokudaiz", which satisfies the property.

Therefore, if T satisfies the property, we print "Yes". Otherwise, we print "No".

  The problem is to find the integer K such that the absolute difference between A and K is equal to the absolute difference between B and K. If such an integer does not exist, print IMPOSSIBLE instead.

To solve this problem, we can start by considering the possible values of K. Since A and B are distinct integers between 0 and 10^9, we know that K cannot be equal to A or B. Therefore, K must be between A and B.

We can then consider the following cases:

* If A < B, then K must be greater than A and less than B. In this case, the absolute difference between A and K is equal to the absolute difference between B and K.
* If A > B, then K must be less than A and greater than B. In this case, the absolute difference between A and K is equal to the absolute difference between B and K.

Therefore, we can write a simple algorithm to solve this problem:

1. If A < B, then print K = (A + B) / 2.
2. If A > B, then print K = (A + B) / 2.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input from Standard Input.
2. Store the input in a variable called N.
3. Check if the remainder of N divided by 10 is 7. If it is, then print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".

Here's the code:

# Read the input from Standard Input
N = int(input())

# Check if N contains the digit 7
if N % 10 == 7:

Note that we used the modulo operator (%) to check if the remainder of N divided by 10 is 7. If the remainder is 7, then N contains the digit 7.

  To solve this problem, we need to determine if the sum of the digits in the decimal notation of N divides N.

We can start by converting N to a string and then iterating through each digit in the string. For each digit, we can add it to a running total. If the running total is equal to N, then we know that the sum of the digits in the decimal notation of N divides N.

Here's an example of how we can implement this solution in Python:

  To solve this problem, we need to find the missing vertices of the square.

We are given the coordinates of two vertices, (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2), but we have forgotten the coordinates of the other two vertices.

We can use the fact that the square has four vertices, and that the coordinates of the vertices are given in counter-clockwise order.

We can start by drawing a line connecting the two known vertices, (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2).

We can then draw a line perpendicular to this line, passing through the midpoint of the line connecting the two known vertices.

This line will intersect the square at two points, which are the missing vertices.

We can then find the coordinates of these points by solving the system of equations:

x_3 = (x_1 + x_2) / 2
y_3 = (y_1 + y_2) / 2

x_4 = (x_1 - x_2) / 2

Let's consider the case where S = U. In this case, we have one ball with the string S and B balls with the string T.

Let's consider the case where T = U. In this case, we have A balls with the string S and one ball with the string T.

So, the answer is the sum of the number of balls with the string S and the number of balls with the string T, which is A + B.

  The problem is to determine whether a given string is a concatenation of two copies of some string. We can solve this problem by finding a string T such that S = T + T.

We can start by considering the length of the string S. Since S is a concatenation of two copies of some string, we know that the length of S is even. Therefore, we can divide the length of S by 2 to get the length of T.

Next, we can consider the characters of the string S. Since S is a concatenation of two copies of some string, we know that the characters of S are the same as the characters of T. Therefore, we can take the first half of the characters of S and the second half of the characters of S to get the string T.

For example, if S = "abcabc", we can take the first half of the characters of S, which is "abc", and the second half of the characters of S, which is "abc", to get the string T.

Therefore, we can conclude that if S is a concatenation of two copies of some string, we can find a string T such that S = T + T.

  The problem is to find the maximum possible area of the part of a rectangle that is not larger than the other part, given a point on the border or inside the rectangle.

To solve this problem, we can start by drawing a line through the point (x, y) that is parallel to the x-axis. This line will cut the rectangle into two parts, one on the left of the line and one on the right.

The area of the part on the left is the area of the triangle formed by the line, the x-axis, and the bottom edge of the rectangle. The area of the part on the right is the area of the triangle formed by the line, the x-axis, and the top edge of the rectangle.

The maximum possible area of the part on the left is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the triangle formed by the line, the x-axis, and the bottom edge of the rectangle.

  The problem is asking you to determine the number of colors of the arare in the bag based on the colors of the arare that have been taken out of the bag. The colors are represented as P, W, G, and Y.

The first line of input is the number of arare in the bag, N. The second line of input is the colors of the arare in the bag, separated by spaces.

The problem states that there are three colors in the bag: pink, white, and green, or four colors: pink, white, green, and yellow.

The colors of the arare are represented as P, W, G, and Y.

The problem also states that there always exist i, j, and k such that S_i=P, S_j=W, and S_k=G.

The task is to print Three if the number of colors of the arare in the bag was three, or Four if the number of colors was four.

The sample input is 6 and G W Y P Y W, which means that the bag contains 6 arare, and the colors of the arare are G, W, Y,

  This is a classic game theory problem, known as the "Doors" problem. The goal is to maximize the number of doors with durability equal to $0$ at the end of the game, while Slavik tries to minimize the number of such doors.

To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal strategy for both players. The optimal strategy is the strategy that maximizes the expected value of the game, assuming both players play optimally.

Let's first consider the first phase of the game, where you make your move. The optimal strategy is to break one of the doors with the highest current durability. This is because breaking a door with high durability reduces the number of doors with durability equal to $0$, which is the variable we want to maximize.

Now, let's consider the second phase of the game, where Slavik makes his move. The optimal strategy for Slavik is to repair one of the doors with the lowest current durability. This is because repairing a door with low durability increases the number of doors with durability equal to $0$, which is the variable we want to minimize.

Now, let's consider the end

  The problem is asking us to find the number of pairs of topics that are considered "good" by the teacher and the students. A good pair of topics is defined as a pair of topics $i$ and $j$ ($i < j$) such that the interestingness of topic $i$ for the teacher is greater than the interestingness of topic $j$ for the teacher, and the interestingness of topic $i$ for the students is greater than the interestingness of topic $j$ for the students.

To solve this problem, we can first sort the topics by their interestingness for the teacher and the students. We can then iterate through the sorted topics and count the number of good pairs of topics.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Sort the topics by their interestingness for the teacher and the students.
2. Initialize a counter to 0.
3. Iterate through the sorted topics:

  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of connected components that are also cycles. We can do this by performing a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph.

1. Initialize a set $S$ to be the set of all vertices in the graph.
2. While $S$ is not empty, perform a DFS on the graph starting from an arbitrary vertex $u \in S$.
3. If the DFS reaches a vertex $v$ that is not in $S$, add $v$ to $S$ and mark it as visited.
4. If the DFS reaches a vertex $v$ that is already marked as visited, then $v$ is a cycle.
5. After the DFS is complete, the number of cycles is the number of vertices in $S$.

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(m + n)$, where $m$ is the number of edges and $n$ is the number of vertices. The space complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices.

The algorithm works as follows:

  The problem is to find the number of nice edges in an undirected tree with at least one red vertex and at least one blue vertex. A nice edge is an edge that doesn't split the tree into two components that both contain vertices of both red and blue colors.

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the tree and mark each edge as nice or not nice based on the colors of the vertices it connects. We can use a boolean variable to keep track of whether we have seen a red vertex or a blue vertex in the current component. If we have seen both, we can mark the edge as nice. If we have seen neither, we can mark the edge as not nice.

Here is a step-by-step description of the algorithm:

1. Initialize a boolean variable $red$ to false and a boolean variable $blue$ to false.
2. Initialize a counter $nice$ to 0.
3. For each edge $e$ in the tree:

  The problem is to find the median of a list of strings of length $k$ that are lexicographically not less than $s$ and not greater than $t$. The list is guaranteed to have an odd number of elements.

To solve this problem, we can first find the list of strings that are lexicographically not less than $s$ and not greater than $t$. We can do this by generating all possible strings of length $k$ using the alphabet of lowercase Latin letters. We can then filter out the strings that are not lexicographically between $s$ and $t$.

Once we have the filtered list, we can find the median by taking the middle element of the list. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the element that is closer to the middle.

For example, if $s=$"az" and $t=$"bf", the list of strings that are lexicographically not less than $s$ and not greater than $t$ is ["az", "ba", "bb", "bc", "bd", "be", "bf"]. The median

  This problem can be solved using a backtracking algorithm. The basic idea is to try all possible combinations of students and check if the ratings of the team are distinct. If a suitable team is found, print "YES" and the indices of the students in the team. If no suitable team is found, print "NO".

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Initialize a boolean array "used" of size n, where used[i] = false indicates that the i-th student has not been used in the team yet.
2. Initialize a variable "count" to 0, which will keep track of the number of students in the team.
3. While count < k:
	* Choose a student whose rating is not equal to the rating of any of the students in the team. If no such student is found, return "NO".
	* Add the chosen student to the team and increment count.
	* Mark the chosen student as used in the "used" array.

  The problem is to find two integer sequences, one strictly increasing and the other strictly decreasing, such that the elements of the increasing sequence are inserted between the elements of the decreasing sequence without changing the order. The input is a sequence of integers, and the output is a sequence of 0s and 1s indicating whether each element of the input sequence belongs to the increasing or decreasing sequence.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by considering the first element of the input sequence. If it is less than or equal to the last element of the input sequence, then we can insert it into the increasing sequence. Otherwise, we can insert it into the decreasing sequence.

Next, we can consider the second element of the input sequence. If it is less than or equal to the last element of the input sequence, then we can insert it into the increasing sequence. Otherwise, we can insert it into the decreasing sequence.

We can continue this process until we have considered all the elements of the input sequence. If we have inserted all the elements into the increasing sequence, then we can print "YES" and the resulting sequence. If we have inserted all the elements into the decreasing sequence,

  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of lanterns that Vova will see during the path. We can do this by analyzing the path and the standing train.

First, let's consider the path. The path starts at the point $1$ and ends at the point $L$. The speed of the train is $1$ length unit per minute, so the train moves $1$ unit per minute.

Next, let's consider the lanterns. The lanterns are placed at the points with coordinates divisible by $v$, where $v$ is the period of the lantern appearance. In this case, the lanterns are placed at the points $v$, $2v$, $3v$, $4v$, and so on.

Now, let's consider the standing train. The standing train occupies all the points from $l$ to $r$ inclusive. In this case, the standing train occupies all the points from $51$ to $51$ inclusive, which means that it covers the entire path.

So, to find the number of lanterns that Vova will see during the path, we need to

  The problem is to find the number of ways to divide $n$ people into two round dances, where each round dance consists of exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ people. The round dances are indistinguishable if one can be transformed to another by choosing the first participant.

Let's consider the case where $n$ is even. We can divide the $n$ people into two round dances as follows:

1. Divide the first $\frac{n}{2}$ people into two groups of size $\frac{n}{4}$.
2. Divide the second $\frac{n}{2}$ people into two groups of size $\frac{n}{4}$.

For example, if $n=8$, we can divide the people into two round dances as follows:

Round dance 1: [1, 3, 5, 7]
Round dance 2: [2, 4, 6, 8]

These two round dances are indistinguishable, as we can transform one into the other by swapping the first and second people in each round dance.

  The solution to this problem is to use a stack to keep track of the letters that have been removed. The stack will contain the letters that have been removed in reverse order.

Here's how the algorithm works:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. For each letter in the input string, check if it is one of the letters that Polycarp wants to remove. If it is, push it onto the stack.
3. If the stack is not empty, pop the top letter from the stack and remove it from the input string.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty or the input string is empty.
5. If the stack is empty, print the resulting string. If the input string is empty, print nothing.

Here's an example of how this algorithm would work for the input "cccaabababaccbc" and k = 3:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. The input string is "cccaabababaccbc". The first letter is "c". Since "c" is not one of the letters that Polycarp wants to remove, push it onto the stack.

  This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum day when Ivan can order all microtransactions of type i and actually start playing, assuming he has already ordered j microtransactions of type i.

The base case is when j = 0, in which case Ivan can start playing immediately.

For the recursive case, we consider two possible scenarios:

1. Ivan orders a microtransaction of type i on the current day. In this case, he can start playing on the next day (day + 1).
2. Ivan does not order a microtransaction of type i on the current day. In this case, he can start playing on the same day as the minimum day when he can order all microtransactions of type i.

We can calculate the minimum day when Ivan can order all microtransactions of type i by considering both scenarios and taking the minimum of the two.

The final answer is the minimum day when Ivan can order all microtransactions he wants and actually start playing, which is the minimum of all dp[i][j] for all i and j.

The size of a star is the length of its rays. The number of stars in the output can't exceed $n \cdot m$. Each star should be completely inside the grid.

To solve this problem, we need to find a way to draw the grid using stars of different sizes. We can start by drawing a star in the center of the grid, and then draw stars around it with different sizes. We can use the same size for multiple stars if they are not intersecting or overlapping.

Here's an example of how we can draw the grid using stars of different sizes:

1. Draw a star in the center of the grid with size $1$.
2. Draw a star on the left side of the grid with size $2$.

  To solve this problem, you need to check if the number is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward in decimal notation.

To check if a number is a palindrome, you can convert it to a string and then check if the string is the same as the reversed string.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

1. Read the input number N from the standard input.
2. Convert N to a string.
3. Reverse the string.

  To solve this problem, we need to compare the numbers written on Alice's and Bob's cards. If Alice's card has a number that is stronger than Bob's card, then Alice will win the game. If the numbers are equal, then the game will be drawn.

We can use a simple if-else statement to determine the outcome of the game. If Alice's card has a number that is stronger than Bob's card, then we print "Alice" as the outcome. If the numbers are equal, then we print "Draw". Otherwise, we print "Bob" as the outcome.

Here's the code:

# Read the numbers from the input

# Compare the numbers
if a > b:

elif a == b:

else:

3. Find the nearest checkpoint: For each student, find the checkpoint with the smallest Manhattan distance.
4. Print the output: Print the index of the nearest checkpoint for each student.

Here's an example of how this would work for the sample input:

a^3 = a^2 \* a

Now, we can calculate the final result by adding a + a^2 + a^3.

a + a^2 + a^3 = a + a^2 + a^3

Finally, we print the result as an integer.

2. Given two strings of characters, find the longest common substring between them.
3. Given two strings of characters, find the shortest distance between them.

We can use these sub-problems to solve the original problem.

Step 1: Find the first occurrence of the template image B in the image A.

We can use the first sub-problem to find the first occurrence of the template image B in the image A. We can start by finding the first occurrence of the first row of the template image B in the image A. If we find a match, we can move on to the next row of the template image B and repeat the process.

Now, we need to find the maximum possible value of the formula X + Y. We can do this by considering all possible combinations of X and Y.

To solve this problem, we need to find the highest price item and the remaining N-1 items, and then calculate the total amount that Mr. Takaha will pay.

Next, we need to find the remaining N-1 items. We can do this by finding the second highest price item and the third highest price item, and so on.

Once we have found the highest price item and the remaining N-1 items, we can calculate the total amount that Mr. Takaha will pay. We can do this by multiplying the highest price item by 0.5 (since he gets a discount for buying it), and then adding the total price of the remaining

* ARC Curry: 50 minutes
* AGC Pasta: 57 minutes

Next, we can find the multiplicative inverse of this sum by multiplying it by the denominator:

\frac{1}{\frac{1}{A_1} + \frac{1}{A_2} +... + \frac{1}{A_N}} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 +... + A_N}{1 + A_1 + A_2 +... + A_N}

Finally, we can simplify this expression by canceling out the common factor of A_1 + A_2 +... + A_N:

To solve this problem, we need to find the K trees that are closest to each other in height. We can do this by sorting the heights of the trees in non-decreasing order and then selecting the first K trees.

For example, if we have 5 trees with heights 10, 15, 11, 14, and 12, and we want to decorate 3 trees, we would sort the heights in non-decreasing order to get 10, 11, 12, 14, 15. Then we would select the first 3 trees, which would be the tallest and shortest trees, and the difference between their heights would be 2.

Therefore, the minimum possible value of h_{max} - h_{min} is 2.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple if-else statement to check if the input is uppercase or lowercase. If the input is uppercase, we print "A". If the input is lowercase, we print "a".

Here's an example of how we can solve this problem:

To solve this problem, we can use a brute force approach. We can iterate over all possible values of X, Y, and Z, and check if the sum of the three values is equal to S.

We can start by defining a function that takes three integers X, Y, and Z as input and returns true if the sum of the three values is equal to S, and false otherwise. We can then use a nested loop to iterate over all possible values of X, Y, and Z, and check if the sum of the three values is equal to S.

Here is an example of how we can implement this function in Python:

def is_valid_triple(x, y, z):

We can then use a nested loop to iterate over all possible values of X, Y, and Z, and check if the sum of the three values

  The problem is to determine the format of a given digit sequence, which is either YYMM or MMYY. The sequence is given as a string of length 4.

To solve this problem, we can first check if the sequence is valid in the YYMM format. We can do this by checking if the last two digits of the sequence are a valid year and the two digits before them are a valid month. If the sequence is valid in this format, we print YYMM.

If the sequence is not valid in the YYMM format, we can check if it is valid in the MMYY format. We can do this by checking if the two digits before the last two digits of the sequence are a valid month and the last two digits are a valid year. If the sequence is valid in this format, we print MMYY.

If the sequence is valid in both YYMM and MMYY formats, we print AMBIGUOUS. If the sequence is not valid in either format, we print NA.

Let's consider the case where K = 3. We can choose the even number from {2, 4} and the odd number from {1, 3}. Therefore, there are 2 ways to choose a pair of an even number and an odd number from the positive integers between 1 and 3 (inclusive).

Now, let's consider the case where K = 5. We can choose the even number from {2, 4, 6} and the odd number from {1, 3, 5}. Therefore, there are 3 ways to choose a pair of an even number and an odd number from the positive integers between 1 and 5 (inclusive).

In general, the number of ways to choose a pair of an even number and an odd number from the positive integers between 1 and K (inclusive) is

For example, if the current time is 9 o'clock, and the contest will begin in 12 hours, the time when the contest will begin will be 21 o'clock.

So, the solution is to add the number of hours to the current time to find the time when the contest will begin.

The Displayed Rating is calculated based on the number of contests he has participated in. If he has participated in 10 or more contests, his Displayed Rating is equal to his Inner Rating. Otherwise, his Displayed Rating is his Inner Rating minus 100 times the number of contests he has participated in.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of contests Takahashi has participated in. We can do this by subtracting his Displayed Rating from his Inner Rating. If the result is positive, then Takahashi has participated in 10 or more contests. If the result is negative, then he has participated in less than 10 contests.

Once we know the number of contests Takahashi has participated in, we can calculate his Inner Rating. If he has participated in 10 or more contests, his Inner Rating is equal to his Displayed Rating. Otherwise, his Inner Rating is his Displayed Rating minus 100 times the

First, we need to convert N to base-K. We can do this by dividing N by K and taking the remainder. We repeat this process until N is 0.

For example, if N = 11 and K = 2, we would start by dividing 11 by 2, which gives us 5 with a remainder of 1. We would then divide 5 by 2, which gives us 2 with a remainder of 1. We would then divide 2 by 2, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 1. Finally, we would divide 1 by 2, which gives us 0 with a remainder of 1.

So, the base-2 representation of 11 is 1011. There are 4 digits in this representation.

Therefore, the number of digits in the base-K representation of N is 4.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of sheets of paper that Takahashi needs to print the document.

We know that two pages of data can be printed on one sheet of paper, so we need to divide the total number of pages by two.

Since N is an integer, we can round down the result to get the minimum number of sheets of paper needed.

So, the solution is to round down the result of dividing N by two.

  The problem is asking whether E869120 and square1001 can take the desired number of pieces of cake without violating the rule that "the same person should not take two adjacent pieces of cake".

The rule states that the same person should not take two adjacent pieces of cake. This means that if E869120 wants to take A pieces of cake, then square1001 should not take B pieces of cake, where A and B are the numbers of pieces of cake that E869120 and square1001 want to take, respectively.

The problem also states that A and B are integers between 1 and 16 (inclusive). This means that E869120 and square1001 can take any number of pieces of cake between 1 and 16, inclusive.

The problem also states that A+B is at most 16. This means that E869120 and square1001 can take a total of at most 16 pieces of cake.

To solve the problem, we need to determine whether E

  The problem is to find the minimum difference between the number X formed by taking three consecutive digits from a given string S and the number 753. The constraints are that S is a string of length between 4 and 10, and each character in S is 1, 2,..., or 9.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum difference between X and 753. We can do this by finding the minimum difference between X and 753 for each possible position of the three consecutive digits in S.

Let's consider the first digit of S as 1, the second digit as 2, and the third digit as 3. We can form the number X by concatenating these three digits. For example, if S = "123456789", then X = 123.

Now, we need to find the minimum difference between X and 753. We can do this by finding the minimum difference between X and 753 for each possible position of the three consecutive digits in S.

Let's consider the first digit of S as 1, the second digit as 2, and

  The problem is to find the minimum number of people who could have broken into the basement and the number of swords each of them has taken, given the number of types of swords, the number of swords of each type that remained in the basement after the theft, and the number of swords each person has taken.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of people who could have broken into the basement and the number of swords each of them has taken, given that we have already broken into the basement and taken j swords of the i-th type.

We can initialize the table as follows:

* dp[i][0] = 1 for all i, since each person must take at least one sword of each type.
* dp[i][j] = 0 for all i and j such that a[i] < j, since it is not possible to take more swords of a particular type than the number of swords of that type that remained in the basement.

We can then fill in the remaining

  The problem is to find the maximum number of days that Polycarp can train if he chooses the contests optimally.

Let's consider the $k$-th day. On this day, Polycarp should solve exactly $k$ problems. He can choose one of the contests that he didn't solve yet and solve exactly $k$ problems from it. If there are no contests that Polycarp didn't solve yet and have at least $k$ problems, then Polycarp stops his training.

Let's denote the number of contests that Polycarp didn't solve yet and have at least $k$ problems as $c_k$. We want to find the maximum value of $c_k$.

If $k = 1$, then Polycarp can solve exactly one problem from any contest, so $c_1 = n$.

If $k > 1$, then we can find the maximum value of $c_k$ by considering the following cases:

* Polycarp chooses a contest that he didn't solve yet and has at least $k$ problems. In this case, $c_k = c_{k-

  The problem is to find the minimum diameter of a tree that can be formed by adding edges to a given forest. The given forest is an undirected graph with $n$ vertices such that each connected component is a tree. The diameter of a connected undirected graph is the maximum number of edges in the shortest path between any pair of its vertices.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum diameter of a tree that can be formed by adding edges to the given forest. We can do this by finding the minimum diameter of each tree in the forest and then adding the edges that connect the trees to form a single tree with the minimum diameter.

To find the minimum diameter of each tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. We start at a vertex in the tree and then explore all the vertices that are reachable from it. We keep track of the minimum diameter of each tree as we explore it. When we reach a vertex that is not in any tree, we add it to the tree that has the minimum diameter.

Once we have found the minimum diameter of each tree, we can add the edges that connect the trees to form a single tree with the minimum diameter. We can

  The problem is to find the subset of vertices with the maximum total weight such that there is no pair of vertices with the distance $k$ or less between them in this subset.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by selecting the vertex with the maximum weight and adding it to the subset. We then consider the remaining vertices and add them to the subset if they are not connected to any vertex in the subset with a distance of $k$ or less.

We repeat this process until we have selected all the vertices. We then calculate the total weight of the subset and return it as the answer.

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the tree. This is because we need to consider all the vertices in the tree and check if they are connected to any vertex in the subset with a distance of $k$ or less.

The space complexity of this algorithm is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the tree. This is because we need to store the subset of vertices in memory.

The algorithm works as follows:

  The problem is asking us to find the dormitory and room number for each letter, given the room number among all rooms of all dormitories. We can solve this problem by creating a mapping between the room number and the dormitory and room number.

We can do this by first creating a list of all the room numbers in the order they appear in the sequence of letters. We can then create a dictionary where the key is the room number and the value is a tuple containing the dormitory number and the room number in that dormitory.

For example, if we have 3 dormitories with 10, 15, and 12 rooms respectively, the list of room numbers would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26].

  The problem is to find three positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that the four numbers written on a board are the pairwise sums of $a$, $b$, and $c$ and the sum of all three numbers.

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. Write down the four numbers on a board in the order $a+b$, $a+c$, $b+c$, and $a+b+c$.
2. Observe that the sum of the first three numbers is equal to the sum of the last three numbers.
3. Therefore, we can find the missing number $a+b+c$ by subtracting the sum of the first three numbers from the sum of the last three numbers.
4. Now, we have two equations:

$a+b+c = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4$

$a+b+c = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 - (x_1 + x_2 + x_3)$

Solving these equations, we get:

  The problem is to find the minimum number of recolors needed to make a garland diverse. A garland is diverse if any two adjacent lamps have distinct colors.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by recoloring the garland one lamp at a time. At each step, we can choose the next lamp to recolor based on the following criteria:

1. If the current lamp is not colored, we can recolor it to any color.
2. If the current lamp is colored, we can recolor it to a different color than its current color.

We can keep track of the number of recolors needed to make the garland diverse. We can also keep track of the diverse garland that we have constructed so far.

At each step, we can check if the garland is diverse. If it is, we can stop. If it is not, we can continue recoloring the garland until it is diverse.

The time complexity of this approach is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of lamps in the garland. The space complexity is $O(1)$, since we only need to keep track of

  The problem is to find the longest subsequence of a given array of integers that forms an increasing sequence of consecutive integers. The subsequence can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array. The problem is to find the longest such subsequence.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array dp of size n x n, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum length of the subsequence of the first i elements that ends at the jth element. We can initialize dp[i][i] = 1 for all i, as the subsequence of length 1 ending at the ith element is valid.

We can then fill in the rest of the dp array using the following recurrence relation:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][k] + 1) for all k from i to j - 1 such that a[k] < a[j]

This recurrence relation states that the maximum length of the subsequence ending at the jth element is the maximum of the lengths of all subsequences ending at the kth element, where k is

  To solve this problem, we need to find an integer C between 1 and 3 such that A \* B \* C is an odd number.

We know that A, B, and C are all between 1 and 3, inclusive. Therefore, we can start by checking all possible values of C: 1, 2, and 3.

If we check C = 1, we get A \* B \* C = 3 \* 1 \* 1 = 3, which is an odd number.

If we check C = 2, we get A \* B \* C = 3 \* 1 \* 2 = 6, which is an even number.

If we check C = 3, we get A \* B \* C = 3 \* 1 \* 3 = 9, which is an odd number.

Therefore, we can conclude that there is an integer C between 1 and 3 that satisfies the condition, and we can print "Yes".

Now, we need to find the cost of traveling from Station A to Station C using the special ticket. The special ticket allows Joisino to take the bus for half the fare if she travels from Station A to Station B by train and then travels from Station B to Station C by bus.

To find the cost of traveling from Station A to Station C using the special ticket, we need to find the cost of traveling from Station A to Station B by train and then traveling from Station B to Station C by bus.

The cost of traveling from Station A to Station B by train is X yen.

The cost of traveling from Station B to Station C by bus is Y yen.

Next, we consider the second digit. Since it must be a digit between 1 and N (inclusive), we have a total of N possible choices for the second digit.

Finally, we consider the third digit. Since it must be a digit between 1 and N (inclusive), we have a total of N possible choices for the third digit.

Therefore, the total number of possible passwords is N x N x N = N^3.

So, the answer is 8.

If Takahashi is 9 years old, his age is not a multiple of 3, 5, or 7, so his growth will not be celebrated in Shichi-Go-San.

For example, if the label of the 1000-th round is ABC, then the label of the 999-th round is ABD.

Therefore, the first three characters of the label of the N-th round is determined by the following formula:

To solve this problem, we need to check if there exists a pair of antennas that have a distance greater than k between them. We can do this by checking the distances between each pair of antennas. If there is a pair of antennas that have a distance greater than k between them, then we know that they cannot communicate directly.

We can start by checking the distances between the first two antennas, A and B. If the distance between them is greater than k, then we know that they cannot communicate directly. We can then move on to the next pair of antennas, C and D, and check the distance between them. If the distance between them is greater than k, then we know that they cannot communicate directly. We can continue this process until we have checked all possible pairs of antennas.

If we find a pair of antennas that have a distance greater than k between them, then we know that there exists a pair of antennas that

  To solve this problem, we need to find the next contest rated for Takahashi based on his rating.

We know that the next contest after ABC is ARC, which is rated for contestants with ratings less than 2800.

We also know that the next contest after ARC is AGC, which is rated for all contestants.

So, if Takahashi's rating is less than 1200, the next contest rated for him is ABC.

If Takahashi's rating is less than 2800, the next contest rated for him is ARC.

If Takahashi's rating is greater than or equal to 2800, the next contest rated for him is AGC.

Therefore, we can write a program that checks Takahashi's rating and prints the name of the next contest rated for him based on his rating.

  To solve this problem, we need to replace each digit 1 with 9 and each digit 9 with 1 in the given integer n.

First, we need to find the position of each digit 1 and 9 in the integer. We can do this by using the modulo operator (%) to get the remainder of dividing the integer by 10.

For example, if n = 119, we can find the position of the digit 1 by doing:

n % 10 = 1

This tells us that the digit 1 is in the ones place.

We can also find the position of the digit 9 by doing:

n / 10 = 11

This tells us that the digit 9 is in the tens place.

Now, we need to replace each digit 1 with 9 and each digit 9 with 1 in the integer. We can do this by using the modulo operator (%) to get the remainder of dividing the integer by 10, and then using the division operator (/) to get the quotient of dividing the integer by 10.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input string $b$ from the input.
2. Find all the substrings of length $2$ in the string $b$. For example, if the input string is "bccddaaf", the substrings are "bc", "cc", "dd", "da", "af".
3. Sort the substrings in lexicographic order. For example, the sorted substrings are "af", "bc", "cc", "dd", "da".
4. Concatenate the sorted substrings to form the original string $a$. For example, if the sorted substrings are "af", "bc", "cc", "dd", "da", the original string $a$ is "abccddaaf".

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves required to make $a$ divisible by $b$. We can do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $a$ and $b$.

The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. In other words, it is the largest number that divides both $a$ and $b$ without leaving a remainder.

To find the GCD of $a$ and $b$, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm is a way of finding the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0.

For example, to find the GCD of $10$ and $12$, we can start by subtracting $12$ from $10$ to get $2$. Then we subtract $2$ from $10$ to get $8$. Then we subtract $8$ from $12$ to get $4$. Finally, we subtract $4$ from $12$ to get $8$, which means that $10$ and $12$ have a

  The problem is asking you to compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days. The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days.

To solve this problem, you need to first calculate the average temperature for each segment of $k$ consecutive days. You can do this by taking the average of the temperatures for each segment. For example, if the temperatures are $3, 4, 1, 2$, and $k = 3$, the average temperatures for each segment of $k = 3$ consecutive days are $3, 4, 2.5, 2.666666666666667$.

Next, you need to find the maximum of these average temperatures. In this case, the maximum average temperature is $2.666666666666667$.

So, the heat intensity value is $2.666666666666667$.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by sorting the array in non-decreasing order. Then, we iterate through the array and for each position $i$, we check if it is possible to swap the element at position $i$ with the element at position $i+1$. If it is possible, we swap the elements and continue to the next position. If it is not possible, we stop and print "NO".

  The problem is to find the original string that was encrypted using Polycarp's repeating cipher. The encryption process involves writing each letter of the original string a certain number of times, where the number is equal to the position of the letter in the original string. For example, if the original string is "bab", the encryption process would be: "b" $\to$ "baa" $\to$ "baabbb".

To decrypt the encrypted string $t$, we need to find the original string $s$ such that the encryption process of $s$ gives $t$. We can do this by trying all possible strings of length $n$, where $n$ is the length of the encrypted string $t$. For each string $s$, we can calculate the encryption of $s$ using Polycarp's algorithm, and compare it with $t$. If the encryption of $s$ is equal to $t$, then we have found the original string $s$.

Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:

  The problem is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the weight of some edges in the graph by $1$ such that the cost of the minimum spanning tree remains the same.

To solve this problem, we can use a technique called "shortest augmenting path". The idea is to find a path in the graph that connects two vertices with different weights, and then increase the weight of the edges along this path by $1$. This will result in a new minimum spanning tree with the same cost as the original tree, but with unique edges.

To find the shortest augmenting path, we can use a modified version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. The modified algorithm starts at a source vertex and repeatedly finds the shortest path from the source to all other vertices in the graph. The path is augmented by increasing the weight of the edges along the path by $1$. The algorithm stops when there are no more edges to augment.

The time complexity of the modified Bellman-Ford algorithm is $O(m + n\log n)$, where $m$ is the number of edges and $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. This is because the algorithm needs to visit

We can prove that this algorithm is correct by showing that it always produces a nice garland. Suppose we have colored the first $i$ lamps in the garland with colors $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_i$. We want to color the $i+1$th lamp. If it is the same color as the $i$th lamp, we can color it the same color. Otherwise, we can color it the opposite color.

Suppose we have colored the first $i$ lamps with colors $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_i$ and we want to color the $i+1$th

  To solve this problem, we need to convert the bitcoins into yen at the rate of 380000.0 JPY per 1.0 BTC. We can do this by multiplying the number of bitcoins by the conversion rate.

For example, if we have 0.10000000 bitcoins, we can convert it to yen by multiplying it by 380000.0, which gives us 38000.0 yen.

We can then add up the total value of all the gifts in yen. In this case, the total value is 10000 + 38000.0 = 48000.0 yen.

Therefore, the total value of all the gifts is 48000.0 yen.

Let's say the train has N cars, and we want to find the value of j such that the i-th car from the front is the j-th car from the back.

We can start by finding the position of the i-th car from the front. Since the first car is at position 1, the i-th car from the front would be at position i.

Next, we need to find the position of the j-th car from the back. Since the last car is at position N, the j-th car from the back would be at position N - j + 1.

Now, we need to find the difference between the position of the i-th car from the front and the position of the j-th car from the back. This difference is the value of j we are looking for.

We can start by checking if there is a pair of stations that are operated by Company A and Company B. If there is, we can connect them with a bus service.

If there is no pair of stations that are operated by Company A and Company B, we can check if there is a pair of stations that are operated by Company A and Company B. If there is, we can connect them with a bus service.

To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the number of consecutive rainy days. We can do this by using a variable to keep track of the number of consecutive rainy days, and by using a flag to indicate whether the current day is rainy or not.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

  To solve this problem, we need to follow the given operations in the order given.

1. Swap the contents of the boxes A and B.
2. Swap the contents of the boxes A and C.

After the first operation, the boxes A and B will contain the integers that were originally in boxes A and B, respectively. So, after the first operation, the boxes A and B will contain 2 and 3, respectively.

After the second operation, the boxes A and C will contain the integers that were originally in boxes A and C, respectively. So, after the second operation, the boxes A and C will contain 3 and 1, respectively.

Therefore, the final contents of the boxes A, B, and C will be 3, 1, and 2, respectively.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of the Ferris wheel for Takahashi based on his age.

First, we need to determine the age group that Takahashi belongs to. We can do this by dividing his age by 5. If the result is 0 or greater than 10, then Takahashi is 10 years old or older. If the result is between 1 and 5, then Takahashi is between 6 and 10 years old. If the result is between 6 and 10, then Takahashi is between 6 and 12 years old. If the result is 11 or greater than 12, then Takahashi is 13 years old or older.

Next, we need to determine the cost of the Ferris wheel based on the age group that Takahashi belongs to. If Takahashi is 10 years old or older, then the cost is 100 yen. If Takahashi is between 6 and 12 years old, then the cost is half the cost of the Ferris wheel, which is 50 yen. If Takahashi is

  The problem is asking you to find the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols. The symbols are given to you as a string S. The first character in S is the first symbol for him to eat, and so on.

To solve this problem, you need to keep track of the integer in Takahashi's mind as he eats the symbols. When he eats a +, the integer increases by 1. When he eats a -, the integer decreases by 1.

The first step is to initialize the integer in Takahashi's mind to 0. Then, you need to loop through each character in S and check if it is a + or -. If it is a +, you increase the integer by 1. If it is a -, you decrease the integer by 1.

After looping through all the characters in S, the integer in Takahashi's mind will be the final result. Therefore, you need to print the integer at the end.

Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:

  To solve this problem, we need to check if the date represented by the input string S is not later than April 30, 2019. We can do this by comparing the date represented by S with the date April 30, 2019.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input string S from Standard Input.
2. Split the input string S into three parts: the year, the month, and the day.
3. Convert the month and day parts of the input string to integers.
4. Create a new date object using the year, month, and day parts.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of problems that can be hosted in a set of thematic contests.

We can start by sorting the problems by their topics. We can then group the problems by their topics and find the maximum number of problems in each group.

We can then take the maximum number of problems in each group and multiply it by 2 to get the number of problems in each contest. We can then add up the number of problems in each contest to get the total number of problems in all the contests.

The key is to make sure that each contest has a topic that is different from the previous contest. We can do this by taking the topics in order and grouping them in pairs. We can then take the maximum number of problems in each pair and multiply it by 2 to get the number of problems in each contest.

For example, if we have the topics 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, we can group them in pairs as follows:

1, 2

  The problem is asking you to find the list of conversations (in the order they are displayed on the screen) after processing all n messages. The only difference between the easy and hard versions is the constraint on n and k.

The solution is to maintain a list of conversations, where each conversation is represented by a list of friend IDs. The list of conversations is initially empty.

For each message, if the conversation with the friend ID is already displayed on the screen, do nothing. Otherwise, if the number of displayed conversations is less than k, add the conversation to the list. If the number of displayed conversations is equal to k, remove the last conversation from the list and add the new conversation to the beginning of the list.

After processing all n messages, the list of conversations will contain the conversations in the order they are displayed on the screen.

The output is the list of conversations, where each conversation is represented by a list of friend IDs. The list of conversations is guaranteed to be less than or equal to k.

  The problem is asking for the minimum number of coins that Polycarp needs to use to get a certain value using a subset of his coins. The values of the coins are guaranteed to be integer powers of 2, so we can use a binary search to find the minimum number of coins needed to get a value.

The idea is to start with the largest coin and try to get the value using that coin. If the value is not possible, then we know that we need to use at least 2 coins to get the value. We can then try to get the value using the next largest coin, and so on.

We can use a binary search to find the minimum number of coins needed to get the value. We start by assuming that we need 1 coin to get the value, and then we try to get the value using 2 coins, 3 coins, and so on. If we can't get the value using a certain number of coins, then we know that we need to use at least that number of coins to get the value.

We can use a loop to iterate through the values of the coins and try to get the value using each coin.

  This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum total joy levels of the players among all possible card distributions where the first i cards are distributed and the j-th player has already received his k cards.

The base case is dp[0][j] = 0, since no cards have been distributed yet and the j-th player has not received any cards.

The recurrence relation is dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1] + h[c[i]]), where c[i] is the number on the i-th card and h[c[i]] is the joy level of the j-th player if he gets exactly c[i] cards with his favorite number written on them.

The answer is dp[k \cdot n][n], where k \cdot n is the total number of cards and n is the number of players.

The time complexity of this solution is O(k \cdot n \cdot n), and the space complexity is O(k

  The problem is to find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal. The operations are either adding or subtracting the absolute difference between two adjacent elements.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start with the first element of the array and try to make it equal to all other elements. We do this by adding or subtracting the absolute difference between the first element and the other elements. We continue this process until all elements are equal.

The key insight is that we can always make the first element equal to all other elements by adding or subtracting the absolute difference between the first element and the other elements. This is because the absolute difference between two adjacent elements is always non-negative, so we can always add or subtract it without changing the sign of the elements.

For example, consider the array [2, 4, 6, 6, 6]. We can make all elements equal by adding or subtracting the absolute difference between the first element and the other elements. In this case, we can add 2 to the first element to make it equal to the other elements.

The algorithm works as follows:

  In this problem, we are given a binary string $s$ that describes the current state of a restaurant. The string contains "0" and "1", where "1" represents an occupied table and "0" represents a free table. The restaurant has $n$ tables arranged along a straight line, and the state of the restaurant is described by a string of length $n$.

The problem is to find the maximum number of free tables that we can occupy so as not to violate the rules of the restaurant. The rules of the restaurant prohibit people from sitting at a distance of $k$ or less from each other. That is, if a person sits at the table number $i$, then all tables with numbers from $i-k$ to $i+k$ (except for the $i$-th) should be free.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can define a function $f(i, j)$ that represents the maximum number of free tables that we can occupy so as not to violate the rules of the restaurant, where $i$ is the current table number and $j$ is the number of free tables that we have already occupied.

  This problem can be solved using a technique called "segment intersection" or "segment overlap". The basic idea is to find all the pairs of segments that overlap, and then remove the segments that overlap.

To find the pairs of segments that overlap, we can use a simple algorithm that checks each segment against every other segment. If two segments overlap, we remove the segment that ends earlier. If two segments have the same endpoints, we remove the segment that appears earlier in the input.

Once we have found all the pairs of segments that overlap, we can remove the segments that overlap. We can do this by keeping track of the segments that we have already removed, and only removing a segment if it has not been removed yet.

The key insight is that we can use a data structure called a "disjoint set" to keep track of which segments overlap. A disjoint set is a data structure that allows us to efficiently find the connected components of a graph. In this case, we can use a disjoint set to find the connected components of the graph of segments, where two segments are connected if they overlap.

By using a disjoint set, we can efficiently find the pairs of segments that overlap, and then remove the segments

  In this problem, we are given a pool of $n$ problems, and we have to choose at most three problems to form a contest. The prettiness of each problem is given as $a_i$. The task is to find the maximum possible cumulative prettiness of the contest composed of at most three problems.

The problem statement also mentions that the prettinesses of chosen problems cannot divide each other. This means that if we choose three problems, the prettinesses of the first two problems should not be divisible by the third problem, and the prettinesses of the first and third problems should not be divisible by the second problem, and the prettinesses of the second and third problems should not be divisible by the first problem.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by choosing the problem with the highest prettiness, and then we can choose the next two problems in such a way that the prettinesses of the first two problems are not divisible by the third problem. We can continue this process until we have chosen at most three problems.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of teams that can be formed such that no two students with a difference of 1 in their programming skills are in the same team.

We can start by sorting the programming skills in increasing order, which will give us the following sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 20, 100.

Now, we can start forming teams. We can start with the first student, who has a programming skill of 1. We can form a team with this student and the next student, who has a programming skill of 2. We can continue this process until we reach the last student, who has a programming skill of 100.

However, we need to make sure that no two students with a difference of 1 in their programming skills are in the same team. This means that we need to make sure that the difference between the programming skills of any two students in the same team is strictly greater than 1.

For example, if we form a team with students 1 and 2, and then form a team with students 3 and 4, we

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by considering the cases where $x = 0$ or $y = 0$. If $x = 0$, then we can take any number of coins of value $1$ and the total value will be $S$. If $y = 0$, then we can take any number of coins of value $n$ and the total value will be $S$.

Now, let's consider the case where $x > 0$ and $y > 0$. In this case, we can take $x$ coins of value $n$ and $y$ coins of value $1$. The total value of taken coins will be $S$ if and only if $xn + y = S$.

  The problem is to find two sequences of integers, one strictly increasing and the other strictly decreasing, that can be formed from a given shuffled sequence. The input consists of a sequence of integers, and the output consists of two sequences of integers, one strictly increasing and the other strictly decreasing.

The solution is to first find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS) of the given sequence. The LIS and LDS are the longest sequences of integers in the given sequence such that all elements in the sequence are either in the LIS or the LDS.

Once the LIS and LDS are found, we can form the two sequences of integers by concatenating the elements of the LIS and LDS. The first sequence will be the LIS, and the second sequence will be the LDS.

For example, if the given sequence is [7, 2, 7, 3, 3, 1, 4], the LIS is [7, 2, 7, 3, 3], and the LDS is [1, 4]. The two sequences of integers that can be formed from the given sequence are

The easy version of the problem is to find a set of books such that Alice and Bob like at least $k$ books from the set. This can be done by finding the $k$ books that Alice and Bob like and reading them together. The total reading time of these books is the sum of the time required to read each book.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of $B$ such that for all products, the condition $|a_i - B| \le k$ is satisfied.

We can start by considering the case where all products have the same price $a$. In this case, the maximum value of $B$ is $a + k$, since the difference between the old price and the new price is at most $k$.

Now, let's consider the case where the prices of the products are not all the same. We can sort the prices in non-decreasing order, and let $a_1$ be the smallest price and $a_n$ be the largest price.

We can start by considering the case where $a_1 = a_n$. In this case, the maximum value of $B$ is $a_1 + k$, since the difference between the old price and the new price is at most $k$.

Now, let's consider the case where $a_1 \neq a_n$. We can divide the products into two groups: the products with price $a_1$ and the products with price $a_n$. We can solve

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it good.

A good array is one that can be split into six equal-sized subsequences of the required numbers: $4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42$.

To check if an array is good, we can count the number of elements in each subsequence and see if they are all present. If the number of elements in each subsequence is not equal, then the array is not good.

To find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed, we can start by removing any elements that are not required. We can remove any element that is not one of $4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42$.

Once we have removed any unnecessary elements, we can check if the remaining elements form a good array. If they do, then we can stop. If they do not, then we can remove any additional elements that are not required.

We can continue this process until we have removed all the unnecessary elements and the remaining array is good. The minimum number of

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain the value $b$ from the initial value $a$. We can do this by keeping track of the current value of $a$ and the number of moves made so far.

We can start by initializing $a$ to the initial value $a$ and $moves$ to 0. We then loop through each move, where we choose an integer $k$ from $1$ to $10$ and either add $k$ to $a$ or subtract $k$ from $a$. We update $moves$ accordingly.

We continue this loop until we reach the value $b$. Once we reach $b$, we return the number of moves made so far.

The time complexity of this solution is $O(10^5 \cdot 10^9)$, which is optimal since we need to consider all possible values of $k$ for each move. The space complexity is $O(1)$, since we only need to keep track of the current value of $a$ and the number of moves made so far.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum integer $k$ such that $0 \leq k \leq n$ and $k \bmod x = y$. We can do this by using the modulo operation, which gives us the remainder of dividing $k$ by $x$.

We know that $0 \leq k \leq n$, so we can start by finding the maximum integer $k$ such that $0 \leq k \leq n$ and $k \bmod x = y$. We can do this by using the modulo operation, which gives us the remainder of dividing $k$ by $x$.

For example, if $x = 7$ and $y = 5$, we can find the maximum integer $k$ such that $0 \leq k \leq n$ and $k \bmod x = y$ by finding the maximum integer $k$ such that $0 \leq k \leq n$ and $k \bmod 7 = 5$.

1. Find the number of pairs of boxes that can be formed by selecting two boxes from the $n$ boxes.

  The problem is asking you to take a string S of length N consisting of A, B, and C, and lowercase the K-th character in it. The K-th character is the character that appears at index K-1 in the string.

To solve this problem, you can use a for loop to iterate through the characters of the string S, and a variable to keep track of the index of the current character. When the index is equal to K-1, you can replace the current character with its lowercase version.

Here is an example of how you might solve this problem:
```
string s = "ABC";
int k = 1;

for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
    if (i == k - 1) {
        s[i] = tolower(s[i]);
    }
}

cout << s << endl;

This code will output "aBC".

Note that the `tolower()` function is used to convert the character to its lowercase version.

  To solve this problem, we need to first sort the restaurants by their city names in lexicographical order. We can do this by creating a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the city name and the restaurant's score. We can then sort this list by the city names in lexicographical order.

Once the list is sorted, we can then sort the restaurants within each city by their scores in descending order. We can do this by creating a new list of tuples, where each tuple contains the city name and the restaurant's score. We can then sort this list by the scores in descending order.

Finally, we can print the identification numbers of the restaurants in the order they are introduced in the book. We can do this by iterating through the sorted list of tuples and printing the identification number of each restaurant.

Here is the code in Python:

# Read the input

  The problem is asking us to determine if the sum of 500-yen coins is greater than or equal to a certain amount, X. We are given the number of coins, K, and the amount, X.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by adding up the values of the coins and storing the result in a variable, say, sum. We can then compare the value of sum to X. If sum is greater than or equal to X, we print "Yes" as the answer. Otherwise, we print "No" as the answer.

Here's the pseudocode for the solution:

1. Read the values of K and X from the input.
2. Initialize the sum variable to 0.
3. Loop K times:

4. If the sum variable is greater than or equal to X, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".

Note that this solution assumes that the coins are of the same denomination (500 yen in this case). If the coins are of different denominations, we would need to adjust the algorithm

Now, let's consider the case where the die shows 2. In this case, Snuke needs to get three consecutive heads from three coin flips to obtain a score of 10 or above. The probability of this happening is (1/3) x (1/2)^3 = 1/24.

First, we need to determine the current day of the week. We can do this by checking the first letter of the input string, which will be either "S" for Sunday, "M" for Monday, "T" for Tuesday, and so on.

Once we know the current day of the week, we can count the number of days until the next Sunday. We can do this by subtracting the current day of the week from 7 (the number of days in a week). If the result is positive, it means that the next Sunday is in the future, and we can print the result. If the result is negative, it means that the next Sunday has already passed, and we can print 0.

Here is an example of how this solution would work:

We can start by finding the values of x_i for i = 2001 to 2009. We can do this by using the formula repeatedly. For example, to find x_2001, we can use the formula as follows:

x_2001 = rx_{2000} - D = 2 \times 20 - 10 = 30

To find x_2002, we can use the formula as follows:

x_2002 = rx_2001 - D = 2 \times 30 - 10 = 50

Similarly, we can find the values of x_i for i = 2003 to 2010 as follows:

We can initialize $dp[0][0][0] = 0$, since there is no way to split the array into three parts such that $sum_1 = sum_3$ and $sum_1$ is the maximum possible value.

For each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, we can calculate $dp[i][j][k]$ for each $j$ and $k$ from $0$ to $n-i$. We can calculate $dp[i][j][k]$ as follows:

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. If $x = y = z$, then we can set $a = b = c = x$.
2. If $x \neq y \neq z$, then we can set $a = x$, $b = y$, and $c = z$.

  The problem is to find the maximum number of objects that can be packed into boxes of size $k$ using the algorithm described in the problem statement. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Start with all the boxes empty.
2. Go from left to right through the objects and try to pack each object into the current box. If the object fits in the box, remove it from the list of objects and decrease the size of the box by the size of the object.
3. If there are no more empty boxes and there is at least one object not in any box, then the algorithm cannot pack the chosen set of objects.
4. If there are no more objects to pack, then the algorithm has packed all the objects.

The key insight is that the algorithm will always pack the objects in the order in which they are given, and it will always pack the objects in the boxes in the order in which they are given. Therefore, the maximum number of objects that can be packed is the number of objects that can be packed in the first box, which is $k$.

Therefore, the maximum number of objects that can be packed is $k$.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of substrings that can be formed using only the letters that are available on the broken keyboard. We can do this by counting the number of substrings that can be formed using each letter in the broken keyboard.

Let's consider the string "abacaba" and the broken keyboard that has only the letters "a" and "b" available. We can form the following substrings using only these letters:

* "a"
* "ab"
* "aca"
* "acab"
* "acaba"

There are 5 substrings that can be formed using only the letters "a" and "b" available on the broken keyboard.

Now, let's consider the string "sadfaasdda" and the broken keyboard that has only the letters "f", "a", and "d" available. We can form the following substrings

  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum by size (length) alternating subsequence of the given sequence $a$. We can do this by first finding all possible alternating subsequences of length $k$ for some $k \in [1, n]$, where $n$ is the length of the input sequence $a$. We can then find the maximum sum of elements of each of these subsequence by summing up the elements of each subsequence. Finally, we can choose the subsequence with the maximum sum as the answer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Find all possible alternating subsequence of length $k$ for some $k \in [1, n]$.
2. For each subsequence, find the sum of its elements.
3. Choose the subsequence with the maximum sum as the answer.

To find all possible alternating subsequence of length $k$, we can use the following approach:

1. Start with the first element of the input sequence $a$.
2. If the current element is positive, add it to the subsequence and move to the next element.

  The problem is to find a spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph with maximum degree over all vertices. The maximum degree is the number of edges incident to a vertex. The graph is given as a list of edges, and the task is to find a spanning tree such that the maximum degree over all vertices is maximum possible.

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The basic idea is to start from an arbitrary vertex and explore the graph depth-first, adding edges to the spanning tree as we go. We keep track of the maximum degree over all vertices as we go, and we stop when we have found a spanning tree with the maximum degree.

Here is a step-by-step description of the algorithm:

1. Start with an arbitrary vertex $v_0$ and create an empty spanning tree $T$.
2. Explore the graph depth-first starting from $v_0$. For each vertex $v$ that we visit, add all of its edges to $T$ if they are not already in $T$.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves needed to get all the figures into one cell. We can do this by analyzing the board and finding the shortest path to move all the figures to one cell.

Let's consider a board of size $n \times n$, where $n$ is odd. We can divide the board into four quadrants: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right. Each quadrant has a size of $n/2 \times n/2$.

We can start by moving all the figures in the top-left quadrant to the bottom-right quadrant. We can do this by moving one figure at a time from the top-left quadrant to the bottom-right quadrant, and then moving the figure from the bottom-right quadrant to the top-right quadrant. We can repeat this process until all the figures in the top-left quadrant are moved to the bottom-right quadrant.

Next, we can move all the figures in the top-right quadrant to the bottom-left quadrant. We can do this by moving one figure at a time from the top-right quadrant

  The problem is to find the minimum number of moves required to reach any position $j$ such that $a_j$ has the opposite parity from $a_i$.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D array $dp$ where $dp[i][j]$ represents the minimum number of moves required to reach position $j$ from position $i$.

We can initialize the first row of the array with the values $1, 1, 1, 2, -1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1$. This is because the minimum number of moves required to reach position $j$ from position $i$ is 1 if $j = i + 1, i + 2, i + 3, i + 4, i + 5, i + 6, i + 7, i + 8, i + 9, i + 10$.

We can then fill in the remaining rows of the array using the following recurrence relation:

$$dp[i][j] = \min\left(dp[i - 1][j - a

  To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct integers $a, b, c$ such that $2 \le a, b, c$ and $a \cdot b \cdot c = n$.

We can start by finding the prime factors of $n$. Let's say $n = p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ are prime numbers and $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$ are positive integers.

We can then set $a = p_1^{a_1 - 1}$, $b = p_2^{a_2 - 1}$, and $c = p_3^{a_3 - 1}$, where $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ are the prime factors of $n$.

Note that $a, b, c$ are distinct because they are the prime factors of $n$. Also, $2 \le a, b, c$ because $p_1, p_2

  The problem is to find the minimum number of operations needed to modify a string so that every prefix of even length has an equal number of 'a' and 'b' letters.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can define a function $f(i, j)$ that represents the minimum number of operations needed to modify the first $i$ letters of the string so that every prefix of even length has an equal number of 'a' and 'b' letters.

We can define the function recursively as follows:

* If $i = 0$, then $f(0, j) = 0$ because there is no need to modify any letters.
* If $j = 0$, then $f(i, 0) = 1$ because we need to replace the last letter of the string with the other letter.
* If $i > 0$ and $j > 0$, then $f(i, j) = \min(f(i - 1, j), f(i - 1, j - 1)) + 1$. This means that we need to replace the last letter of the string with the other letter

  The problem is to find the shortest path that visits all the key points on a Cartesian plane. The key points are guaranteed to be distinct and the point $(0, 0)$ is not in the set. The path should visit all the key points in a way described above, meaning that the first level points are such points that $max(x_i, y_i) = 1$, the second level points are such points that $max(x_i, y_i) = 2$ and so on. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by visiting the key points in the order of their levels, starting from the minimum level. We then visit the points of the next level only if we have visited all the points of the previous level. We continue this process until we have visited all the key points.

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of key points. The space complexity

  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible volume of a rectangular cuboid whose sum of the dimensions is L.

We can start by considering the volume of a rectangular cuboid with dimensions 1, 1, and 1, which is 1.

Now, we need to find the maximum possible volume of a rectangular cuboid whose sum of the dimensions is L.

We can do this by finding the maximum possible volume of a rectangular cuboid with dimensions x, y, and z, where x + y + z = L.

We can do this by finding the maximum possible value of x, y, and z, subject to the constraint that x + y + z = L.

We can do this by solving the following system of equations:

x + y + z = L
x, y, and z are non-negative integers

We can solve this system of equations by using the method of complete the squares.

We can write the system of equations as:

x + y + z = L
(x + y) + z = L
(x + y)^2 + 2z = L^2

  To solve this problem, we need to write a program that receives input from the user and prints the appropriate output based on the input.

First, we need to read the input from the user. We can do this by using the `scanf()` function in C. The `scanf()` function takes a format string as an argument, which specifies the format of the input. In this case, we want to read an integer, so we can use the `%d` format specifier.

Next, we need to check the input to see if it is 1 or 2. If it is 1, we should print "Hello World". If it is 2, we should read two more integers, A and B, and then print A+B.

Here is the code for the program:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    scanf("%d", &n);

    if (n == 1) {

  The problem is asking us to compare two strings of digits, where the first string is the concatenation of b copies of the digit a, and the second string is the concatenation of a copies of the digit b. We need to determine which of these strings is lexicographically smaller.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can compare the two strings character by character, starting from the leftmost character. If the characters are the same, we move on to the next character. If one string is shorter than the other, we know that the shorter string is lexicographically smaller.

For example, let's consider the two strings 444 and 3333. We can compare these strings character by character as follows:

444
3333

Since the first character of the first string is 4, and the first character of the second string is 3, we know that the first string is lexicographically smaller. Therefore, we print 3333 as the answer.

In summary, we can solve this problem by comparing the two strings character by character, starting from the leftmost character. If one string is shorter than

  The problem is to find the letter that comes after the letter C in the alphabet. Since C is not z, we know that C is a lowercase English letter. We need to find the next letter in the alphabet that comes after C.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by defining the alphabet as a list of lowercase English letters. We can then use a for loop to iterate through the alphabet, starting from the letter after C. Once we find the next letter, we can print it and exit the loop.

Here is an example of how this algorithm might work:

1. Define the alphabet as a list of lowercase English letters: alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l','m', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r','s', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']

  The problem is asking you to concatenate two strings, T and S, without any spaces in between. The input consists of two strings, S and T, separated by a space. The output is the resulting string after concatenating T and S.

To solve this problem, you need to read the input from the standard input, which consists of two strings separated by a space. Then, you need to concatenate the two strings without any spaces in between. Finally, you need to print the resulting string.

Here's an example of how you can solve this problem:
```
# Read the input from the standard input
S, T = input().split()

# Concatenate the two strings without any spaces in between
result = T + S

# Print the resulting string
print(result)
```
In this example, we first read the input from the standard input using the `input()` function. We then split the input string into two parts using the `split()` function, which separates the input string into two substrings based on the space character. We then concatenate the two substrings without any spaces in between using the `+` operator. Finally, we print the resulting string using the

  The problem is to find the minimum possible sum of non-deleted elements of the array after the game ends. The game ends when Polycarp cannot make a move.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible sum of non-deleted elements of the array after the game ends. We can do this by considering the parity of the elements in the array.

Let's consider the parity of the elements in the array. If the parity of the elements is alternating (i.e., even-odd-even-odd-...), then the sum of non-deleted elements is zero. If the parity of the elements is not alternating, then the sum of non-deleted elements is non-zero.

To find the minimum possible sum of non-deleted elements of the array after the game ends, we need to find the minimum possible sum of non-deleted elements of the array after the game ends, assuming that the parity of the elements is alternating.

Let's consider the case where the parity of the elements is alternating. In this case, the sum of non-deleted elements is zero. We can prove this by considering

We can fill in the table as follows:

* $dp[0][j][k] = 0$ for all $j$ and $k$, since you don't have to fight any monsters if you don't have any.
* $dp[i][j][k] = dp[i-1][j-a][k]$ for all $i$, $j$, and $k$, since you don't have to fight the $i$th monster if you don't have to fight any monsters.
* $dp[i][j][k] = dp[i-1][j][k-1]$ for all $i$, $j$, and $k$, since you can use the secret technique to skip your turn and let your opponent fight the $i$th monster.

  This problem can be solved using a technique called "modular arithmetic."

The idea is to consider the array as a circular array, where the last element is connected to the first element. For example, if the array is [3, 2, 0, 6, 10, 12], we can consider it as [3, 2, 0, 6, 10, 12, 3].

Now, let's define a function $f(i)$ that returns the remainder of the element at position $i$ when divided by $m$. For example, if the array is [3, 2, 0, 6, 10, 12], then $f(1) = 2$, $f(2) = 0$, $f(3) = 6 \% 2 = 0$, $f(4) = 10 \% 2 = 0$, $f(5) = 12 \% 2 = 0$, and $f(6) = 3 \% 2 = 1$.

  This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum day when Ivan can order all microtransactions of type i and actually start playing, given that he has already ordered j microtransactions of type i.

The base case is when j = 0, in which case Ivan can start playing immediately.

For the recursive case, we consider two possible scenarios:

1. Ivan orders a microtransaction of type i on the current day. In this case, he can start playing on the next day, which is the current day + 1.
2. Ivan does not order a microtransaction of type i on the current day. In this case, he can start playing on the day when he orders the next microtransaction of type i.

We can calculate the minimum day when Ivan can start playing for each type of microtransaction and each number of microtransactions ordered, and store the result in the dp array.

The final answer is the minimum day when Ivan can start playing, which is the minimum of the dp[i][j] values for all types of microtransactions and all numbers of micro

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. Sort the sticks in non-decreasing order of their lengths.
2. Create a rectangle using the first stick and the second stick.
3. If the area of the rectangle is equal to the desired area, then we are done. Otherwise, we need to add another stick to the rectangle.

6. If the area of the rectangle is still less than the desired area, then we cannot create $n$ rectangles of equal area using the given sticks.

We can use a greedy algorithm to solve this problem. We can start by sorting the sticks in non-decreasing order of their lengths. We can then create a rectangle using the first

  To solve this problem, we need to find the $k$-th smallest shortest path in the graph. We can do this by first computing the matrix of shortest paths, which is a matrix $d$ where $d_{i, j}$ is the length of the shortest path between vertices $i$ and $j$. We can then find the $k$-th smallest element in the sorted array consisting of all $d_{i, j}$, which is the $k$-th smallest shortest path in the graph.

To compute the matrix of shortest paths, we can use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. The algorithm works by maintaining a matrix $d$ where $d_{i, j}$ is the length of the shortest path between vertices $i$ and $j$. We initialize $d$ with the weights of the edges, and then we update $d$ in each iteration by finding the minimum of the following three values:

* The weight of the edge between vertices $i$ and $k$ plus

  This problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization, known as the "Team Diversity" problem. The goal is to divide a set of students into teams such that the diversity of each team is minimized.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. The basic idea is to start by selecting the student with the highest programming skill and form a team with them. Then, we select the next student with the highest programming skill and add them to the team. We continue this process until we have formed all $n$ teams.

To calculate the diversity of each team, we need to calculate the maximum and minimum programming skills of the students in the team. We can do this by keeping track of the maximum and minimum programming skills of the students in each team.

Once we have formed all $n$ teams, we can calculate the total diversity of the division of students by summing the diversity of each team.

The key insight here is that the diversity of a team is a measure of how diverse the team is. A team with a high diversity is more diverse than a team with a low diversity. Therefore, we want to minimize the diversity of each team while still

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of round numbers that add up to a given positive integer $n$. We can do this by breaking down the number into its digits and then finding the minimum number of round numbers that add up to each digit.

For example, if we are given the number $n = 5009$, we can break it down into its digits as follows:

5009 = 500 + 9

Now, we need to find the minimum number of round numbers that add up to each digit. For the digit 5, we can use the number 500, which is a round number. For the digit 9, we can use the number 9, which is also a round number. Therefore, the minimum number of round numbers that add up to $n$ is 2, and the answer is 500 + 9 = 509.

In general, we can use the following algorithm to solve the problem:

  The problem is asking us to find the day on which each kid will receive their book back for the first time. The only difference between the easy and hard versions is the constraint that the sequence $p$ is a permutation.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can keep track of the day on which each kid receives their book back for the first time. We can do this by creating an array of size $n$, where $n$ is the number of kids. We can initialize all the elements of the array to -1, which means that no kid has received their book back for the first time yet.

Then, we can iterate through each day and each kid. For each kid, we can check if the book they are currently holding is the same as the book that the kid is supposed to receive on the current day. If it is, then we know that the kid has received their book back for the first time on this day. We can update the array to reflect this.

After we have iterated through all the kids and all the days, we can print the final array, which will contain the day on which each kid received their book back for the first time.

  In this problem, we are given $n$ goods, and we need to find the minimum possible equal price of all $n$ goods so that if we sell them for this price, we will receive at least the same (or greater) amount of money as if we sell them for their initial prices.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple optimization algorithm. We can start by setting the price of the first good to be $a_1$. Then, we can set the price of the second good to be $a_2$, and so on.

At each step, we need to make sure that the total amount of money we will receive if we sell all $n$ goods for the current price is not less than the total amount of money we will receive if we sell them for their initial prices. This means that we need to make sure that the sum of the current prices is not less than the sum of the initial prices.

We can use a simple formula to calculate the total amount of money we will receive if we sell all $n$ goods for the current price:

Total amount = (n-1) \* a_1 + (n-2) \* a_2 +...

  This problem can be solved using a combination of data structures and algorithms.

First, we can create a data structure to represent the relationships between programmers. We can use a graph data structure, where each node represents a programmer and each edge represents a mentorship relationship. We can also use a hash table to keep track of the number of programmers that each programmer can mentor.

Next, we can process the input and update the graph and the hash table accordingly. For each pair of programmers that are in a quarrel, we can remove the edge between them from the graph and update the hash table to reflect that the second programmer can no longer be mentored by the first programmer.

Finally, we can iterate over the graph and update the hash table to reflect the number of programmers that each programmer can mentor. We can then print the hash table as the output.

The time complexity of this solution is $O(n + k)$, where $n$ is the number of programmers and $k$ is the number of pairs of programmers that are in a quarrel. The space complexity is $O(n + k)$, where $n$ is the number of programmers and $k$ is

The solution to this problem is to use a technique called "backtracking". The basic idea of backtracking is to start with an empty string and recursively add characters to it until we have a string of length $n$ that meets the requirements.

Here's a high-level description of the algorithm:

1. Start with an empty string.
2. For each character in the string, check if it is already in the string. If it is, move on to the next character.
3. If the character is not in the string, add it to the string and recursively call the function with the updated string.
4. If the string is of length $n$, check if it has at least $k$ distinct characters. If it does, return the string.
5. If the string is not of length $n$ or does not have at least $k$ distinct characters, backtrack and remove the last character from

  The problem is to find the minimum number of shots required to knock down all $n$ cans exactly once, where the durability of each can is given by $a_i$. The solution is to shoot the cans in the following order:

1. Shoot the can with the highest durability first.
2. Shoot the can with the second highest durability.
3. Shoot the can with the third highest durability.
4. Repeat step 1 until all cans are knocked down.

This solution works because the durability of each can is at least 1, so the total number of shots required to knock down all cans is at least the sum of the durabilities of all cans. By shooting the cans in the order described above, we can ensure that each can is knocked down exactly once, and the total number of shots required is minimized.

For any integer j (1 ≤ j ≤ i), P_i ≤ P_j.

At each step, we check if the current value at index i is less than or equal to the maximum value for any index j less than or equal to i. If it is, we increment a counter to keep track of the number of integers that satisfy the condition.

Once we have iterated through the entire permutation, we print the counter as the final answer.

  The problem is to find the minimum number of elements that needs to be removed from a sequence so that it becomes a good sequence. A good sequence is defined as a sequence where each element occurs exactly the number of times it appears in the sequence.

To solve this problem, we can use a hash table to keep track of the number of occurrences of each element in the sequence. We can then iterate through the sequence and remove any elements that do not have the correct number of occurrences.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Python:

  The problem is asking us to find out which variable Snuke assigned 0 to. We are given the values of the five variables after the assignment by Snuke. We need to find the variable that was assigned 0.

To solve this problem, we can start by looking at the values of the variables. If the value of x_i is 0, then we know that Snuke assigned 0 to x_i. We can check each variable in turn to see which one has a value of 0.

We can start by checking x_1, since it was initially assigned the value of 1. If x_1 has a value of 0, then we know that Snuke assigned 0 to x_1. We can print the value of i, which is 1, to indicate that Snuke assigned 0 to x_1.

If x_1 does not have a value of 0, then we can move on to the next variable, x_2. We can repeat this process until we find the variable that has a value of 0.

In the sample input given, x_1 has a value of 0, so we know that S

In this division, the largest piece has an area of 5 blocks (the three blocks on the right side), and the smallest piece has an area of 5 blocks (the three blocks on the left side).

The difference between the areas of the largest and smallest pieces is 5 - 5 = 0.

Now, let's consider another division of the bar:

[ ] [ ] [ ]

In this division, the largest piece has an area of 6 blocks (the three blocks on the right side), and the smallest piece has an area of 4 blocks (the three blocks on the left side).

  The problem is to determine whether it is possible to rearrange the elements of a sequence so that the product of each pair of consecutive elements is a multiple of 4.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by considering the first element of the sequence, and then consider the second element. If the product of the first two elements is not a multiple of 4, we can swap them. We can continue this process until we reach the end of the sequence.

For example, consider the sequence (1, 10, 100). We can start by considering the first two elements, which have a product of 10. Since 10 is not a multiple of 4, we can swap them, so the sequence becomes (10, 1, 100).

Next, we consider the third element, which has a product of 100 with the second element. Since 100 is a multiple of 4, we can keep the third element in its current position.

Finally, we consider the fourth element, which has a product of 100 with the third element. Since 100 is a multiple

  To solve this problem, we need to determine whether it is possible to rearrange the characters in s and t such that the resulting strings satisfy the lexicographic order.

We can do this by comparing the characters in s and t one by one, and checking if the resulting strings satisfy the lexicographic order. If we can rearrange the characters in s and t such that the resulting strings satisfy the lexicographic order, we print "Yes". Otherwise, we print "No".

Here's an example of how we can solve this problem:

s = "yx"
t = "axy"

We can rearrange the characters in s and t as follows:

s' = "xy"
t' = "yxa"

Then, we can check if s' < t'. Since xy < yxa, we print "Yes".

In summary, we can solve this problem by comparing the characters in s and t one by one, and checking if the resulting strings satisfy the lexicographic order. If we can rearrange the characters in s and t such that the resulting strings satisfy the lexicographic order, we print "Yes". Otherwise, we print "No".

  To solve this problem, we need to determine whether it is possible to select some positive integers that satisfy the given constraints and make the sum congruent to C modulo B.

First, we need to find the multiples of A that are less than or equal to B. We can do this by using the formula:

Ax = B (mod B)

where x is the number of multiples of A that are less than or equal to B.

For example, if A = 7 and B = 14, we can find the number of multiples of 7 that are less than or equal to 14 by solving the equation:

7x = 14 (mod 14)

x = 2

So, there are 2 multiples of 7 that are less than or equal to 14.

Next, we need to select at least one integer from each of these multiples of A. We can do this by selecting the smallest integer from each multiple of A.

For example, if we select the smallest integer from each of the 2 multiples of 7 that are less than or equal to 14, we

  To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the farm excluding the roads. We can do this by subtracting the area of the roads from the total area of the farm.

First, we need to find the area of the roads. The area of the vertical road is A yards x B yards, and the area of the horizontal road is B yards x A yards. So, the total area of the roads is A x B + B x A = 2A x B + B x A = 2(A + B) x A x B.

Next, we need to find the area of the farm. The area of the farm is A x B x 2, since the farm is a rectangle with length A and width B.

Now, we can subtract the area of the roads from the area of the farm to find the area of the farm excluding the roads. The area of the farm excluding the roads is A x B x 2 - 2(A + B) x A x B = A x B x 2 - 2A x B x A = A x B x 2 - A x B x 2 = 0.

Therefore,

  The problem is to find the maximum number of people that can sit on a long seat of width X centimeters, with a minimum gap of Z centimeters between each person. The people are sitting in intervals of length Y centimeters, and there must be a gap of at least Z centimeters between the end of the seat and the last person.

To solve this problem, we can start by dividing the seat into intervals of length Y + 2Z centimeters. Since the people are sitting in intervals of length Y centimeters, we can fit as many people as possible in each interval.

We can then calculate the maximum number of people that can sit on the seat by dividing the total width of the seat by the width of each interval. Since the last person must be at least Z centimeters away from the end of the seat, we can subtract Z centimeters from the total width of the seat to get the maximum width of each interval.

For example, if the seat is 13 centimeters wide and the people are sitting in intervals of length 3 centimeters, we can fit 4 people in each interval. If we subtract 1 centimeter from the total

  This problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to sort the red points and blue points by their x-coordinates, and then pair the red points with the blue points that have the smallest x-coordinates.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. Sort the red points and blue points by their x-coordinates.
2. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.
3. Iterate through the sorted red points and blue points in parallel.
4. For each pair of red point and blue point, check if the x-coordinate of the red point is smaller than that of the blue point, and if the y-coordinate of the red point is also smaller than that of the blue point. If both conditions are true, then increment `count` by 1.
5. Print the maximum value of `count`.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N log N), where N is the number of red points and blue points. The space complexity is O(N), since we need to store the sorted red points and blue points in memory.

Here's a sample Python code that implements this algorithm:

* There are N people who will push a switch that controls the shower.
* The shower emits water for T seconds when the switch is pushed.
* Each person pushes the switch t_i seconds after the first person pushes it.

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of seconds that the shower will emit water for. We can do this by keeping track of the number of seconds that the shower has been emitting water for at each moment in time.

Let's call the number of seconds that the shower has been emitting water for at a given moment in time "x". We can represent x as an array of size N, where x[i] represents the number of seconds that the shower has been emitting water for since the i-th person pushed the switch.

We can initialize x[0] to 0, since the shower has not been emitting water at the beginning. Then, for each person i, we can update x[i] as follows:

  This problem can be solved using a data structure called a "doubly-linked list". A doubly-linked list is a type of linked list where each node has a reference to both the previous and next node in the list. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes at any position in the list.

To solve this problem, we can use a doubly-linked list to keep track of the books on the shelf. We can initialize the list with the first book on the shelf, and then process each query in order.

For each query of type L, we can insert the book at the beginning of the list. This is done by creating a new node for the book and inserting it at the beginning of the list.

For each query of type R, we can insert the book at the end of the list. This is done by creating a new node for the book and inserting it at the end of the list.

For each query of type?, we can find the position of the book in the list by iterating through the list until we find the book. We can then calculate the minimum number of books that need to be popped from the left or right

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. Let $dp[i][j]$ be the minimum number of operations required to transform the number $i$ into $j$. We can initialize $dp[i][j] = -1$ if $i \neq j$ and $dp[i][i] = 0$.

We can fill in the table using the following recurrence relation:

The process consists of placing a figure of size $2 \times 1$ on top of each column, and then reducing the height of each column by $1$ block.

To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to clear the whole field by placing figures of size $2 \times 1$ in such a way that the height of each column becomes $0$ after the second step of the process.

We can start by placing a figure of size $2 \times 1$ in the first column. After the second step of the process, the height of the first column becomes $1$ block, and the height of the other columns remains unchanged.

Next, we can place a figure of size $2 \times 1$ in the second column. After the second step of the process, the height of the second column becomes $1$ block, and the height of the first column becomes $0$

  The problem is asking you to find the minimum number of preprocess moves to apply before changes, so that it is possible to make the string $a$ equal to string $b$ with a sequence of changes from the list above.

To solve this problem, you need to find the minimum number of preprocess moves that can make the string $a$ equal to the string $b$. The preprocess moves can be applied in any order, but the number of changes you make after the preprocess moves does not matter.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this problem:

1. Check if the strings $a$ and $b$ are already equal. If they are, then the answer is 0.
2. If the strings are not equal, then check if the length of the strings is odd. If the length is odd, then the answer is -1, because it is impossible to make the strings equal by swapping characters.

  The problem is asking us to calculate the position of a frog after $k$ jumps, where the frog jumps by alternating between two types of jumps, where the first type of jump is $a$ units to the right and the second type of jump is $b$ units to the left. The problem also states that we have to answer $t$ independent queries, where $t$ is the number of queries.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that keeps track of the current position of the frog and the number of jumps it has made. We can start by initializing the current position of the frog to $0$ and the number of jumps to $0$.

For each query, we can calculate the position of the frog after the $k$th jump by checking if the number of jumps is even or odd. If the number of jumps is even, we can calculate the position of the frog by adding $a$ to the current position. If the number of jumps is odd, we can calculate the position of the frog by subtracting $b$ from the current position.

Once we have calculated the position of the frog

To solve this problem, you can use a simple algorithm that checks if a number is a good number by trying to represent it as a sum of distinct powers of 3. If a number is not a good number, you can increment it by 1 until you find a good number.

Here is an example of how you can solve this problem:

1. Read the input: The first line of the input contains the number of queries, $q$. The next $q$ lines contain the queries, each containing a positive integer $n$.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible product of $a$ and $b$ that can be achieved by applying the given operation no more than $n$ times.

We can start by observing that the operation of decreasing either $a$ or $b$ by one cannot make the value of $a$ or $b$ less than $x$ or $y$, respectively. Therefore, we can safely assume that $a \ge x$ and $b \ge y$.

We can also observe that the product of $a$ and $b$ is always greater than or equal to the product of $x$ and $y$. Therefore, we can start by setting the product of $a$ and $b$ to be equal to the product of $x$ and $y$.

Now, we can apply the operation no more than $n$ times. Each time we apply the operation, we decrease either $a$ or $b$ by one. Therefore, we can start by decreasing $a$ or $b$ by one, whichever is greater.

If $a$ is greater, we decrease $a$ by one and set $a = a -

  In this problem, we are given two positive integers $a$ and $b$. We can perform two types of operations on $a$:

1. Add $x$, where $x$ is a positive odd integer.
2. Subtract $y$, where $y$ is a positive even integer.

We can perform these operations any number of times. We need to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain $b$ from $a$.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D array $dp$ of size $1001 \times 1001$, where $dp[i][j]$ represents the minimum number of moves required to obtain $j$ from $i$.

We can initialize $dp[i][i] = 0$, as we don't need to do anything to obtain the same number.

For each $i \neq j$, we can calculate $dp[i][j]$ as follows:

1. If $j$ is odd and $i$ is odd, we can add $1$ to $i$ to get $j$. Therefore, $dp[i][j

The total number of digits pressed by our character is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + x + x1 + x11 + x111 + x1111 + \ldots$.

We can simplify this expression by noticing that the number of digits in each apartment number is equal to the number of digits in the previous apartment number plus one. Therefore, the total number of digits pressed by our character is equal to the number of digits in $x$ plus the number of

  This problem is asking you to find two sequences of integers, where each sequence has a length of at least 2, such that the sum of the elements in the first sequence, without the last element, is equal to the sum of the elements in the second sequence, without the last element.

To solve this problem, you need to find the last element in each sequence, and then remove that element from the sequence. Then, you need to find the sum of the remaining elements in each sequence, and compare them to see if they are equal.

  The problem is asking us to find the largest possible sum of an array after modifying it in a specific way. The modification involves replacing each element with its negative value, and repeating this process K times.

To solve this problem, we can start by sorting the array in descending order. This will ensure that the largest elements are replaced with their negative values first, which will have the greatest impact on the overall sum.

Next, we can use a sliding window technique to keep track of the maximum sum of the array over the last K elements. At each step, we will remove the last element from the array and add the negative of that element to the sum. We will also remove the first element from the array and add its negative to the sum.

The key insight here is that the sum of the array over the last K elements is equal to the sum of the array over the first K elements, minus the sum of the first K elements. This is because the first K elements are the same as the last K elements, but with their negative values.

By using this property, we can reduce the time complexity of the algorithm from O(nK) to O(K) by only considering the first K elements of the array

  To solve this problem, we need to find if we can partition the array into three non-empty parts with equal sums.

We can use a hash table to keep track of the sums of the elements in the array. We can iterate through the array and for each element, we can check if the sum of the elements from index 0 to the current index is equal to the sum of the elements from the current index to the end of the array. If we find a pair of indexes that satisfy this condition, we return true.

If we don't find a pair of indexes that satisfy this condition, we return false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array, because we need to iterate through the array once to find the two indexes i and j.

Let's say the closest integer that is equal to another integer is a_2. Then, we need to transform a_1 to a_2 by paying the cost of (a_1-a_2)^2 dollars.

Now, we need to find the minimum cost to transform the remaining integers to make them all equal. We can do this by finding the minimum cost to transform each integer to its closest integer that is equal to another integer.

First, we buy a cake for A yen at a cake shop. This means we have X - A yen left.

Next, we buy as many donuts as possible for B yen each, at a donut shop. We can buy as many donuts as possible because we have X - A yen left, and each donut costs B yen.

Let's say we buy D donuts. Then, we have X - A - BD yen left.

We can keep buying donuts until we don't have enough money left. So, we keep buying donuts until we have 0 yen left.

In this case, we have 1084 - 150 - 100 = 84 yen left.

Therefore, the amount you have left after shopping is 84 yen.

The base case is when `N = 1` or `M = 1`. In this case, there is only one way to arrange the dogs and monkeys, which is to place the dog or monkey in the first position.

Now, let's consider the recursive case. We can arrange the dogs and monkeys in a row in `f(N-1, M)` ways, where the last dog is placed in the first position. We can also arrange the dogs and monkeys in a row in `f(N, M-1)` ways, where the last monkey is placed in the first position.

However, we need to exclude the cases where two adjacent dogs or two adjacent monkeys are placed in the first position. We can do this by subtracting the number of

We can do this by creating a graph where each island is a node, and two islands are connected by an edge if there is a boat service between them.

Once we have the graph, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find a path between Island 1 and Island N. We can start at Island 1 and explore all the nodes that are reachable from it. If we find a node that is equal to Island N, we can print POSSIBLE. If we reach a node that is not equal to Island N, we can backtrack and try another path.

If we cannot find a path between Island 1 and Island N, we can print IMPOSSIBLE.

Once we have iterated through all the characters, we print the new string.

If the number of digits in A is less than the number of digits in B, then we know that B is greater in magnitude. If the number of digits in A is equal to the number of digits in B, then we know that A and B have the same magnitude.

Let's consider the string "apple". If Takahashi announces "apple", he will earn 1 yen for each blue card with the string "apple". He will also lose 1 yen for each red card with the string "apple". Therefore, the maximum amount of money he can earn for the string "apple" is 1 yen.

The grid is represented as a 2 x N matrix, where each element A[i][j] represents the number of candies in the square at row i and column j.

The best way to travel from the top-left square to the bottom-right square is to move right three times, then move down once, then move right once. This will result in the maximum number of candies being collected.

To calculate the maximum number of candies that can be collected, you need to calculate the sum of the candies in the top-left square, the bottom-right square, and the squares in between. The sum of the candies in the top-left square is A[1][1], the sum of the candies in the bottom-right square is A[2][N], and the sum of the candies in the squares in between is the sum of all the candies in the matrix.

Therefore, the maximum number of candies that can be collected is A[1][1] +

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by eating one candy from each box that has at least one candy. This will ensure that the number of candies in each pair of neighboring boxes is at most x.

After eating the candies, we can sort the boxes in non-decreasing order of the number of candies in each box. This will ensure that the number of candies in each pair of neighboring boxes is at most x.

We can then iterate through the sorted boxes and eat one candy from each box that has at least one candy. This will ensure that the number of candies in each pair of neighboring boxes is at most x.

The time complexity of this approach is O(N log N) and the space complexity is O(N).

The correctness of this approach can be proven as follows:

1. After eating one candy from each box that has at least one candy, the number of candies in each pair

  The problem is asking us to determine if Takahashi's statement is correct. Takahashi's statement is that there are six integers a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, b_3 whose values are fixed, and the number written in the square (i, j) is equal to a_i + b_j.

To solve this problem, we need to check if there is a possible set of integers that satisfies Takahashi's statement. We can start by considering the values of a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, b_3.

Let's consider the first row of the grid. The number written in the first square is equal to a_1 + b_1, which is 1 + 1 = 2. The number written in the second square is equal to a_2 + b_2, which is 0 + 1 = 1. The number written in the third square is equal to a_3 + b_3, which is 1 + 0 = 1.

Let's consider the second row of the grid. The number

  The problem is asking you to determine the type of contest that will be held next week based on the type of contest that was held last week. The company holds two types of contests, ABC and ARC, and they alternate between the two.

To solve this problem, you need to consider the following information:

* The company holds two types of contests, ABC and ARC.
* The company holds these two types of contests alternately: an ARC follows an ABC and vice versa.
* Given a string S representing the type of the contest held last week, print the string representing the type of the contest held this week.

To solve this problem, you can use the following steps:

1. If the string S is "ABC", then the next week's contest will be an ARC.
2. If the string S is "ARC", then the next week's contest will be an ABC.

So, if the string S is "ABC", then print "ARC" as the answer. If the string S is "ARC", then print "ABC" as the answer.

  The problem is asking for the number of integers between a and b, inclusive, that are divisible by x. To solve this problem, we need to find the number of integers between a and b that are divisible by x.

We can start by finding the number of integers between a and b, inclusive. This can be done by subtracting a from b and adding 1 to get the total number of integers between a and b.

Next, we need to find the number of integers between a and b that are divisible by x. We can do this by checking each integer between a and b and counting the number of integers that are divisible by x.

For example, if a = 4, b = 8, and x = 2, we need to find the number of integers between 4 and 8, inclusive, that are divisible by 2. We can do this by checking each integer between 4 and 8, inclusive, and counting the number of integers that are divisible by 2.

The number of integers between 4 and 8, inclusive, that are divisible by 2 is 3. This is because 4,

  The program should check if the input D is equal to 25, 24, 23, or 22. If it is, then it should print the corresponding string: "Christmas", "Christmas Eve", "Christmas Eve Eve", or "Christmas Eve Eve Eve". Otherwise, the program should print an error message.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

  The problem is asking you to find the number between 1 and N (inclusive) that can be divisible by 2 for the most number of times. To solve this problem, you need to find the number that can be divided by 2 for the longest time.

To do this, you can start by finding the number that can be divided by 2 for the longest time. You can do this by dividing each number between 1 and N (inclusive) by 2 and counting how many times you can divide it without remainder. The number that can be divided by 2 for the longest time will be the one with the highest count.

For example, if N = 7, then the numbers between 1 and 7 (inclusive) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. To find the number that can be divided by 2 for the longest time, you can start by dividing 1 by 2:

1 / 2 = 0 with remainder 1

So, 1 cannot be divided by 2 for the longest time. Next, you can divide 2 by 2:

If there is a path between A and B and between B and C, then we can conclude that there is a path between A and C that is less than or equal to d meters long, and therefore A and C can communicate.

  To solve this problem, we need to determine if Takahashi can buy the toy with the coins he has.

First, we need to calculate the total value of the coins Takahashi has. We can do this by adding the value of the A-yen coin to the value of the B-yen coin.

Next, we need to compare the total value of the coins to the cost of the toy. If the total value is greater than or equal to the cost of the toy, then Takahashi can buy the toy.

If the total value is less than the cost of the toy, then Takahashi cannot buy the toy.

In the sample input, Takahashi has 50 + 100 = 150 yen, which is greater than or equal to 120, so we print Yes.

  The problem is asking for the number of ways to select one or more cards from N cards such that the average of the integers written on the selected cards is exactly A.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to select the cards such that the average of the integers written on the selected cards is exactly A.

We can solve this problem using the concept of combinations.

Let's consider the following:

* We have N cards, and each card has an integer written on it.
* We need to select one or more cards such that the average of the integers written on the selected cards is exactly A.
* The average of the integers written on the selected cards is exactly A if the sum of the integers written on the selected cards is equal to A times the number of selected cards.

So, we need to find the number of ways to select the cards such that the sum of the integers written on the selected cards is equal to A times the number of selected cards.

We can use the formula for the number of combinations:

n! / (k! \* (n-k)!)

where n is the total number of cards, k is the number

The solution is to perform the operations in the following order:

The monster's health is initially H, and Raccoon has N special moves that can be used to decrease the monster's health. Each move has a certain amount A_i that it decreases the monster's health by.

To solve this problem, we need to find out whether it is possible for Raccoon to win the fight without using the same move twice or more. We can do this by checking whether it is possible to use all the moves to decrease the monster's health to 0 or below.

We can start by checking whether it is possible to use all the moves to decrease the monster's health to 0 or below. If it is possible, then Raccoon can win the fight without using the same move twice or more. If it is not possible, then Raccoon cannot win the fight without using the same move twice or more.

To check whether it is possible to use all the moves to decrease the monster's health to 0 or below, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by using the first

  To solve this problem, we need to find the longest even substring that can be obtained by deleting one or more characters from the end of the given string.

We can start by finding the length of the given string, which is the number of characters in the string. Let's call this length N.

Next, we need to find the longest even substring of the given string. We can do this by iterating through the string from the end and checking if the substring is even. If it is, we can keep track of the length of the substring.

If the substring is not even, we can continue iterating through the string until we find the next even substring. Once we find an even substring, we can keep track of its length and continue iterating through the string until we reach the end.

Once we have iterated through the entire string, we can print the length of the longest even substring that we found.

Here is an example of how this solution would work:

Given the string "abaababaab", we start by finding the length of the string, which is 9.

We then start iterating through the string from the end, starting with the last character. The

  To solve this problem, we need to determine if the given string S can be obtained by permuting the characters of the string "abc".

We can do this by checking if the characters in S are present in the string "abc" and if they are in the correct order.

We can use a for loop to iterate through the characters in S and check if they are present in the string "abc". If we find a character that is not present in "abc", we know that S cannot be obtained by permuting "abc".

If we find a character that is present in "abc" but not in the correct order, we need to check if the remaining characters in S are present in "abc" in the correct order. If they are, we know that S can be obtained by permuting "abc".

If we find a character that is present in "abc" and in the correct order, we can remove that character from S and continue checking the remaining characters.

If we reach the end of S without finding any characters that are not present in "abc" or not in the correct order, we know that S can be obtained by permuting "abc".

Therefore, the solution to this problem

  The problem is to find the minimum value of the sum of the products of the elements of two arrays, where the elements of one array are rearranged. The arrays are given in the input, and the output is the minimum possible value of the sum of the products of the elements of the rearranged array, modulo 998244353.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a two-dimensional array dp, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum value of the sum of the products of the elements of the rearranged array, where the first i elements of the array are rearranged, and the last j elements are not rearranged.

We can fill the dp array in a bottom-up manner, starting from the last row. For each row, we can calculate the minimum value of the sum of the products of the elements of the rearranged array, by considering all possible combinations of the first i elements of the array, and the last j elements of the array.

We can use a hash table to store the values of the sum of the products of the elements of the rearranged array for each combination of

  This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can define a function $f(i, j)$ that represents the minimum cost of buying $j$ shovels from the first $i$ shovels, where $i$ is the number of shovels and $j$ is the number of shovels to buy.

We can use the following recurrence relation to calculate $f(i, j)$:

$$f(i, j) = \min\left\{f(i-1, j-1) + a_i, f(i-1, j) + a_i\right\}$$

where $a_i$ is the cost of the $i$th shovel.

The first term in the recurrence relation represents the cost of buying the $i$th shovel and the remaining $j-1$ shovels without using any special offers. The second term in the recurrence relation represents the cost of buying the $i$th shovel and the remaining $j$ shovels using the first special offer.

We can also use the following recurrence relation to calculate the minimum cost of buying $

  The problem is to find the minimum number of edges that need to be added to a given undirected tree such that the shortest path from vertex 1 to any other vertex is at most 2. The tree is guaranteed to be connected and there are no loops or multiple edges.

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The basic idea is to start from vertex 1 and explore the tree by adding edges one by one. We keep track of the shortest distance from vertex 1 to any other vertex and update it whenever we add a new edge.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the algorithm works:

1. Initialize the shortest distance from vertex 1 to any other vertex as infinity.
2. Start from vertex 1 and explore the tree by adding edges one by one.
3. For each edge that we add, we update the shortest distance from vertex 1 to the other vertex. If the shortest distance is greater than the length of the edge, we update it to the length of the edge.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the $k$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $n$. We can do this by finding the $k$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $n$ for each test case.

For each test case, we can start with the first positive integer that is not divisible by $n$, which is $1$. Then, we can increment the integer by $n$ until we reach the $k$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $n$.

For example, if $n=3$ and $k=7$, we start with the first positive integer that is not divisible by $3$, which is $1$. Then, we increment by $3$ until we reach the $7$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $3$, which is $10$.

Therefore, the output for the first test case is $10$.

For the second test case, we start with the first positive integer that is not divisible by $4$, which is $1$. Then, we increment by $4$ until we reach the $12$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $4

  The problem is to find the list of conversations after processing all $n$ messages. The only difference between the easy and hard versions is the constraint on $n$ and $k$.

The solution is to maintain a list of conversations, where each conversation is represented by a list of friend IDs. The list is initially empty.

For each message, we need to check if the conversation with the friend ID is already displayed on the screen. If it is, then we do nothing. If not, we need to add the conversation to the list.

If the number of conversations displayed on the screen is $k$, then we remove the last conversation from the list. We then add the conversation with the friend ID to the list, and shift all the other displayed conversations down by one position.

The final list of conversations is the list of conversations in the order they are displayed on the screen.

The time complexity of the solution is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of messages. The space complexity is $O(k)$, where $k$ is the number of conversations that can be displayed on the screen.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible damage we can deal during $n$ turns. We can do this by considering all possible combinations of cards we can play during each turn, and finding the maximum damage we can deal in each combination.

Let's consider the first turn. We can play any number of cards during the first turn, as long as the total cost of the cards we play does not exceed $3$. Let's say we play $k$ cards during the first turn. We can choose any $k$ cards from the $n$ cards we received, and play them in any order. The total cost of the cards we play during the first turn is at most $3$, so the total cost of all $k$ cards is at most $3k$.

Now, let's consider the second turn. We can play any number of cards during the second turn, as long as the total cost of the cards we play does not exceed $3$. Let's say we play $k$ cards during the second turn. We can choose any $k$ cards from the $n$ cards we received, and play them in any order. The total cost of the cards we play during the

  The problem is asking us to find the number of distinct characters in a given substring of a string. The substring is defined by two indices, $l$ and $r$, which represent the starting and ending positions of the substring in the string.

The first type of query is to replace the character at position $pos$ with a new character $c$. The second type of query is to find the number of distinct characters in the substring $s[l; r]$.

To solve this problem, we can use a data structure called a hash table, which is a type of associative array that maps keys to values. In this case, we can use a hash table to keep track of the number of times each character appears in the string.

An anti-sudoku is a 9x9 field in which:

* Any number in this field is in range [1; 9]
* Each row contains at least two equal elements
* Each column contains at least two equal elements
* Each 3x3 block contains at least two equal elements

We can start by looking at the rows and columns of the given sudoku solution. We can see that each row and column contains at least two equal elements, which means that we can change at most 9 elements in each row and column to make it an anti-sudoku.

Next, we can look at the 3x3 blocks. We can see that each block contains at least two equal elements, which means that we can change at most 9 elements in each block to make it an anti-sudoku.

Now, we can combine these two constraints to get the final answer. We can change at most 9 elements in each row, column, and block to make it an anti-s

So, we need to check if the number of coins Polycarp has is equal to the sum of the number of coins each sister has. If it is, then we can distribute the coins among the sisters in such a way that the number of coins each sister has is equal. If it is not, then we cannot distribute the coins among the sisters in such a way that

We can do this by finding the position of each element in the permutation $p_i(n)$ and then finding the difference between the position of each element in the permutation and the position of the next element in the permutation.

For example, if we have the permutation $p_1(4) = [1, 2, 3, 4]$, we can find the position of each element in the permutation by finding the position of each element in the array $x$ in the permutation. So, the position of the element $1$ in the permutation $p_1(4)$ is $1$, the position of the element $2$ in the permutation $p_1(4)$ is $2$, the position of the element $3$ in the permutation $p_1(4)$ is $3$, and the position of

For each vertex, we check if it is one of the given vertices or has distance $1$ to some vertex on the path. If we find a vertex that satisfies this condition, we can return "YES" immediately.

  In this problem, we are given $n$ districts and the gang each district belongs to. We are asked to build $n-1$ two-way roads to connect all districts, such that all districts are reachable from each other and each pair of directly connected districts belongs to different gangs.

To solve this problem, we can use a graph algorithm called the "Ford-Fulkerson method" or "Edmonds-Karp algorithm". This algorithm is used to find the maximum flow in a flow network, which is a network of nodes and edges that represent the flow of resources between different parts of a system.

In our case, we can represent the districts as nodes in a graph, and the roads as edges between the nodes. Each edge has a capacity, which represents the maximum amount of flow that can pass through it. We can set the capacity of each edge to 1, since we want to build a two-way road between each pair of districts.

We can then use the Ford-Fulkerson method to find the maximum flow in the graph, which will give us the number of roads we need to build to connect all the districts. We can then use the result to determine whether it is possible

  In this problem, we are given a binary string of length $n$ and we need to find the lexicographically minimum possible string that can be obtained from the given string by performing at most $k$ moves.

A move consists of swapping two adjacent characters of the string. We can swap the same pair of adjacent characters with indices $i$ and $i+1$ arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times. Each such swap is considered a separate move.

We need to find the lexicographically minimum possible string that can be obtained from the given string by performing at most $k$ moves.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D table $dp[i][j]$ where $i$ represents the length of the string and $j$ represents the number of moves.

The value of $dp[i][j]$ represents the lexicographically minimum possible string that can be obtained from the given string of length $i$ by performing at most $j$ moves.

We can initialize the table as follows:

  This problem can be solved using a combination of greedy and dynamic programming techniques.

The first step is to sort the segments by their right endpoints. This can be done in O(n log n) time using a sorting algorithm like quicksort.

Next, we can use a greedy algorithm to remove segments one by one. At each step, we remove the segment that covers the most points. We can do this in O(n) time by keeping track of the number of points covered by each segment and removing the segment that covers the most points.

However, this greedy algorithm may not always produce the optimal solution. For example, consider the following input:

2 1
1 2

The optimal solution is to remove the first segment, but the greedy algorithm will remove the second segment instead.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array dp of size n x n, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of segments we need to remove to make sure that there are no bad points between segments i and j (inclusive). We can initialize dp[i][i] =

We can then use the following recurrence relation to update dp:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + |x_i - x_k| + |x_k - x_j|)

where k is any point between i and j.

We can then calculate the sum of the minimum distances by summing up all the elements in the dp array.

  The problem is to find the number of pairs of vertices (u, v) such that the maximum weight of an edge on a simple path between u and v does not exceed q_i.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can use a 2D array dp[i][j] to store the number of pairs of vertices (u, v) such that the maximum weight of an edge on a simple path between u and v does not exceed j.

We can initialize dp[i][j] as 0 for all i and j. Then, for each query q_i, we can calculate the number of pairs of vertices (u, v) such that the maximum weight of an edge on a simple path between u and v does not exceed j as follows:

dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - w_i]

This is because we can either choose to include the edge (u_i, v_i) in the simple path, or we can choose not to include it. If we choose to include the edge, then the maximum weight of an edge

  In this problem, we are given an array $a$ of positive integers and we need to determine if it is possible to obtain a single element by performing a series of moves.

The moves are as follows:

1. Choose two indices $i$ and $j$ such that the absolute difference between $a_i$ and $a_j$ is no more than one.
2. Remove the smallest of these two elements.
3. If two elements are equal, we can remove any of them (but exactly one).

The goal is to find if it is possible to obtain the array consisting of only one element using several (possibly, zero) such moves or not.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by removing the smallest element from the array. If the array consists of only one element, we are done. Otherwise, we can repeat the following steps:

1. Choose two indices $i$ and $j$ such that the absolute difference between $a_i$ and $a_j$ is no more than one.
2. Remove the smallest of these two elements.

  The problem is to find the bitwise AND of two large binary integers, $a$ and $b$, and then find the remainder of the result when divided by 998244353. The problem can be solved by repeatedly applying the following steps:

1. If $b$ is greater than 0, then find the bitwise AND of $a$ and $b$, and add the result to the answer.
2. Divide $b$ by 2, rounding down, and set $b$ to the result.
3. Repeat step 1 until $b$ is 0.

The answer is the final result of the above steps.

For example, if $a = 1010$ and $b = 1001$, then the bitwise AND of $a$ and $b$ is $1000$, which is added to the answer. Then $b$ is divided by 2, rounding down, and set to $101$. The bitwise AND of $a$ and $b$ is $101$, which is added to the answer. Then $b$ is divided by 2,

  To solve this problem, we need to construct an array $a$ of length $n$ such that the first $\frac{n}{2}$ elements are even, the second $\frac{n}{2}$ elements are odd, all elements are distinct and positive, and the sum of the first half equals the sum of the second half.

We can start by constructing the first $\frac{n}{2}$ elements of $a$ as even numbers from $2$ to $n$. We can then construct the second $\frac{n}{2}$ elements of $a$ as odd numbers from $1$ to $n$.

To ensure that all elements of $a$ are distinct and positive, we can use the fact that the sum of the first half equals the sum of the second half. We can use this to our advantage by ensuring that the sum of the first half is equal to the sum of the second half minus $1$. This will ensure that all elements of $a$ are distinct and positive.

For example, if $n = 6$, we can construct the array $a$ as follows:

$a = [2, 4, 1, 5, 3,

  This problem is asking us to find the number of special elements in an array. A special element is defined as an element that can be represented as the sum of two or more consecutive elements of an array.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can iterate through the array and for each element, we can check if it is equal to the sum of two or more consecutive elements. If it is, then we can count it as a special element.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Read the input: The first line of the input contains the number of test cases (t). Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the length of the array (n). The second line contains the elements of the array.
2. Initialize the count: Initialize a variable to store the number of special elements.
3. Iterate through the array: Iterate through the array and for each element, we can check if it is equal to the sum of two or more consecutive elements.
4. Check if the element is special: If the element is equal to the sum of two or more consecutive elements, then we can count it as a special element.

  In this problem, we are given a set of segments on a coordinate axis $OX$. We need to find the maximum possible size of the subset of the given set of segments such that each pair of segments in this subset either non-intersecting or one of them lies inside the other one.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by selecting the first segment in the given set of segments. Then, we can select the next segment that either non-intersects with the current selected segment or lies inside the current selected segment. We continue this process until we have selected all the segments.

The key observation is that if we select a segment that non-intersects with the current selected segment, then we can safely select the next segment without any intersection. However, if we select a segment that lies inside the current selected segment, then we need to check if the next segment non-intersects with the current selected segment. If it does, then we can safely select the next segment. If it doesn't, then we need to check if the next segment lies inside the current selected segment. If it does, then we can safely select the next segment. If it doesn't

  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of minutes between the current time and the time of the New Year.

First, we need to convert the current time to minutes. We can do this by multiplying the number of hours by 60 and adding the number of minutes. For example, if the current time is 23:55, we can convert it to minutes by multiplying 23 by 60 and adding 55, which gives us 1455 minutes.

Next, we need to find the number of minutes until the New Year. We can do this by subtracting the number of minutes from the current time from the number of minutes in a day. For example, if the current time is 23:55, and there are 1440 minutes in a day, we can find the number of minutes until the New Year by subtracting 1455 from 1440, which gives us 85 minutes.

Finally, we need to print the answer for each test case. We can do this by printing the number of minutes until the New Year for each test case.

Here is the code in Python:

  In this problem, we are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D'. The task is to find the shortest non-empty substring of $s$ such that removing this substring does not change the endpoint of the robot's path.

Let's consider a few examples to understand the problem better:

* If the string is "LRUD", the shortest non-empty substring that does not change the endpoint of the robot's path is "L".
* If the string is "LURD", the shortest non-empty substring that does not change the endpoint of the robot's path is "U".
* If the string is "RRUDU", the shortest non-empty substring that does not change the endpoint of the robot's path is "R".

Now, let's try to find the shortest non-empty substring that does not change the endpoint of the robot's path for a given string $s$. We can start by finding the first occurrence of a character that is not 'L' or 'R'. If we find such a character, we can remove the substring starting from that

  In this problem, we are given a set of $n$ students, each with a unique skill $a_i$ (where $1 \leq a_i \leq n$). We need to find the maximum size $x$ such that we can form two teams of size $x$, where each team has the same skill (i.e., all students in the same team have the same skill).

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by selecting the student with the highest skill $a_i$ and adding them to one of the teams. We can then select the next student with the highest skill $a_j$ and add them to the other team. We continue this process until we have selected all $n$ students.

The key insight here is that we can always find a valid pair of teams of size $x$ by selecting the $x$ students with the highest skills first. This is because we can always find a team of size $x$ with the same skill by selecting the $x$ students with the highest skills and then adding the remaining students to the other team.

Therefore, the maximum size $x$ for which we can form a valid pair

  The problem is to find the maximum possible cost of a tree with $n$ vertices, where each vertex has a value $a_v$ assigned to it. The cost of the tree is the sum of the distances between each vertex and the chosen vertex $v$, multiplied by the value of the vertex. The goal is to find the maximum possible cost of the tree if we can choose $v$ arbitrarily.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can define a function $f(v, i)$ that represents the maximum possible cost of the tree with $i$ vertices, where $v$ is the chosen vertex. We can calculate $f(v, i)$ as follows:

* If $i = 1$, then $f(v, 1) = 0$, since there is only one vertex in the tree, and we can't choose any other vertex as $v$.
* If $i > 1$, then we can choose any vertex $u$ as $v$, and the cost of the tree is the maximum of the following two cases:

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain an array where each element is divisible by $k$.

We can start by considering the first element of the array. If it is already divisible by $k$, we can simply increase the value of $x$ by $1$ and repeat the process for the remaining elements.

If the first element is not divisible by $k$, we need to find the smallest integer $i$ such that $a_i$ is divisible by $k$. We can do this by checking each element of the array and finding the smallest element that is divisible by $k$. Once we have found the smallest element, we can add $x$ to that element and increase $x$ by $1$.

We can repeat this process for the remaining elements of the array. If we need to add $x$ to an element that is not divisible by $k$, we can find the smallest integer $i$ such that $a_i$ is divisible by $k$ and add $x$ to that element.

Once we have processed all the elements of the array, we can simply increase $x$ by $1$

  This problem is a classic example of a greedy algorithm. The goal is to assign cookies to children in a way that maximizes the number of content children.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start by considering the first child. We have a cookie and the greed factor of the first child is 1. Since the size of the cookie is 1, we can assign the cookie to the first child and make them content.

Next, we consider the second child. We have two cookies and the greed factor of the second child is 2. Since the size of the first cookie is 1, we cannot assign it to the second child. However, we have a second cookie with a size of 2, which is greater than the greed factor of the second child. We can assign this cookie to the second child and make them content.

Now, we consider the third child. We have two cookies and the greed factor of the third child is 3. Since the size of the first cookie is 1, we cannot assign it to the third child. However, we have a second cookie with a size of 2, which is less than the greed factor of the

  To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can start by defining the first row of the Pascal's triangle as [1].

For each subsequent row, we can calculate the next row by adding the previous row and the row above it. For example, the second row of the Pascal's triangle is [1, 1, 1], which is calculated by adding [1] and [1, 1].

We can continue this process until we reach the kth row. Once we have the kth row, we can return it.

To optimize the space complexity, we can use a single variable to store the previous row and the row above it. This way, we only need to store two values instead of the entire row.

For example, if we are calculating the 10th row of the Pascal's triangle, we can use a single variable to store the 9th row and the 8th row. This way, we only need to store two values instead of the entire 10th row.

Overall, the time complexity of this solution is O(k), and the space complexity is O(1).

  To solve this problem, we can use a bitwise operation to count the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of the input integer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Convert the input integer to a binary string.
2. Use a bitwise AND operation with the input integer and a mask that has all the bits set to 1, except for the most significant bit. This will clear all the bits except for the most significant bit.
3. Repeat step 2 until the result is 0.
4. The number of times the bitwise AND operation is performed is equal to the number of '1' bits in the input integer.

Here's an example of how this solution would work:

Suppose we have the input integer 10 (in binary, this is 1010).

1. Convert the input integer to a binary string: 1010
2. Use a bitwise AND operation with the input integer and a mask that has all the bits set to 1, except for the most significant bit: 1010 & 111111111

  To solve this problem, we need to add 1 to the integer represented by the array of digits. We can do this by iterating through the array from the last digit to the first digit, and incrementing the digit at each position by 1 if it is less than 9. If the digit is 9, we set it to 0 and carry a 1 to the next digit. We repeat this process until we reach the first digit, and if the first digit is 9, we set it to 0 and carry a 1 to the next digit.

For example, let's say we have the array [1, 2, 3]. We start by incrementing the digit at the last position, which is 3. Since 3 is less than 9, we set it to 4 and carry a 0 to the next position. The array now looks like [1, 2, 4].

Next, we move to the second-to-last position, which is 2. Since 2 is less than 9, we set it to 3 and carry a 1 to the next position. The array now looks like [1, 3, 4].

  The problem is to find the number of points in a two-dimensional plane with coordinates (X_i, Y_i) such that the distance from the origin (0, 0) is at most D.

To solve this problem, we can use the distance formula, which is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of the coordinates. In this case, the distance from the origin to a point (X_i, Y_i) is given by:

\sqrt{X_i^2 + Y_i^2}

We can use this formula to find the distance from the origin to each of the N points, and then count the number of points that have a distance less than or equal to D.

To do this, we can first calculate the distance from the origin to each point, and then use a loop to count the number of points that have a distance less than or equal to D.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Python:

  To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given integer N is a Harshad number. A Harshad number is an integer X that is divisible by f(X), where f(X) is the sum of the digits in X when written in base 10.

To check if N is a Harshad number, we can calculate f(N) and then check if N is divisible by f(N). If N is divisible by f(N), then N is a Harshad number.

Here's an example of how to solve this problem:

1. Read the input N from Standard Input.
2. Calculate f(N) by adding up the digits in N when written in base 10. For example, if N = 12, then f(N) = 1 + 2 = 3.
3. Check if N is divisible by f(N). If N is divisible by f(N), then N is a Harshad number.

To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of travel for each spot when the visit to that spot is canceled. We can do this by considering the different possible courses of the trip and the cost of travel for each course.

Let's consider the course of the trip when the visit to Spot i is canceled. There are two possible courses:

1. The first course is 0 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow -1 \rightarrow 0, where we start at the point with coordinate 0, visit Spot 1 at the point with coordinate 5, visit Spot 2 at the point with coordinate -1, and return to the point with coordinate 0. The cost of travel for this course is 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 yen.

If the input character is not 'a', then we need to check if it is 'e'. If it is, then we know that it is a vowel. We can print "vowel" and end the program.

If the input character is not 'a' or 'e', then we need to check if it is 'i'. If it is, then we know that it is a vowel. We can print "vowel" and end the program.

If the input character is not 'a', 'e', or 'i', then we need to check if it is 'o'. If it is, then we know that it is a vowel. We can print "vowel" and end the program.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of new stones that Jiro needs to place on the board to convert all the stones to the same color.

Let's consider the case where Jiro places a new black stone to the right end of the row of stones. In this case, all the white stones between the new black stone and the next white stone will become black. Therefore, we can convert all the white stones to black by placing a new black stone to the right end of the row.

Similarly, if Jiro places a new white stone to the left end of the row of stones, all the black stones between the new white stone and the next black stone will become white. Therefore, we can convert all the black stones to white by placing a new white stone to the left end of the row.

In either case, we can achieve Jiro's purpose by placing one stone. Therefore, the minimum number of new stones that Jiro needs to place is 1.

Therefore, the output is 1.

  To solve this problem, we need to determine whether the concatenation of a and b in this order is a square number.

First, we need to convert the input a and b into a string. We can do this by concatenating the two integers into a single string.

Next, we need to calculate the square of the concatenated string. We can do this by taking the length of the string and squaring it.

For example, if a = 1 and b = 21, the concatenated string would be "121". The length of this string is 3, so the square of the concatenated string would be 3^2 = 9.

Finally, we need to compare the square of the concatenated string to the original integers a and b. If the square of the concatenated string is equal to a or b, then we know that the concatenation of a and b in this order is a square number.

If the concatenation of a and b in this order is a square number, we print "Yes". Otherwise, we print "No".

In the sample input, the concatenated string is "121", which has a length of

  The problem is to find the maximum number of indices i such that a_i = X, where X is a given integer. The goal is to maximize the count by making optimal choices.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array dp of size N x X, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of indices i such that a_i = j.

We can fill the dp array in the following way:

* dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + 1 if a_i = j
* dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1]) if a_i!= j

The base case is dp[0][j] = 1 if a_0 = j, 0 otherwise.

The answer is the maximum value in the dp array.

The time complexity of this solution is O(NX), where N is the length of the input sequence and X is the value of X. The space complexity is O(NX).

Let's say we have an N x N square grid with N rows and N columns.

If we paint exactly A squares white, we can divide the number of squares in each row and column by 2 to find the number of black squares in each row and column.

For example, if we have a 3 x 3 square grid with 4 white squares, we can divide the number of squares in each row and column by 2 to find the number of black squares in each row and column.

Row 1: 3 / 2 = 1.5 black squares
Row 2: 3 / 2 = 1.5 black squares
Row 3: 3 / 2 = 1.5 black squares

We can start by converting N to a string. We can do this by using the `str()` function in Python.

Next, we can use the `in` operator to check if the digit 9 appears in the string representation of N.

If the digit 9 appears in the string representation of N, we print "Yes". Otherwise, we print "No".

Here's the code:

In this code, we first take input from the user and store it in the variable `n`.

We then convert `n` to a string using the `str()` function.

Next, we use the `in` operator to check if the digit 9 appears in the string representation of `n`. If it does, we print "Yes". Otherwise, we print "No".

Note that we use the `find()` method to check if the digit 9 appears in the string

To solve this problem, we need to find a way to distribute the packs so that each student gets the same number of candies. We can do this by finding a way to distribute the packs so that the total number of candies in each pack is equal.

Let's say we have three packs with a, b, and c candies, respectively. We can distribute the packs so that each student gets the same number of candies by giving one pack to each student. For example, if we have three packs with 10, 20, and 30 candies, we can give the first pack to one student, the second pack to the other student, and the third pack to the remaining student. Then, each student will get 10, 20, and 30 candies, respectively.

  The problem is asking you to determine whether a given string S follows the postal code format in Atcoder Kingdom. The format is as follows:

* The postal code in Atcoder Kingdom is A+B+1 characters long.
* The (A+1)-th character is a hyphen -.
* The other characters are digits from 0 through 9.

To solve this problem, you need to check if the given string S follows this format. You can do this by checking the length of S, the first character, and the remaining characters.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Check the length of S. If it is not equal to A+B+1, then it does not follow the format.
2. Check the first character of S. If it is not a hyphen -, then it does not follow the format.
3. Check the remaining characters of S. If they are not all digits from 0 through 9, then it does not follow the format.

If all of these conditions are met, then S follows the postal code format in Atcoder Kingdom.

In summary, the solution is to check the length

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved so that it connects with the first rectangle.

We can start by drawing the two rectangles on the table, as shown in the figure. We can see that the first rectangle covers the vertical range of [0,1] and the horizontal range of [a,a+W], while the second rectangle covers the vertical range of [1,2] and the horizontal range of [b,b+W].

We need to find the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved so that it connects with the first rectangle. We can do this by finding the minimum distance between the two rectangles.

Let's call the horizontal position of the second rectangle "x". We can see that the second rectangle needs to be moved to the left by a distance of x-b, and it needs to be moved to the right by a distance of a+W-x.

We want to find the minimum distance between the two rectangles, which is the minimum of the two distances. We can calculate these distances as follows:

Distance 1: x-b
Distance 2: a+W-x

  The problem is to find all the integers between A and B (inclusive) that are either within the K smallest integers or within the K largest integers.

To solve this problem, we can first find the K smallest and K largest integers between A and B. We can do this by sorting the integers between A and B in ascending order and then taking the first K integers as the smallest and the last K integers as the largest.

Once we have the smallest and largest integers, we can find all the integers that satisfy the condition by iterating through the integers between A and B and checking if they are either within the K smallest integers or within the K largest integers.

Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:

1. Read the input values A, B, and K from Standard Input.
2. Sort the integers between A and B in ascending order.
3. Take the first K integers as the smallest integers and the last K integers as the largest integers.
4. Iterate through the integers between A and B and check if they are either within the K smallest integers or within the K largest integers. If they are, print them.

  The problem is asking if it is possible that there are exactly X cats among the A + B animals, where A is the number of known cats and B is the number of unknown animals.

To solve this problem, we need to consider two cases:

Case 1: A = X
In this case, we know that there are X cats among the A + B animals, and we can easily verify that this is possible by checking that A + B = X + X = 2X.

Case 2: A < X
In this case, we know that there are fewer cats than X among the A + B animals. We can rule out this possibility by checking that A + B < X + X = 2X, which is not possible.

Therefore, the answer is YES if A = X, and NO otherwise.

  The problem is asking for the number of grams of sand that will be left in the upper bulb after t seconds, where t is the number of seconds that the sandglass runs for.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of grams of sand that will be consumed by the sandglass during the first t seconds. We can do this by multiplying the rate of sand consumption (1 gram per second) by the number of seconds that the sandglass runs for (t).

So, the number of grams of sand that will be consumed by the sandglass during the first t seconds is:

1 gram per second x t seconds = t grams

Now, we need to subtract the number of grams of sand that will be consumed by the sandglass during the first t seconds from the initial number of grams of sand in the upper bulb.

So, the number of grams of sand that will be left in the upper bulb after t seconds is:

X grams - t grams = X - t grams

Therefore, the number of grams of sand that will be left in the upper bulb after t seconds is X -

  To solve this problem, we need to compute the product of N integers A_1,..., A_N. However, if the result exceeds 10^18, we need to print -1 instead.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input: The first line of input contains an integer N, which is the number of integers to be read. The next N lines contain the integers A_1,..., A_N.
2. Initialize the result: Set the result to 1.
3. Compute the product: Multiply the current result by the next integer in the input. If the result exceeds 10^18, set the result to -1 and break out of the loop.
4. Print the result: Print the result as an integer, or -1 if the result exceeds 10^18.

Here's an example of how this solution would work for the sample input:

  To determine if E869120 can pay exactly N yen using only his 1-yen and 500-yen coins, we need to count the number of 1-yen coins and 500-yen coins that E869120 has.

We know that E869120 has A 1-yen coins and infinitely many 500-yen coins. We can assume that A is a positive integer between 0 and 1000, inclusive.

We can start by counting the number of 1-yen coins that E869120 has. We know that A is a positive integer, so we can start with A 1-yen coins.

Next, we need to count the number of 500-yen coins that E869120 has. We know that there are infinitely many 500-yen coins, so we can assume that E869120 has at least N/500 500-yen coins.

Now, we need to determine if E8691

  To solve this problem, we need to determine whether Takahashi found the food delicious or not. We can do this by checking the following conditions:

1. If the "best-by" date of the food is X or more days earlier, then Takahashi will not find it delicious.
2. If the "best-by" date of the food is X+1 or more days earlier, then Takahashi will get a stomachache.
3. If Takahashi ate the food B days after he bought it, then he will not get a stomachache.

We can use these conditions to determine whether Takahashi found the food delicious or not. If the "best-by" date is X or more days earlier, then Takahashi will not find it delicious. If the "best-by" date is X+1 or more days earlier, then Takahashi will get a stomachache. If Takahashi ate the food B days after he bought it, then he will not get a stomachache.

Therefore, we can print "delicious" if Takahashi found the food delicious, "safe"

  To solve this problem, we need to find the largest square number not exceeding N. A square number is an integer that can be represented as the square of an integer.

We can start by finding the largest square number that is less than or equal to N. We can do this by finding the largest integer that is less than or equal to the square root of N.

For example, if N = 10, then the largest integer that is less than or equal to the square root of N is 3. Therefore, the largest square number not exceeding N is 9 = 3 × 3.

Therefore, the solution is to find the largest integer that is less than or equal to the square root of N, and then multiply it by itself to get the largest square number not exceeding N.

  The problem is asking for the minimum possible total number of votes obtained by Takahashi and Aoki when AtCoDeer checked the report for the N-th time. The report shows the ratio of the current numbers of votes the two candidates have obtained, but not the actual numbers of votes.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible total number of votes obtained by Takahashi and Aoki when AtCoDeer checked the report for the N-th time. We can start by assuming that the total number of votes obtained by Takahashi and Aoki at the beginning is 1.

At the first check, the ratio of the current numbers of votes is 2:3, which means that Takahashi has 2 votes and Aoki has 3 votes.

At the second check, the ratio of the current numbers of votes is 1:1, which means that Takahashi has 1 vote and Aoki has 1 vote.

At the third check, the ratio of the current numbers of votes is 3:2, which means that Takahashi has 3 votes and Aoki has 2 votes.

We can see that the total number of votes

  To solve this problem, we need to check if all the characters in the string S are different. We can do this by using a set to keep track of the characters we've seen so far.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize an empty set, called "seen".
2. Iterate through each character in the string S.
3. If the character is not in the set "seen", add it to the set "seen".
4. If the character is already in the set "seen", then we know that there are duplicate characters in the string, so we print "no".
5. If we reach the end of the string and all the characters are unique, then we print "yes".

Here's the pseudocode for the solution:

seen = set()

  The problem is asking us to find the minimum number of people who have to change their directions when appointing one person as the leader and commanding the rest to face in the direction of the leader.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by appointing the person who is facing east as the leader. This person will not have to change their direction, so we can reduce the number of people who have to change their directions by 1.

Next, we can consider the person who is facing west. If we appoint this person as the leader, they will have to turn around to face east. This means that the person who was facing east before will not have to change their direction, and the person who was facing west before will have to change their direction.

We can continue this process by considering the person who is facing east after the leader has turned around, and so on. We can keep doing this until we have considered all the people in the row.

The key insight here is that we can always appoint the person who is facing east as the leader, because they will not have to change their direction. This means that we can reduce the number of people who have to change their directions

  The problem is asking for the number of roads that connect to each city. To solve this problem, we can use a hash table to keep track of the roads that connect to each city.

We start by reading in the input, which consists of the number of cities and roads, and the connections between the cities. We then initialize a hash table with the number of cities as its size.

Next, we iterate through the connections and add each road to the hash table. For each road, we check if the city it connects to is already in the hash table. If it is, we increment the count for that city. If it's not, we add the city to the hash table and set the count to 1.

Finally, we print the count for each city.

Here is the code in Python:
```
# Read in the number of cities and roads
n, m = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize the hash table
city_counts = {}

# Iterate through the connections and add each road to the hash table

  The maximum value that can be displayed as your grade is 25.

Here's how to arrive at this answer:

1. The examination consists of N questions, and the score allocated to each question is s_i.
2. The score for each question is a multiple of 10, and the system displays 0 as the grade if the score is a multiple of 10.
3. The maximum score that can be achieved is 100, and the maximum grade that can be displayed is 25.
4. If the 10-point and 15-point questions are answered correctly and the 5-point question is not, the score will be 10 + 15 = 25.
5. If the 5-point question is also answered correctly, the score will be 25 + 5 = 30.
6. However, if the 5-point question is not answered correctly, the score will be 25, which is a multiple of 10 and will be displayed as 0.

Therefore, the maximum value that can be displayed as your grade is 25.

  The problem is to find the largest number of different letters contained in both X and Y when cutting the string at the optimal position.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array dp of size N x N, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of different letters contained in both X and Y when cutting the string between the i-th and j-th letters.

We can fill the dp array in the following way:

* dp[i][i] = 1, for all i from 1 to N
* dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 1, for all i from 1 to N and j from i+1 to N

The reason for this is that when we cut the string between the i-th and j-th letters, the number of different letters contained in both X and Y is equal to the number of different letters contained in both X and Y when cutting the string between the i+1-th and j-1-th letters plus 1.

We can then find the optimal position to cut the string by finding the

  The problem is asking us to predict the weather tomorrow based on the current weather today. The weather in Takahashi's town changes day by day in a cycle of Sunny, Cloudy, and Rainy.

To solve this problem, we need to find the next day in the cycle. We can do this by keeping track of the current day and the next day. If the current day is Sunny, the next day will be Cloudy. If the current day is Cloudy, the next day will be Rainy. If the current day is Rainy, the next day will be Sunny.

We can use a variable to keep track of the current day and a variable to keep track of the next day. We can initialize the current day to the first day in the cycle (Sunny). We can then use a conditional statement to determine the next day based on the current day.

Here is the solution in words:

1. Initialize the current day to Sunny.

Plan 1: The fee will be A×T yen when you park for T hours.
Plan 2: The fee will be B yen, regardless of the duration.

We need to find the minimum fee when parking for N hours. We can start by considering Plan 2, where the fee is B yen regardless of the duration.

Let's assume that the minimum fee is x yen. We can calculate the fee for N hours using Plan 2:

Fee = B

We need to find the minimum value of x such that Fee = A×T when we park for T hours.

We can start by considering the case where T = 1 hour. In this case, the fee will be B yen.

If we park for 2 hours, the fee will be 2B yen.
If we park for 3 hours, the fee will be 3B yen.
And so on.

We can see that the fee for each hour is B yen, so the total fee for

  The problem is asking for the expected value of the total execution time of a code that solves a problem with N test cases, where M of those cases are known to be TLE. The code is able to solve each of the M cases with 1/2 probability in 1900 milliseconds, and correctly solve each of the other N-M cases without fail in 100 milliseconds.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected value of the total execution time of the code. We can do this by summing the probability of each case and multiplying it by the execution time of the code.

Let's first calculate the probability of each case. There are N total cases, and M of them are TLE. The probability of a case being TLE is 1/2, since the code is able to solve each of the M cases with 1/2 probability.

The probability of a case being solved correctly is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The probability of a case being solved incorrectly is 1/2.

Now, let's calculate the expected value of the total execution time of the code. We can do this by sum

  The problem is asking you to find the smallest lowercase English letter that does not occur in the given string S. If every lowercase English letter occurs in S, then print None instead.

To solve this problem, you can use a simple approach. You can iterate through all the lowercase English letters and check if they occur in S or not. If a letter does not occur in S, then it is the smallest letter that does not occur in S.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize a variable smallest to None.
2. Iterate through all the lowercase English letters.
3. For each letter, check if it occurs in S or not. If it does not occur in S, then smallest = letter.

Let's consider the first element of the array, X_1. The median of X_1, X_2,..., X_N is the (N+1)/2-th largest value among X_1, X_2,..., X_N. Since N is even, the (N+1)/2-th largest value is the median of X_2, X_3,..., X_N.

Now, let's consider the second element of the array, X_2. The median of X_1, X_2,..., X_N excluding X_2 is the (N-1)/2-th largest value among X_1, X_3,..., X_N. Since N is even, the (N-1)/2-th largest value is the median of X_1, X_3,..., X_N.

We can continue this process for each element of the array, and find the median of the subarray excluding the current element.

The first step is to sort the sticks in non-decreasing order. This is done by comparing each pair of sticks and swapping them if the first stick is smaller than the second stick.

Next, we need to find the maximum possible area of the rectangle. We can do this by finding the maximum possible area of a rectangle that can be formed using the first stick and the last stick. We can do this by finding the maximum possible area of a rectangle that can be formed using the first stick and the last stick, and then finding the maximum possible area of a rectangle that can be formed using the second stick and the second-to-last stick. We can continue this process until we have found the maximum possible area of a rectangle that can be formed using all four sticks.

The maximum possible area of a rectangle that can be formed using four sticks is the maximum of the areas of all possible rectangles that can be formed using these sticks. We can find the maximum area of a rectangle by finding the maximum of the

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of chocolate pieces eaten by all participants during the camp. We can do this by adding up the number of chocolate pieces eaten by each participant.

The number of chocolate pieces eaten by each participant is given by the formula:

(A_i + 1) + (2A_i + 1) +... + (N \* A_i + 1)

where A_i is the number of days the i-th participant eats chocolate pieces.

We can simplify this formula by noticing that the number of chocolate pieces eaten by each participant is equal to the number of days the participant eats chocolate pieces, plus one.

Therefore, the total number of chocolate pieces eaten by all participants is:

  The problem is asking you to find a way to write the number 1222 using the symbols + and -, such that the formula A op1 B op2 C op3 D = 7 holds.

The given input guarantees that there is a solution, and there is only one solution.

To solve this problem, you can start by writing the number 1222 as a sum of four terms, using the symbols + and -. For example, you could write it as:

1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7

Now, you need to replace each of the symbols op1, op2, and op3 with either + or -, so that the formula holds.

For example, you could replace op1 with +, op2 with -, and op3 with +, like this:

1 + 2 - 2 + 2 = 7

This is a valid solution, and it is the only valid solution.

So, the final answer is:

  The problem is asking for the earliest time at which the kangaroo can reach the nest. The kangaroo can either stay at his current position, or jump to the left or right. The distance between the kangaroo's current position and the nest is X.

To find the earliest time, we need to find the smallest integer t such that the kangaroo can reach the nest at time t. We can start by considering the case where the kangaroo stays at his current position. If the kangaroo stays at his current position, it will take t = X steps to reach the nest.

However, we can do better than this. We can consider the case where the kangaroo jumps to the left. If the kangaroo jumps to the left, it will take t = X - 1 steps to reach the nest. Similarly, if the kangaroo jumps to the right, it will take t = X + 1 steps to reach the nest.

We can now consider the case where the kangaroo jumps to the left or right. If the kangaroo jumps to the left, it will take t

  To solve this problem, we need to check if the given 4-digit integer N has three or more consecutive same digits.

We can start by checking if the first digit of N is the same as the second digit. If they are the same, we can check if the second digit is the same as the third digit. If they are the same, we can check if the third digit is the same as the fourth digit. If they are all the same, then we have found three consecutive same digits.

If we find three consecutive same digits, we can print "Yes" as the answer. Otherwise, we can print "No" as the answer.

Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:

1. Read the input N from Standard Input.
2. Check if the first digit of N is the same as the second digit. If they are the same, we can check if the second digit is the same as the third digit. If they are the same, we can check if the third digit is the same as the fourth digit.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of different altars that Ringo can build.

First, we need to find the number of different combinations of three parts that satisfy the conditions. We can do this by finding the number of ways to choose three parts from the three categories, subject to the condition that the middle part is strictly greater than the upper part and the lower part is strictly greater than the middle part.

Let's denote the number of ways to choose three parts from the three categories as N. We can calculate N as follows:

N = (N_upper x N_middle x N_lower) / (N_middle x N_lower)

where N_upper, N_middle, and N_lower are the number of parts in each category.

We can calculate N_upper, N_middle, and N_lower as follows:

N_upper = N
N_middle = N - 1
N_lower = N - 2

Therefore, we can calculate N as follows:

N = (N x (N - 1) x (N - 2)) / ((N - 1) x (N -

  The problem is asking you to compare two hexadecimal numbers represented by two letters, X and Y. The letters can be any of A, B, C, D, E, or F.

To solve this problem, you need to convert the letters to their corresponding hexadecimal values. The hexadecimal values of A, B, C, D, E, and F are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively.

Once you have the hexadecimal values of X and Y, you can compare them directly. If X is smaller, print <; if Y is smaller, print >; if they are equal, print =.

For example, if X is A and Y is B, the hexadecimal values of X and Y are 10 and 11, respectively. Since 10 is smaller than 11, you should print <.

So, the solution to this problem is to convert the letters to their corresponding hexadecimal values and then compare them directly.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of bomb squares that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent to each empty square in the grid. We can do this by using a two-dimensional array to keep track of the number of bomb squares adjacent to each empty square.

We can start by initializing the array with all zeros. This means that initially, there are no bomb squares adjacent to any empty square.

Next, we need to iterate through each row of the grid and count the number of bomb squares that are adjacent to each empty square. We can do this by using a nested loop to iterate through each row and column of the grid.

Inside the nested loop, we can check if the current square is empty (i.e., it contains a dot). If it is, we can check if there is a bomb square adjacent to it (i.e., if there is a bomb square in the same row, column, or diagonal as the current square). If there is, we can increment the corresponding entry in the array by 1.

Once we have counted the number of bomb squares that are adjacent to each empty square, we can print the array as the final answer.

  The problem is asking us to find the maximum number of books that can be read within a time limit of K minutes. The time it takes to read a book from the top of a desk is given by the corresponding value in the A_i and B_i arrays.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by choosing the desk with the book that takes the least time to read. If there are multiple books on the same desk, we can choose the book that takes the least time to read.

We can repeat this process until we have read all the books or we have reached the time limit of K minutes. We can keep track of the total time it takes to read all the books and the number of books we have read.

The maximum number of books we can read within K minutes is the number of books we have read at the end of the process.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Choose the desk with the book that takes the least time to read. If there are multiple books on the same desk, choose the book that takes the least time to read.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum amount of money required to prepare X A-pizzas and Y B-pizzas.

We can start by considering the case where Nakahashi buys only A-pizzas and B-pizzas. The total cost of A-pizzas is X times A yen, and the total cost of B-pizzas is Y times B yen. Therefore, the total cost of A-pizzas and B-pizzas is X times A yen + Y times B yen.

However, we can do better by buying two AB-pizzas and rearranging them into one A-pizza and one B-pizza. The cost of two AB-pizzas is 2 times C yen. Therefore, the cost of one A-pizza and one B-pizza is 2 times C yen + 1 times A yen + 1 times B yen.

Now, we need to find the minimum amount of money required to prepare X A-pizzas and Y B-pizzas. We can do this by finding the minimum amount of money required to

  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive divisors of N! modulo 10^9+7.

First, we need to find the factorial of N. We can do this by multiplying N by (N-1) and then by (N-2) and so on until we reach 1.

Once we have the factorial of N, we need to find the number of positive divisors of it. We can do this by dividing the factorial by all the positive divisors of N and counting the number of times each divisor appears.

For example, if N = 3, then the factorial of N is 6. The positive divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3. So, the number of positive divisors of 6 is 3.

To find the number of positive divisors of N!, we need to divide N! by all the positive divisors of N and count the number of times each divisor appears. We can do this by using a loop to iterate through all the positive divisors of N and counting the number of times each divisor appears in the factorial of N.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the largest perfect power that is at most X. A perfect power is an integer that can be represented as b^p, where b is an integer not less than 1 and p is an integer not less than 2.

We can start by finding the largest perfect power that is less than or equal to X. We can do this by finding the largest integer b such that b^p is less than or equal to X. We can do this by using a binary search algorithm.

We can start by setting b = 1 and p = 2. We can then check if b^p is less than or equal to X. If it is, we can update our answer and move on to the next iteration. If it is not, we can decrease p by 1 and try again.

We can continue this process until we find the largest perfect power that is less than or equal to X. Once we have found this perfect power, we can print it as our answer.

For example, if X = 10, we can start by setting b = 1 and p = 2. We can then check if 1^2 is less than or equal

  The problem is asking us to find the maximum number of layers that can be formed by stacking a set of round mochi (rice cakes) in a kagami mochi. The kagami mochi is a pile of X round mochi (rice cakes) stacked vertically where each mochi (except the bottom one) has a smaller diameter than that of the mochi directly below it.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of layers that can be formed by stacking the given set of round mochi. We can do this by analyzing the diameters of the mochi and finding the maximum number of layers that can be formed by stacking them in a way that satisfies the condition that each mochi has a smaller diameter than that of the mochi directly below it.

Let's consider a set of N round mochi with diameters d_1, d_2,..., d_N. We can stack these mochi in a kagami mochi by starting with the largest diameter mochi and then stacking the remaining mochi on top of it in a way that satisfies the condition that each mochi has a smaller diameter than that of the mochi

  To solve this problem, we need to find the longest substring of the input string that starts with A and ends with Z.

We can do this by iterating through the characters of the input string and keeping track of the current substring. When we encounter a character that is not in the substring, we can check if it is the first character of the substring. If it is, we can add it to the substring. If it is not, we can check if it is the last character of the substring. If it is, we can add it to the substring.

We can also keep track of the maximum length of the substring that we have found so far. When we find a substring that is longer than the current maximum, we can update the maximum.

At the end, we can print the maximum length of the substring that we have found.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Python:
```
s = input()

max_length = 0
substring = ""

for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] in substring:

  The problem is asking for the maximum number of operations that Snuke can perform on the blackboard. The operation is to divide each even number on the blackboard by 2. The constraint is that all the numbers on the blackboard are positive integers.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of operations that Snuke can perform. We can do this by analyzing the numbers on the blackboard and determining when Snuke can no longer perform the operation.

Let's consider the following cases:

1. If all the numbers on the blackboard are even, Snuke can perform the operation as many times as there are even numbers on the blackboard.
2. If there is an odd number on the blackboard, Snuke can no longer perform the operation.

Now, let's consider the input:

N = 3
A_1 = 8
A_2 = 12
A_3 = 40

In this case, all the numbers on the blackboard are even, so Snuke can perform the operation as many times as there are even numbers on the blackboard, which is 3 times.

==============================
  To solve this problem, we need to find the power of Snuke after he exercises N times. We can do this by multiplying the power by the number of times he exercises.

Let's say Snuke exercises for the i-th time, and his power becomes P after that. Then, the power after the (i+1)-th time will be P \* (i+1).

We can see that the power after the i-th time is equal to the power after the (i-1)-th time multiplied by i. This means that the power after the N-th time will be equal to the power after the (N-1)-th time multiplied by N.

So, we can write the formula for the power after the N-th time as:

P_N = P_1 \* N

where P_1 is the power after the first time, and P_N is the power after the N-th time.

Since the answer can be extremely large, we need to print the answer modulo 10^9+7. We can do this by taking the remainder of the result of the

The score of each player is the sum of the numbers written on the cards they have taken. The goal is to find the difference between Alice's score and Bob's score when both players take the optimal strategy to maximize their scores.

To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. The optimal strategy for Alice is to take the card with the highest number, and the optimal strategy for Bob is to take the card with the lowest number.

Here's how we can implement this strategy:

1. Alice starts by taking the card with the highest number.
2. Bob takes the card with the lowest number.
3. The game continues with the next card, and the process repeats.

The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob leads to the highest possible difference between their scores. When both players take the optimal strategy, Alice's score is the sum of the numbers written on the cards she has taken, and Bob's score is the sum of the numbers written on the cards

  To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the number of correct answers and penalties for each problem.

We can do this by creating a data structure to store the number of correct answers and penalties for each problem. We can use a hash table or a dictionary to map each problem to its corresponding number of correct answers and penalties.

We can then iterate through the input and update the data structure for each problem. If the verdict is AC, we can increment the number of correct answers for that problem. If the verdict is WA, we can increment the number of penalties for that problem.

Once we have processed all the input, we can print the number of correct answers and penalties by accessing the corresponding values in the data structure.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Python:

  This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning when she can use Special Move at most j times and there are i monsters left to fight.

We can initialize dp[i][0] = i, since Fennec needs to do Attack i times to defeat all the monsters.

For dp[i][j], we can consider two cases:

1. Fennec uses Special Move on the i-th monster. In this case, we need to do Attack (i-1) times on the remaining monsters.
2. Fennec does not use Special Move on the i-th monster. In this case, we need to do Attack (i-1) times on the remaining monsters and then do Special Move on the i-th monster.

We can use the following recurrence relation to calculate dp[i][j]:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1] + i, d

* A type-B robot can cover a distance of 10 units from its original position to the ball and back.

Now, let's consider the distance that each robot can cover when it is activated.

* When a type-A robot is activated, it will move to the position of the ball on the line y = a, collect the ball, move back to its original position (0, a), and deactivate itself. The distance covered by the robot is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 units.
* When a type-B robot is activated, it will move to the position of the ball on the line y = b, collect the ball, move back to its original position (K, b), and deactivate itself. The distance covered by the robot is 10 + 2 + 10 = 18 units.

The fare for trains is A if you buy ordinary tickets, and B if you buy an unlimited ticket. Similarly, the fare for buses is C if you buy ordinary tickets, and D if you buy an unlimited ticket.

To solve this problem, you need to find the optimal choices for trains and buses. The optimal choices are the ones that minimize the total fare.

For trains, the optimal choice is to buy an unlimited ticket for 300 yen. This is because the fare for trains is 600 yen if you buy ordinary tickets, and 300 yen if you buy an unlimited ticket. Therefore, buying an unlimited ticket for 300 yen is the optimal choice for trains.

For buses, the optimal choice is to buy ordinary tickets for 220 yen. This is because the fare for buses is 420 yen if you buy ordinary tickets, and 220

  The problem is asking us to find the number of possible orders in which the people were standing yesterday, based on the information provided by each person.

To solve this problem, we can use a technique called "backtracking". We will start by considering the first person, and then recursively consider the remaining people. For each person, we will consider all possible orders in which they could have been standing, and then recursively consider the remaining people.

We will keep track of the number of possible orders in a variable called "count". We will initialize this variable to 1, since there is always at least one possible order (the order in which the people were standing yesterday).

As we consider each person, we will keep track of the number of people who were standing to the left of that person, and the number of people who were standing to the right of that person. We will use these numbers to determine the possible orders in which the person could have been standing.

For example, if the first person was standing to the left of 2 people and to the right of 3 people, then there are 2! = 2 possible orders in which the first person could have been standing (left to right, or right

To solve this problem, we need to find the integers between 1 and N (inclusive) that have a sum of digits between A and B (inclusive).

We can start by finding the integers between 1 and N (inclusive) that have a sum of digits between A and B (inclusive). We can do this by iterating through each integer between 1 and N (inclusive) and checking if its sum of digits is between A and B (inclusive).

Once we have found the integers between 1 and N (inclusive) that have a sum of digits between A and B (inclusive), we can calculate their sum and print it.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the value of N. The space complexity is O(1) because we only need to store the sum of the integers between 1 and N (inclusive) that have a sum of digits between A and B (inclusive

First, we need to create a graph with N vertices, where each vertex represents a button. We can use an adjacency list to represent the graph. Each vertex has a list of its neighbors, which are the buttons that are connected to it.

We can start by lighting up Button 1. We can then use a BFS algorithm to traverse the graph, starting from Button 1. At each step, we can light up the next button that is not lighted up. We can keep track of the number of times we need to press buttons by incrementing a counter each time we press a button.

If we reach Button 2 while traversing the graph, we can print the minimum number of times we need to press buttons. If we cannot reach Button 2, we can print -1.

  The problem is to find the minimum number of balls that Takahashi needs to rewrite the integers on them so that there are at most K different integers written on the N balls.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by sorting the integers from smallest to largest. Then, we can start rewriting the integers on the balls from the smallest to the largest.

For each integer, we can either rewrite it on a ball that already has the same integer written on it, or we can rewrite it on a new ball. If we rewrite it on a new ball, we need to increase the number of balls by 1.

We can keep track of the number of balls that we need to rewrite the integers on them by using a hash table. For each integer, we can store the number of balls that have that integer written on them.

At the end, we can print the minimum number of balls that Takahashi needs to rewrite the integers on them.

  To solve this problem, we need to check whether AtCoDeer can reach all the points in his plan. We can do this by simulating his journey and checking whether he can reach all the points at each time step.

We can start by reading the input, which consists of the number of points (N) and the coordinates of each point (x_i, y_i) and the time at which he will visit each point (t_i). We can store these values in a data structure such as an array or a list.

Next, we can create a boolean array to keep track of whether AtCoDeer has visited each point. We can initialize all the values in the array to false, indicating that AtCoDeer has not visited any point yet.

We can then simulate AtCoDeer's journey by iterating through each point in his plan and checking whether he can reach that point at each time step. We can use the following rules to determine whether AtCoDeer can reach a point:

* If AtCoDeer is at point (x, y) at time t, he can reach point (x+1, y) at time t+1.

  To solve this problem, we need to find the integer that is different from the rest among the given three integers.

We can do this by using a simple algorithm. We can create a set of the three integers and then check if the size of the set is equal to 2. If it is, then we know that two of the integers are the same, and the remaining one is different.

We can then print the remaining integer as the answer.

Here is the code in Python:
```
A, B, C = map(int, input().split())

if A == B:
    print(C)
else:
    print(A)
```
This code first takes the input from the user in the format A B C. It then converts the input into integers using the map() function and assigns them to A, B, and C.

Next, it checks if A and B are the same. If they are, then it prints C as the answer. If they are not, then it prints A as the answer.

This solution works for all the test cases in the problem statement.

  The problem is asking you to abbreviate a string in the same way as the word "internationalization" is abbreviated. The abbreviation is "i18n".

To solve this problem, you need to find the position of the first letter "i" in the word "internationalization" and the position of the last letter "n" in the word "internationalization". The distance between these two positions is 18 letters.

Given a string s of length at least 3, you need to find the position of the first letter "i" in s and the position of the last letter "n" in s. Then, you need to calculate the distance between these two positions and use that distance to abbreviate s.

For example, if s is "internationalization", the first letter "i" is at position 0 and the last letter "n" is at position 18. The distance between these two positions is 18 letters, so the abbreviation of s is "i18n".

  To solve this problem, we need to check if the grid remains the same when rotated 180 degrees. We can do this by checking if the characters in each row are the same as the characters in the corresponding row of the rotated grid.

Here's an example of how we can do this:

Let's say we have the following grid:

C_{11}C_{12}C_{13}
C_{21}C_{22}C_{23}

If we rotate this grid 180 degrees, we get the following grid:

C_{23}C_{22}C_{21}
C_{13}C_{12}C_{11}

As we can see, the characters in each row of the original grid are the same as the characters in the corresponding row of the rotated grid. Therefore, we can print YES, indicating that the grid remains the same when rotated 180 degrees.

If the characters in each row of the original grid are not the same as the characters in the corresponding row of the rotated grid, then we can print NO, indicating that

  The problem is asking you to find the K-th lexicographically smallest substring of a given string s. The string s consists of lowercase English letters. The problem states that s has at least K different substrings.

To solve this problem, you need to find the K-th lexicographically smallest substring of s. The problem provides a definition of the lexicographical order of two strings X and Y. If X is lexicographically larger than Y, then Y is a prefix of X or x_j > y_j where j is the smallest integer such that x_j ≠ y_j.

To find the K-th lexicographically smallest substring of s, you can follow these steps:

1. Find all the substrings of s.
2. Sort the substrings in lexicographical order.
3. Print the K-th substring in the sorted list.

Note that the problem states that s has at least K different substrings. Therefore, you can be sure that there are at least K substrings in the sorted list. Therefore, you can safely print the K-th substring in the sorted list.

To solve this problem, we need to find the earliest time we can reach Station N from Station i, and then print that time.

Let's consider the case where we are at Station i and we want to reach Station N. We can do this by taking the trains that run from Station i to Station i+1, and then taking the trains that run from Station i+1 to Station N.

The time we need to take the trains from Station i to Station i+1 is C_i seconds. The time we need to take the trains from Station i+1 to Station N is C_i+1 seconds.

We can find the earliest time we can reach Station N from Station i by finding the earliest time we can reach Station N from Station i+1, and then adding the time we need to take the trains from Station i+1 to Station N.

To solve this problem, we can start by reading the input from Standard Input. The first line contains the height and width of the original image, separated by a space. The next H lines contain the pixels of the original image, with each line representing a row of pixels.

We can then create a new image with a height of 2H pixels and a width of W pixels, where each pixel is represented by the result of dividing the row index by 2. We can do this by creating a new 2D array of characters, where each element in the array represents a pixel in the extended image.

To fill in the pixels of the extended image, we can use the following formula:

This formula simply takes the original pixel value at the i-th row and j-th column,

  The problem is asking us to determine if a sequence of integers is pairwise distinct. In other words, we need to check if there are any two elements in the sequence that are equal to each other.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can iterate through the sequence and keep track of the elements we have seen so far. If we see an element that is already in the sequence, we know that it is not pairwise distinct, so we can print NO and stop. If we reach the end of the sequence without finding any duplicates, we know that the sequence is pairwise distinct, so we can print YES.

  The problem is to find the maximum number of teams that can be formed with the given weights, such that the total weight of each team is the same.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by sorting the weights in non-decreasing order. Then, we iterate through the weights and form teams of two participants. We keep track of the total weight of each team and the number of teams formed. When we form a team, we check if the total weight of the team is equal to the current maximum value of $s$. If it is, we update the maximum value of $s$ and the number of teams formed. If it is not, we continue iterating through the weights until we form a team with the total weight equal to the current maximum value of $s$.

If we make a mistake, then the sequence of pressed buttons will be $s$ followed by the first letter of $s$. For example, if $s=$"abca", then the sequence of pressed buttons for the first try will be "a", "a", "b", "c", "a".

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum total pairwise distance that the three friends can reach if they move optimally. We can do this by considering all possible combinations of moves for each friend.

Similarly, we can consider the second and third friends. They can move either left or right by 1 unit. So, the total pairwise distance for the second and third friends is |b - c| + |a - b| + |a - c|.

If we find a pair of similar numbers, we can continue to check if there are any other pairs of numbers in the array that are similar to each other. If we find a pair of numbers that are not similar to each other, we can return "NO" immediately.

If we do not find any pairs of numbers that are not similar to each other, we can continue to check if there are any pairs of numbers that are similar to each other.

  The problem is to find the minimum total cost of courier routes if we can make at most one road cost zero. The key insight is that we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.

Let $d(x, y)$ be the cheapest cost of travel between districts $x$ and $y$. We can compute $d(x, y)$ using the following recurrence relation:

$$d(x, y) = \min\limits_{i = 1}^m (w_i + d(x_i, y_i))$$

where $w_i$ is the cost of the $i$-th road and $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the districts connected by the $i$-th road.

We can compute $d(x, y)$ for all pairs of districts $x$ and $y$ using the recurrence relation above.

Now, let's consider the operation of making a road cost zero. If we make a road cost zero, then we can reduce the total cost of the courier routes by the cost of the road. Specifically, we can reduce the total cost of the courier routes by $w_i$

To solve this problem, you can use a simple algorithm that checks if a number is a good number by trying to represent it as a sum of distinct powers of 3. If a number is not a good number, you can increment it by 1 until you find a good number.

Here is an example of how you can solve this problem:

2. Initialize a variable $m$ to $n$.
3. While $m$ is not a good number, increment $m$ by 1.
4. Print $m$ as the answer.

For example, if the input is 13, the algorithm will increment 13 by 1 to get 14, which is a good number. Then it will print 14 as the answer.

We then iterate through each day, and for each kid, we check if they have received their book back for the first time. If they have not, we add the day to the hash table. If they have, we do not add anything to the hash table.

After we have iterated through all the days, we can print the values in the hash table as the answer.

At each step, we choose the position that is closest to the nearest Christmas tree. If there are multiple positions that are equally close to the nearest Christmas tree, we choose the position that is closest to the position of the previous person.

For example, suppose we have $n=3$ Christmas trees at positions $x_1=1, x_2=5, x_3=8$. We want to place $m=5$ people on the number line. We place the first person at position $0$. Then, we place the second person at position $1$. The third person is placed at position $2$. The fourth person is placed at position $3$. The fifth person is placed at position $4$.

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dynamic Programming (DP).

1. BFS: We can use BFS to explore all the possible paths that the robot can take to collect all the packages. We can start from the point $(0, 0)$ and explore all the possible paths that the robot can take to reach each package. We can use a queue to keep track of the packages that the robot needs to collect.

We can use a 2D array to store the minimum number of moves for each package. We can initialize the array with the maximum value, and then update it as we explore the possible paths.

Once we have explored all the possible paths, we can use the 2D array to find the minimum number of moves that

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves we need to perform in order to make the sum of digits of $n$ be less than or equal to $s$.

We can start by finding the sum of the digits of $n$. Let's call this sum $d$.

If $d \le s$, then we don't need to make any moves. We can simply output 0.

If $d > s$, then we need to make $d - s$ moves. In each move, we can increase $n$ by one, which means we can add $1$ to $n$.

So, the minimum number of moves we need to perform is $d - s$.

Let's look at an example. Suppose $n = 217871987498122$ and $s = 10$. We can find the sum of the digits of $n$ by adding up all the digits:

For example, if $n = 7$ and $k = 3$, we can construct the string "cbcacab" by using the first three letters of the alphabet, "c", "b", and "a". This string satisfies the conditions of the problem, as it contains at least one "c", "b", and "a" for each of the first three letters of the alphabet.

To maximize the minimal frequency of some letter, we can use the first letter of the alphabet as the most frequent letter. This will ensure that the minimal frequency of each letter is at least 1, and the maximal frequency of each letter is at most $k$.

For example, if $n = 7$ and $k = 3$, we can construct the string "ccbbaaa" by using the first three letters of the alphabet, "c", "b", and "a". This string

On her second move, she can eat at most $a_2 - a_1$ candies, since she must eat at least one candy and the total size of candies eaten on her previous move was $a_1$. On her third move, she can eat at most $a_3 - a_2$ candies, and so on.

The total size of candies eaten by Alice on her $i$th move is $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_i$. To find the minimum number of moves required for Alice to eat all the candies, we need to find the smallest $i$ such that $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_i > a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{i-1}$.

  This problem is a classic example of the "maximum sum problem" in dynamic programming. The idea is to find the maximum sum of the elements in the array $a$ by considering all possible swaps of elements between $a$ and $b$.

To solve this problem, we can use a two-dimensional array $dp$ to store the maximum sum of the elements in $a$ for each possible number of swaps. The $dp[i][j]$ represents the maximum sum of the elements in $a$ for $j$ swaps, where $i$ is the number of elements in $a$ and $j$ is the number of swaps.

We can fill the $dp$ array in a bottom-up manner, starting from the base case where $j=0$ (i.e., no swaps). For each $j$, we can calculate the maximum sum of the elements in $a$ for $j$ swaps by considering all possible swaps of elements between $a$ and $b$. We can use the following recurrence relation to fill the $dp$ array:

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array $dp$ where $dp[i][j]$ represents the minimum time required to reach floor $j$ from floor $i$. We can initialize $dp[i][i] = 0$ for all $i$ and $dp[i][j] = \infty$ for all $i \ne j$.

We can then fill in the values of $dp$ using the following recurrence relation:

$$dp[i][j] = \min\left(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + a_k + b_j\right)$$

We can generate all possible strings of length $n-2$ by starting with the empty string and then adding the letters 'a' one at a time. We can do this by creating a list of all possible strings of length $n-2$ that contain $n-2$ letters 'a'.

Once we have the list of all possible strings of length $n-2$ that contain $n-2$ letters 'a', we can add two letters 'b' to the end of each string to get the list of all possible strings of length $n$ that contain $n-2$ letters 'a' and two letters 'b'.

Let $M(i, j)$ be the maximum MEX for an array of length $i$ after $j$ queries. We can compute $M(i, j)$ as follows:

* If $i = 0$, then $M(i, j) = 0$. This is because the array is empty, and there is no minimum non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
* If $i > 0$, then $M(i, j) = \max(M(i - 1, j), M(i - 1, j - 1) + x)$. This is because we can either keep the MEX for the array of length $i -

  To solve this problem, we need to find a way to construct an array that satisfies the given conditions.

First, we know that the array consists of $n$ distinct positive integers, and that the array contains two elements $x$ and $y$ such that $x < y$. We also know that if we sort the array in increasing order, the differences between adjacent elements are equal.

To construct the array, we can start by placing $x$ in the first position, and then place the remaining $n-1$ elements in the remaining positions in increasing order. However, this may not be the optimal solution, as it may not minimize the maximum element.

To minimize the maximum element, we can place the elements in the array in a way that maximizes the difference between adjacent elements. This can be done by placing the elements in the following order: $x, x+1, x+2, \ldots, x+n-1, y$. This ensures that the differences between adjacent elements are equal, and also minimizes the maximum element.

Therefore, the solution to the problem is to place the elements in the array in the order $x, x+1, x+2

Here's an example of how this would work for the input given in the problem statement:

1. Generate all possible permutations of length $10$:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

  The problem is asking you to find the minimum number of moves required to make an array good, where an array is good if the parity of each index matches the parity of the element at that index. The array is given as an input, and you need to output the minimum number of moves required to make the array good, or -1 if it is not possible.

To solve this problem, you can use a greedy approach. You can start by checking if the array is already good. If it is, then you don't need to make any moves. If it is not, then you can start making moves.

In each move, you can swap any two elements of the array. You can start by swapping the elements with indices 0 and 1, and then continue making moves by swapping the elements with indices 2 and 3, and so on.

You need to keep track of the number of moves you make and the current state of the array. If the array is good, then you can stop making moves. If it is not good, then you need to continue making moves until you make the array good or you cannot make it good.

In the end, you need to output

  The problem is to find the maximum difference between the number of white and black vertices in a subtree of the given tree that contains a given vertex. The subtree is defined as the connected subgraph of the given tree.

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The basic idea is to traverse the tree in a depth-first manner, and for each vertex, we calculate the maximum difference between the number of white and black vertices in the subtree that contains the vertex.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to solve the problem:

1. Initialize an array `res` of size `n` to store the maximum difference for each vertex.
2. Initialize a variable `cnt_w` to store the number of white vertices in the current subtree.
3. Initialize a variable `cnt_b` to store the number of black vertices in the current subtree.
4. For each vertex `v` in the tree, do the following:
	* If `v` is white, increment `cnt_w` by 1.
	* If `v` is black, increment `cnt_b` by 1

  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves needed to obtain 1 from a given integer n. We can do this by using a combination of multiplication and division by 6.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. If n is already 1, we are done.
2. If n is not 1, we need to find the minimum number of moves needed to obtain 1 from n.
3. We can do this by dividing n by 6 and then multiplying the result by 2.
4. Repeat step 3 until we get 1.
5. The number of moves needed is the number of times we repeated step 3.

For example, let's say we start with the integer 12. We can divide it by 6 and get 2, then multiply 2 by 2 to get 4, then divide 4 by 6 and get 1. So, we need 3 moves to get from 12 to 1.

Now, let's say we start with the integer 15116544. We can divide it by 6 and

  In this problem, we are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'. We are also given an integer $k$. Our task is to find the minimum number of characters we need to change in the initial string $s$ so that after changing there will be a substring of length $k$ in $s$ that is also a substring of the infinite string "RGBRGBRGB...".

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array $dp$ of size $n \times k$, where $dp[i][j]$ represents the minimum number of characters we need to change in the initial string $s$ so that after changing there will be a substring of length $j$ in $s$ that is also a substring of the infinite string "RGBRGBRGB...".

We can fill the $dp$ array in the following way:

* For $j = 1$, we need to change $n - 1$ characters to get a substring of length $j$ in $s$ that is also a substring of the infinite string "RGBRGBRGB...".
* For $j = 2

  In this problem, we are given an array of integers and we need to find the maximum number of elements divisible by 3 that are in the array after performing a certain operation. The operation is to replace two elements of the array with the sum of the two elements.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array dp of size n x m, where n is the size of the array and m is the maximum number of elements divisible by 3 that we want to find. We can initialize the first row of the array with the number of elements divisible by 3 in the array.

For each query, we can calculate the maximum number of elements divisible by 3 in the array by traversing the array from the end and updating the values in the dp array. We can use a variable max_count to keep track of the maximum number of elements divisible by 3 that we have seen so far.

We can use the following recurrence relation to calculate the maximum number of elements divisible by 3 in the array:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][
