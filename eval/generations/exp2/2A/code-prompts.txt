You are given an unweighted tree with $n$ vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.

Your task is to choose three distinct vertices $a, b, c$ on this tree such that the number of edges which belong to at least one of the simple paths between $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $c$, or $a$ and $c$ is the maximum possible. See the notes section for a better understanding.

The simple path is the path that visits each vertex at most once.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n$ ($3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of vertices in the tree. 

Next $n - 1$ lines describe the edges of the tree in form $a_i, b_i$ ($1 \le a_i$, $b_i \le n$, $a_i \ne b_i$). It is guaranteed that given graph is a tree.


-----Output-----

In the first line print one integer $res$ — the maximum number of edges which belong to at least one of the simple paths between $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $c$, or $a$ and $c$.

In the second line print three integers $a, b, c$ such that $1 \le a, b, c \le n$ and $a \ne, b \ne c, a \ne c$.

If there are several answers, you can print any.

-----Note-----

The picture corresponding to the first example (and another one correct answer):

[Image]

If you choose vertices $1, 5, 6$ then the path between $1$ and $5$ consists of edges $(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)$, the path between $1$ and $6$ consists of edges $(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 6)$ and the path between $5$ and $6$ consists of edges $(4, 5), (4, 6)$. The union of these paths is $(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)$ so the answer is $5$. It can be shown that there is no better answer.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find three distinct vertices $a, b, c$ on a tree such that the number of edges which belong to at least one of the simple paths between $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $c$, or $a$ and $c$ is the maximum possible.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D array $dp[i][j]$ where $i$ represents the number of vertices and $j$ represents the number of edges. The $dp[i][j]$ represents the maximum number of edges which belong to at least one of the simple paths between $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $c$, or $a$ and $c$ for a tree with $i$ vertices and $j$ edges.

We can initialize the $dp[i][0]$ for all $i$ as 0, since there is no path between any two vertices in a tree with 0 edges.

We can then iterate through each edge in the tree and update the $dp[i][j]$ for each $i$ and $j$. For each edge $(u, v)$, we can update the $

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
Recently you have received two positive integer numbers $x$ and $y$. You forgot them, but you remembered a shuffled list containing all divisors of $x$ (including $1$ and $x$) and all divisors of $y$ (including $1$ and $y$). If $d$ is a divisor of both numbers $x$ and $y$ at the same time, there are two occurrences of $d$ in the list.

For example, if $x=4$ and $y=6$ then the given list can be any permutation of the list $[1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 6]$. Some of the possible lists are: $[1, 1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 2]$, $[4, 6, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2]$ or $[1, 6, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2]$.

Your problem is to restore suitable positive integer numbers $x$ and $y$ that would yield the same list of divisors (possibly in different order).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists, i.e. the given list of divisors corresponds to some positive integers $x$ and $y$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 128$) — the number of divisors of $x$ and $y$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$ ($1 \le d_i \le 10^4$), where $d_i$ is either divisor of $x$ or divisor of $y$. If a number is divisor of both numbers $x$ and $y$ then there are two copies of this number in the list.


-----Output-----

Print two positive integer numbers $x$ and $y$ — such numbers that merged list of their divisors is the permutation of the given list of integers. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Example-----
Input

10 2 8 1 2 4 1 20 4 5

Output
20 8

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find two positive integers $x$ and $y$ such that the list of their divisors is the same as the given list of integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. Create a dictionary where the keys are the divisors of $x$ and $y$, and the values are the number of times each divisor appears in the given list.
2. Initialize two variables $x$ and $y$ to 1.
3. For each divisor $d$ in the given list, if $d$ is a divisor of $x$, then increment $x$ by $d$. If $d$ is a divisor of $y$, then increment $y$ by $d$.
4. If the dictionary contains any divisors that are not divisors of $x$ or $y$, then return an error.
5. Return the values of $x$ and $y$.

Here is an example of how this approach would work for the given input:

You are given a matrix $a$ of size $n \times m$ consisting of integers.

You can choose no more than $\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor$ elements in each row. Your task is to choose these elements in such a way that their sum is divisible by $k$ and this sum is the maximum.

In other words, you can choose no more than a half (rounded down) of elements in each row, you have to find the maximum sum of these elements divisible by $k$.

Note that you can choose zero elements (and the sum of such set is $0$).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, m, k \le 70$) — the number of rows in the matrix, the number of columns in the matrix and the value of $k$. The next $n$ lines contain $m$ elements each, where the $j$-th element of the $i$-th row is $a_{i, j}$ ($1 \le a_{i, j} \le 70$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the maximum sum divisible by $k$ you can obtain.

-----Note-----

In the first example, the optimal answer is $2$ and $4$ in the first row, $5$ and $2$ in the second row and $7$ and $4$ in the third row. The total sum is $2 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 7 + 4 = 24$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum sum of elements in a matrix that is divisible by a given value $k$. The constraint is that each row can have at most half of the elements chosen, and the sum of the chosen elements must be divisible by $k$.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a two-dimensional array $dp$ of size $n \times m$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the matrix and $m$ is the number of columns. The $i$-th row and $j$-th column of $dp$ will store the maximum sum of elements in the submatrix from the $i$-th row to the last row and from the $j$-th column to the last column that is divisible by $k$.

We can initialize the first row and first column of $dp$ with the value of the first element in the matrix. We can then fill in the rest of the array using the following recurrence relation:

$$dp[i][j] = \max\left(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + a[i][j]\right)$$

The only difference between problems C1 and C2 is that all values in input of problem C1 are distinct (this condition may be false for problem C2).

You are given a sequence $a$ consisting of $n$ integers.

You are making a sequence of moves. During each move you must take either the leftmost element of the sequence or the rightmost element of the sequence, write it down and remove it from the sequence. Your task is to write down a strictly increasing sequence, and among all such sequences you should take the longest (the length of the sequence is the number of elements in it).

For example, for the sequence $[1, 2, 4, 3, 2]$ the answer is $4$ (you take $1$ and the sequence becomes $[2, 4, 3, 2]$, then you take the rightmost element $2$ and the sequence becomes $[2, 4, 3]$, then you take $3$ and the sequence becomes $[2, 4]$ and then you take $4$ and the sequence becomes $[2]$, the obtained increasing sequence is $[1, 2, 3, 4]$).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in $a$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.


-----Output-----

In the first line of the output print $k$ — the maximum number of elements in a strictly increasing sequence you can obtain.

In the second line print a string $s$ of length $k$, where the $j$-th character of this string $s_j$ should be 'L' if you take the leftmost element during the $j$-th move and 'R' otherwise. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

The first example is described in the problem statement.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the longest strictly increasing subsequence of a given sequence. A strictly increasing subsequence is a subsequence in which each element is greater than the previous element.

To solve this problem, you can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to create a table where the $i$th row represents the maximum length of a strictly increasing subsequence that ends at the $i$th element of the input sequence. The table should be initialized with the length of the first element of the input sequence.

Then, for each element $j$ in the input sequence, you can calculate the maximum length of a strictly increasing subsequence that ends at $j$ by considering the maximum length of a strictly increasing subsequence that ends at $j-1$ and the length of the subsequence that ends at $j$. The maximum length of a strictly increasing subsequence that ends at $j$ is the maximum of these two values.

Finally, you can print the maximum length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in the last row of the table.

Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:

You are given a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ consisting of $n$ integers.

You can choose any non-negative integer $D$ (i.e. $D \ge 0$), and for each $a_i$ you can:

  add $D$ (only once), i. e. perform $a_i := a_i + D$, or  subtract $D$ (only once), i. e. perform $a_i := a_i - D$, or  leave the value of $a_i$ unchanged. 

It is possible that after an operation the value $a_i$ becomes negative.

Your goal is to choose such minimum non-negative integer $D$ and perform changes in such a way, that all $a_i$ are equal (i.e. $a_1=a_2=\dots=a_n$).

Print the required $D$ or, if it is impossible to choose such value $D$, print -1.

For example, for array $[2, 8]$ the value $D=3$ is minimum possible because you can obtain the array $[5, 5]$ if you will add $D$ to $2$ and subtract $D$ from $8$. And for array $[1, 4, 7, 7]$ the value $D=3$ is also minimum possible. You can add it to $1$ and subtract it from $7$ and obtain the array $[4, 4, 4, 4]$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in $a$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the sequence $a$.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum non-negative integer value $D$ such that if you add this value to some $a_i$, subtract this value from some $a_i$ and leave some $a_i$ without changes, all obtained values become equal.

If it is impossible to choose such value $D$, print -1.

The problem is to find the minimum non-negative integer $D$ such that after adding $D$ to some $a_i$, subtracting $D$ from some $a_i$, and leaving some $a_i$ unchanged, all $a_i$ become equal.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by adding $D$ to the first element of the array, then subtracting $D$ from the last element of the array, and then leaving the middle elements unchanged.

We can repeat this process until all elements of the array are equal. If we are unable to make all elements equal, we print -1.

For example, if the input array is $[1, 4, 4, 7, 4, 1]$, we can start by adding $D=3$ to the first element, which gives us $[4, 4, 4, 7, 4, 1]$. Then, we subtract $D=3$ from the last element, which gives us $[4, 4, 4, 7, 1, 1]$. Finally, we leave the middle elements unchanged, which

There is a white sheet of paper lying on a rectangle table. The sheet is a rectangle with its sides parallel to the sides of the table. If you will take a look from above and assume that the bottom left corner of the table has coordinates $(0, 0)$, and coordinate axes are left and bottom sides of the table, then the bottom left corner of the white sheet has coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$, and the top right — $(x_2, y_2)$.

After that two black sheets of paper are placed on the table. Sides of both black sheets are also parallel to the sides of the table. Coordinates of the bottom left corner of the first black sheet are $(x_3, y_3)$, and the top right — $(x_4, y_4)$. Coordinates of the bottom left corner of the second black sheet are $(x_5, y_5)$, and the top right — $(x_6, y_6)$.  [Image] Example of three rectangles. 

Determine if some part of the white sheet can be seen from the above after the two black sheets are placed. The part of the white sheet can be seen if there is at least one point lying not strictly inside the white sheet and strictly outside of both black sheets.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains four integers $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$ $(0 \le x_1 < x_2 \le 10^{6}, 0 \le y_1 < y_2 \le 10^{6})$ — coordinates of the bottom left and the top right corners of the white sheet.

The second line of the input contains four integers $x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4$ $(0 \le x_3 < x_4 \le 10^{6}, 0 \le y_3 < y_4 \le 10^{6})$ — coordinates of the bottom left and the top right corners of the first black sheet.

The third line of the input contains four integers $x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6$ $(0 \le x_5 < x_6 \le 10^{6}, 0 \le y_5 < y_6 \le 10^{6})$ — coordinates of the bottom left and the top right corners of the second black sheet.

The sides of each sheet of paper are parallel (perpendicular) to the coordinate axes.

In the first example the white sheet is fully covered by black sheets.

The problem is to determine if some part of the white sheet can be seen from the above after the two black sheets are placed. The part of the white sheet can be seen if there is at least one point lying not strictly inside the white sheet and strictly outside of both black sheets.

To solve this problem, we need to find the intersection of the white sheet and the two black sheets. We can do this by finding the points where the edges of the white sheet and the black sheets intersect.

We can start by finding the edges of the white sheet. The bottom edge of the white sheet is the line segment from $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(x_2, y_2)$. The top edge is the line segment from $(x_2, y_2)$ to $(x_1, y_1)$. The left edge is the line segment from $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(x_1, y_2)$. And the right edge is the line segment from $(x_2, y_2)$ to $(x_2, y_1)$.

Let's denote a function $f(x)$ in such a way: we add $1$ to $x$, then, while there is at least one trailing zero in the resulting number, we remove that zero. For example,   $f(599) = 6$: $599 + 1 = 600 \rightarrow 60 \rightarrow 6$;  $f(7) = 8$: $7 + 1 = 8$;  $f(9) = 1$: $9 + 1 = 10 \rightarrow 1$;  $f(10099) = 101$: $10099 + 1 = 10100 \rightarrow 1010 \rightarrow 101$. 

We say that some number $y$ is reachable from $x$ if we can apply function $f$ to $x$ some (possibly zero) times so that we get $y$ as a result. For example, $102$ is reachable from $10098$ because $f(f(f(10098))) = f(f(10099)) = f(101) = 102$; and any number is reachable from itself.

The problem is to find the correct values for the friends' gifts, given that each friend wants to give exactly one gift and receive exactly one gift, and there is no friend who gives the gift to himself.

The solution is to assign the gifts in a way that each friend receives a gift from a different friend, and each friend gives a gift to a different friend.

To do this, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by assigning the gifts to the friends in the order they were given in the input. If a friend wants to give a gift to a specific friend, we assign the gift to that friend. If a friend wants to give a gift to anyone, we assign the gift to the next available friend.

For example, suppose we have the following input:

To solve this problem, we need to find a way to color the array $a$ in $k$ colors such that each element is colored in some color, there is at least one element colored in each color, and all elements colored in the same color are distinct.

One way to do this is to use a greedy algorithm. We can start by coloring the first element of the array $a$ with color $1$. Then, we can color the second element of the array $a$ with color $2$ if it is not already colored with color $1$. We can continue this process until we have colored all $n$ elements of the array $a$.

After we have colored all $n$ elements of the array $a$, we can check if the coloring is valid. If it is not valid, we can print "NO" and stop. Otherwise, we can print "YES" and any valid coloring of the array $a$.

For example, if the array $a$ is [1, 2, 2, 3], we can color it as follows:

1. Color the first element of the array $a$ with color $1$.

You are given a huge decimal number consisting of $n$ digits. It is guaranteed that this number has no leading zeros. Each digit of this number is either 0 or 1.

You may perform several (possibly zero) operations with this number. During each operation you are allowed to change any digit of your number; you may change 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. It is possible that after some operation you can obtain a number with leading zeroes, but it does not matter for this problem.

You are also given two integers $0 \le y < x < n$. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations you should perform to obtain the number that has remainder $10^y$ modulo $10^x$. In other words, the obtained number should have remainder $10^y$ when divided by $10^x$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n, x, y$ ($0 \le y < x < n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of the number and the integers $x$ and $y$, respectively.

The second line of the input contains one decimal number consisting of $n$ digits, each digit of this number is either 0 or 1. It is guaranteed that the first digit of the number is 1.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum number of operations you should perform to obtain the number having remainder $10^y$ modulo $10^x$. In other words, the obtained number should have remainder $10^y$ when divided by $10^x$.

-----Note-----

In the first example the number will be $11010100100$ after performing one operation. It has remainder $100$ modulo $100000$.

In the second example the number will be $11010100010$ after performing three operations. It has remainder $10$ modulo $100000$.

-----Plan-----
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can break down the problem into smaller sub-problems, where each sub-problem involves finding the minimum number of operations to obtain a number with a specific remainder modulo $10^x$.

Let $dp[i][j]$ be the minimum number of operations to obtain a number with remainder $j$ modulo $10^x$ when the number has $i$ digits. We can initialize $dp[0][j] = 0$ for all $j$ and $dp[i][0] = 1$ for all $i$.

For each $i$ and $j$, we can calculate $dp[i][j]$ as follows:

* If the $i$th digit of the number is 0, we can change it to 1 and obtain a number with remainder $j$ modulo $10^x$. The number of operations required to obtain this number is $dp[i-1][j]$.
* If the $i$th digit of the number is 1, we can change it to 0 and obtain a number with remainder $j-10^x$ modulo $10^

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers.

Your task is to determine if $a$ has some subsequence of length at least $3$ that is a palindrome.

Recall that an array $b$ is called a subsequence of the array $a$ if $b$ can be obtained by removing some (possibly, zero) elements from $a$ (not necessarily consecutive) without changing the order of remaining elements. For example, $[2]$, $[1, 2, 1, 3]$ and $[2, 3]$ are subsequences of $[1, 2, 1, 3]$, but $[1, 1, 2]$ and $[4]$ are not.

Also, recall that a palindrome is an array that reads the same backward as forward. In other words, the array $a$ of length $n$ is the palindrome if $a_i = a_{n - i - 1}$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $n$. For example, arrays $[1234]$, $[1, 2, 1]$, $[1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1]$ and $[10, 100, 10]$ are palindromes, but arrays $[1, 2]$ and $[1, 2, 3, 1]$ are not.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases.

Next $2t$ lines describe test cases. The first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 5000$) — the length of $a$. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5000$ ($\sum n \le 5000$).


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer — "YES" (without quotes) if $a$ has some subsequence of length at least $3$ that is a palindrome and "NO" otherwise.

-----Note-----

In the first test case of the example, the array $a$ has a subsequence $[1, 2, 1]$ which is a palindrome.

In the second test case of the example, the array $a$ has two subsequences of length $3$ which are palindromes: $[2, 3, 2]$ and $[2, 2, 2]$.

In the third test case of the example, the array $a$ has no subsequences of length at least $3$ which are palindromes.

In the fourth test case of the example, the array $a$ has one subsequence of length $4$ which is a palindrome: $[1, 2, 2, 1]$ (and has two subsequences of length $3$ which are palindromes: both are $[1, 2, 1]$).

In the fifth test case of the example, the array $a$ has no subsequences of length at least $3$ which are palindromes.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to determine if an array has a subsequence of length at least 3 that is a palindrome. A palindrome is an array that reads the same backward as forward.

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We can start by iterating through the array and keeping track of the current subsequence. We can use a variable to keep track of the length of the current subsequence. If the current subsequence is a palindrome, we can return "YES".

If the current subsequence is not a palindrome, we can remove the first element of the subsequence and add the last element of the subsequence. We can then check if the new subsequence is a palindrome. If it is, we can return "YES".

If the new subsequence is not a palindrome, we can continue iterating through the array until we reach the end. If we reach the end and the current subsequence is not a palindrome, we can return "NO".

Here is an example of how this approach would work:

You are given a long decimal number $a$ consisting of $n$ digits from $1$ to $9$. You also have a function $f$ that maps every digit from $1$ to $9$ to some (possibly the same) digit from $1$ to $9$.

You can perform the following operation no more than once: choose a non-empty contiguous subsegment of digits in $a$, and replace each digit $x$ from this segment with $f(x)$. For example, if $a = 1337$, $f(1) = 1$, $f(3) = 5$, $f(7) = 3$, and you choose the segment consisting of three rightmost digits, you get $1553$ as the result.

The problem is asking you to find the maximum number that can be obtained by applying the operation described in the statement no more than once. The operation involves choosing a non-empty contiguous subsegment of digits in $a$ and replacing each digit $x$ from this segment with $f(x)$.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value that can be obtained by applying the operation to the given number $a$. We can do this by finding the maximum value that can be obtained by applying the operation to each digit of $a$ separately.

Let's consider the first digit of $a$. We can apply the operation to this digit by replacing it with $f(1)$. The maximum value that can be obtained by applying the operation to this digit is $f(1)$.

Now, let's consider the second digit of $a$. We can apply the operation to this digit by replacing it with $f(2)$. The maximum value that can be obtained by applying the operation to this digit is $f(2)$.

Similarly, let's consider the third digit of $a$. We can apply the operation to this digit by replacing it with $f(3)$. The maximum

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integer numbers.

Let instability of the array be the following value: $\max\limits_{i = 1}^{n} a_i - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{n} a_i$.

You have to remove exactly one element from this array to minimize instability of the resulting $(n-1)$-elements array. Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of elements in the array $a$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^5$) — elements of the array $a$.

-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove $7$ then instability of the remaining array will be $3 - 1 = 2$.

In the second example you can remove either $1$ or $100000$ then instability of the remaining array will be $100000 - 100000 = 0$ and $1 - 1 = 0$ correspondingly.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum possible instability of an array after removing one element. The instability is calculated as the maximum element minus the minimum element.

To solve this problem, we need to find the element with the maximum value and the element with the minimum value in the array. Then, we can calculate the instability by subtracting the maximum element from the minimum element.

To find the maximum element, we can use a linear scan of the array. We can start by setting the maximum element to the first element of the array. Then, we can compare each element in the array with the current maximum element and update the maximum element if necessary.

To find the minimum element, we can use a linear scan of the array. We can start by setting the minimum element to the first element of the array. Then, we can compare each element in the array with the current minimum element and update the minimum element if necessary.

Once we have found the maximum and minimum elements, we can calculate the instability by subtracting the maximum element from the minimum element.

The time complexity of this solution is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity is $O

Petya studies at university. The current academic year finishes with $n$ special days. Petya needs to pass $m$ exams in those special days. The special days in this problem are numbered from $1$ to $n$.

There are three values about each exam:  $s_i$ — the day, when questions for the $i$-th exam will be published,  $d_i$ — the day of the $i$-th exam ($s_i < d_i$),  $c_i$ — number of days Petya needs to prepare for the $i$-th exam. For the $i$-th exam Petya should prepare in days between $s_i$ and $d_i-1$, inclusive. 

There are three types of activities for Petya in each day: to spend a day doing nothing (taking a rest), to spend a day passing exactly one exam or to spend a day preparing for exactly one exam. So he can't pass/prepare for multiple exams in a day. He can't mix his activities in a day. If he is preparing for the $i$-th exam in day $j$, then $s_i \le j < d_i$.

It is allowed to have breaks in a preparation to an exam and to alternate preparations for different exams in consecutive days. So preparation for an exam is not required to be done in consecutive days.

Find the schedule for Petya to prepare for all exams and pass them, or report that it is impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ $(2 \le n \le 100, 1 \le m \le n)$ — the number of days and the number of exams.

Each of the following $m$ lines contains three integers $s_i$, $d_i$, $c_i$ $(1 \le s_i < d_i \le n, 1 \le c_i \le n)$ — the day, when questions for the $i$-th exam will be given, the day of the $i$-th exam, number of days Petya needs to prepare for the $i$-th exam. 

Guaranteed, that all the exams will be in different days. Questions for different exams can be given in the same day. It is possible that, in the day of some exam, the questions for other exams are given.


-----Output-----

If Petya can not prepare and pass all the exams, print -1. In case of positive answer, print $n$ integers, where the $j$-th number is:  $(m + 1)$, if the $j$-th day is a day of some exam (recall that in each day no more than one exam is conducted),  zero, if in the $j$-th day Petya will have a rest,  $i$ ($1 \le i \le m$), if Petya will prepare for the $i$-th exam in the day $j$ (the total number of days Petya prepares for each exam should be strictly equal to the number of days needed to prepare for it).

Assume that the exams are numbered in order of appearing in the input, starting from $1$.

If there are multiple schedules, print any of them.

-----Note-----

In the first example Petya can, for example, prepare for exam $1$ in the first day, prepare for exam $2$ in the second day, pass exam $1$ in the third day, relax in the fourth day, and pass exam $2$ in the fifth day. So, he can prepare and pass all exams.

In the second example, there are three days and two exams. So, Petya can prepare in only one day (because in two other days he should pass exams). Then Petya can not prepare and pass all exams.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find a schedule for Petya to prepare for all exams and pass them, or report that it is impossible. The input consists of two integers $n$ and $m$, the number of days and the number of exams, respectively, and $m$ lines containing three integers $s_i$, $d_i$, $c_i$, the day, when questions for the $i$-th exam will be given, the day of the $i$-th exam, and the number of days Petya needs to prepare for the $i$-th exam, respectively.

The output should be $n$ integers, where the $j$-th number is:

* $(m + 1)$, if the $j$-th day is a day of some exam (recall that in each day no more than one exam is conducted),
* zero, if in the $j$-th day Petya will have a rest,
* $i$, if Petya will prepare for the $i$-th exam in the day $j$ (the total number of days Petya prepares for each exam should be strictly equal to the number of days needed to prepare for it).

Polycarp plays "Game 23". Initially he has a number $n$ and his goal is to transform it to $m$. In one move, he can multiply $n$ by $2$ or multiply $n$ by $3$. He can perform any number of moves.

Print the number of moves needed to transform $n$ to $m$. Print -1 if it is impossible to do so.

It is easy to prove that any way to transform $n$ to $m$ contains the same number of moves (i.e. number of moves doesn't depend on the way of transformation).


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le m \le 5\cdot10^8$).


-----Output-----

In the first example, the possible sequence of moves is: $120 \rightarrow 240 \rightarrow 720 \rightarrow 1440 \rightarrow 4320 \rightarrow 12960 \rightarrow 25920 \rightarrow 51840.$ The are $7$ steps in total.

In the second example, no moves are needed. Thus, the answer is $0$.

In the third example, it is impossible to transform $48$ to $72$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of moves required to transform $n$ to $m$. We can do this by following a series of moves that will transform $n$ to $m$.

We can start by multiplying $n$ by $2$ to get $2n$. If $m$ is even, we can continue to multiply $2n$ by $2$ to get $4n$, and so on. If $m$ is odd, we can multiply $2n$ by $3$ to get $3n$, and then continue to multiply $3n$ by $2$ to get $6n$, and so on.

We can continue this process until we reach $m$. If we reach $m$ by multiplying $n$ by $2$ repeatedly, we will have $m$ as our final result. If we reach $m$ by multiplying $n$ by $3$ repeatedly, we will have $m$ as our final result.

The key is to find the smallest number of moves required to transform $n$ to $m$. We can do this by finding the smallest number of moves required to transform $n$ to $m$

-----Plan-----
The problem is to construct a string $s$ of minimum possible length that has exactly $k$ substrings equal to the given string $t$. The key observation is that we can construct such a string by concatenating $t$ with itself $n-1$ times, and then adding any remaining characters to the end of the string.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Construct the string $s$ by concatenating $t$ with itself $n-1$ times. This gives us a string of length $n(n-1) = n^2-n$ characters.
2. Add any remaining characters to the end of the string $s$ to make it of length $n^2-n+k$ characters. This ensures that there are exactly $k$ positions in the string $s$ where the substring $t$ appears.

For example, if $t = "aba"$ and $k = 4$, then we can construct the string $s$ as follows:

1. Construct the string $s$ by concatenating $t$ with itself $n-1 = 2$ times: $s = "abaaba

Let's call an array good if there is an element in the array that equals to the sum of all other elements. For example, the array $a=[1, 3, 3, 7]$ is good because there is the element $a_4=7$ which equals to the sum $1 + 3 + 3$.

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. Your task is to print all indices $j$ of this array such that after removing the $j$-th element from the array it will be good (let's call such indices nice).

For example, if $a=[8, 3, 5, 2]$, the nice indices are $1$ and $4$:   if you remove $a_1$, the array will look like $[3, 5, 2]$ and it is good;  if you remove $a_4$, the array will look like $[8, 3, 5]$ and it is good. 

You have to consider all removals independently, i. e. remove the element, check if the resulting array is good, and return the element into the array.

-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove any element with the value $2$ so the array will look like $[5, 1, 2, 2]$. The sum of this array is $10$ and there is an element equals to the sum of remaining elements ($5 = 1 + 2 + 2$).

In the second example you can remove $8$ so the array will look like $[3, 5, 2]$. The sum of this array is $10$ and there is an element equals to the sum of remaining elements ($5 = 3 + 2$). You can also remove $2$ so the array will look like $[8, 3, 5]$. The sum of this array is $16$ and there is an element equals to the sum of remaining elements ($8 = 3 + 5$).

In the third example you cannot make the given array good by removing exactly one element.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the indices of the array that, when removed, will make the array good.

To solve this problem, we can use a technique called "dynamic programming". We will create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of the elements in the subarray of the original array from index 0 to index j, inclusive, where the element at index i is removed.

We can fill in the dp array as follows:

* dp[i][0] = a[i]
* dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1], a[i] + dp[i-1][j]) for j > 0

The reason for this is that if we remove the element at index i, we have two options:

* We can remove the element at index i-1 and keep the rest of the elements in the subarray. In this case, the maximum sum of the elements in the subarray is dp[i-1][j-1].
* We can remove the element at index i-1 and add the element at index i to the rest

The only difference between the easy and the hard versions is constraints.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no symbols without changing the order of the remaining symbols. Characters to be deleted are not required to go successively, there can be any gaps between them. For example, for the string "abaca" the following strings are subsequences: "abaca", "aba", "aaa", "a" and "" (empty string). But the following strings are not subsequences: "aabaca", "cb" and "bcaa".

You are given a string $s$ consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters.

In one move you can take any subsequence $t$ of the given string and add it to the set $S$. The set $S$ can't contain duplicates. This move costs $n - |t|$, where $|t|$ is the length of the added subsequence (i.e. the price equals to the number of the deleted characters).

Your task is to find out the minimum possible total cost to obtain a set $S$ of size $k$ or report that it is impossible to do so.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 100, 1 \le k \le 10^{12}$) — the length of the string and the size of the set, correspondingly.

The second line of the input contains a string $s$ consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — if it is impossible to obtain the set $S$ of size $k$, print -1. Otherwise, print the minimum possible total cost to do it.

-----Note-----

In the first example we can generate $S$ = { "asdf", "asd", "adf", "asf", "sdf" }. The cost of the first element in $S$ is $0$ and the cost of the others is $1$. So the total cost of $S$ is $4$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum cost to generate a set $S$ of size $k$ from a given string $s$ of length $n$. The cost of each element in $S$ is the length of the subsequence minus the length of the original string. The constraint is that the set $S$ cannot contain duplicates.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D array $dp$ of size $n \times k$, where $dp[i][j]$ represents the minimum cost to generate a set $S$ of size $j$ from the first $i$ characters of the string $s$.

We can initialize the first row of $dp$ as follows:

* $dp[0][0] = 0$ (since we need to generate an empty set $S$ of size 0)
* $dp[0][j] = -1$ for $j > 0$ (since we cannot generate a set $S$ of size $j$ from an empty string)

We can then fill in the remaining rows of $dp$ as follows:

You are given an undirected unweighted connected graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple edges in the given graph.

Your task is to find any spanning tree of this graph such that the degree of the first vertex (vertex with label $1$ on it) is equal to $D$ (or say that there are no such spanning trees). Recall that the degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $D$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $n - 1 \le m \le min(2 \cdot 10^5, \frac{n(n-1)}{2}), 1 \le D < n$) — the number of vertices, the number of edges and required degree of the first vertex, respectively.

The following $m$ lines denote edges: edge $i$ is represented by a pair of integers $v_i$, $u_i$ ($1 \le v_i, u_i \le n$, $u_i \ne v_i$), which are the indices of vertices connected by the edge. There are no loops or multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair ($v_i, u_i$) there are no other pairs ($v_i, u_i$) or ($u_i, v_i$) in the list of edges, and for each pair $(v_i, u_i)$ the condition $v_i \ne u_i$ is satisfied.


-----Output-----

If there is no spanning tree satisfying the condition from the problem statement, print "NO" in the first line.

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line and then print $n-1$ lines describing the edges of a spanning tree such that the degree of the first vertex (vertex with label $1$ on it) is equal to $D$. Make sure that the edges of the printed spanning tree form some subset of the input edges (order doesn't matter and edge $(v, u)$ is considered the same as the edge $(u, v)$).

If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find a spanning tree of a connected undirected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges such that the degree of the first vertex (vertex with label $1$ on it) is equal to $D$.

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The basic idea of the algorithm is to start from the first vertex and explore the graph depth-first, i.e., we visit a vertex and all its neighbors before moving on to the next vertex.

Here's a step-by-step description of how the algorithm works:

1. Initialize a stack to store the vertices of the graph.
2. Initialize a set to store the visited vertices.
3. Initialize a set to store the edges of the spanning tree.
4. While the stack is not empty, pop a vertex from the stack and visit all its neighbors that have not been visited yet.
5. If the degree of the current vertex is equal to $D$, we have found a spanning tree.
6. If the degree of the current vertex is not equal to $D$, we add all its neighbors to the stack and

Polycarp is going to participate in the contest. It starts at $h_1:m_1$ and ends at $h_2:m_2$. It is guaranteed that the contest lasts an even number of minutes (i.e. $m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2$, where $x \% y$ is $x$ modulo $y$). It is also guaranteed that the entire contest is held during a single day. And finally it is guaranteed that the contest lasts at least two minutes.

Polycarp wants to know the time of the midpoint of the contest. For example, if the contest lasts from $10:00$ to $11:00$ then the answer is $10:30$, if the contest lasts from $11:10$ to $11:12$ then the answer is $11:11$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $h_1$ and $m_1$ in the format hh:mm.

The second line of the input contains two integers $h_2$ and $m_2$ in the same format (hh:mm).

It is guaranteed that $0 \le h_1, h_2 \le 23$ and $0 \le m_1, m_2 \le 59$.

It is guaranteed that the contest lasts an even number of minutes (i.e. $m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2$, where $x \% y$ is $x$ modulo $y$). It is also guaranteed that the entire contest is held during a single day. And finally it is guaranteed that the contest lasts at least two minutes.


-----Output-----

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the midpoint of the time interval between $h_1:m_1$ and $h_2:m_2$. Since the contest lasts an even number of minutes, we can assume that the time interval is even.

Let's denote the midpoint of the time interval as $h_3:m_3$. We can write the time interval as $t_1 = h_1:m_1$ and $t_2 = h_2:m_2$.

We know that the time interval is even, so we can write $t_1 + t_2 = 2k$ for some integer $k$. We also know that the time interval lasts at least two minutes, so we can write $m_1 + m_2 \ge 2$.

We can use these constraints to find the solution. Let's first find the value of $k$. We know that $t_1 + t_2 = 2k$, so we can write $h_1 + h_2 = 2k$. Since the time interval lasts at least two minutes, we can write $m_1 + m

The problem is to find the smallest integer greater than or equal to the input integer.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that involves checking each integer from the input integer to the largest integer that is less than or equal to the input integer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Start with the input integer.
2. Check if the input integer is greater than or equal to 1. If it is, then the answer is 1.
3. If the input integer is less than 1, then we need to find the smallest integer greater than or equal to 1. We can do this by starting with 1 and incrementing by 1 until we find the first integer that is greater than or equal to the input integer.
4. Once we find the first integer that is greater than or equal to the input integer, we can output that integer.

For example, if the input is 27, we would start with 27 and check if it is greater than or equal to 1. Since it is, we would output 1. Then, we would check if 27 is less than 1. Since

You are given $n$ segments on a number line; each endpoint of every segment has integer coordinates. Some segments can degenerate to points. Segments can intersect with each other, be nested in each other or even coincide.

The intersection of a sequence of segments is such a maximal set of points (not necesserily having integer coordinates) that each point lies within every segment from the sequence. If the resulting set isn't empty, then it always forms some continuous segment. The length of the intersection is the length of the resulting segment or $0$ in case the intersection is an empty set.

For example, the intersection of segments $[1;5]$ and $[3;10]$ is $[3;5]$ (length $2$), the intersection of segments $[1;5]$ and $[5;7]$ is $[5;5]$ (length $0$) and the intersection of segments $[1;5]$ and $[6;6]$ is an empty set (length $0$).

Your task is to remove exactly one segment from the given sequence in such a way that the intersection of the remaining $(n - 1)$ segments has the maximal possible length.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of segments in the sequence.

Each of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($0 \le l_i \le r_i \le 10^9$) — the description of the $i$-th segment.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximal possible length of the intersection of $(n - 1)$ remaining segments after you remove exactly one segment from the sequence.

-----Note-----

In the first example you should remove the segment $[3;3]$, the intersection will become $[2;3]$ (length $1$). Removing any other segment will result in the intersection $[3;3]$ (length $0$).

In the second example you should remove the segment $[1;3]$ or segment $[2;6]$, the intersection will become $[2;4]$ (length $2$) or $[1;3]$ (length $2$), respectively. Removing any other segment will result in the intersection $[2;3]$ (length $1$).

In the third example the intersection will become an empty set no matter the segment you remove.

In the fourth example you will get the intersection $[3;10]$ (length $7$) if you remove the segment $[1;5]$ or the intersection $[1;5]$ (length $4$) if you remove the segment $[3;10]$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the longest intersection of a sequence of segments, where each segment is defined by two integer coordinates. The intersection is the set of points that lie within all the segments in the sequence. The problem is to remove exactly one segment from the sequence such that the intersection of the remaining segments has the maximum possible length.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by sorting the segments in the sequence by their left endpoint. We can then iterate through the segments and remove the segment with the smallest right endpoint. We can keep track of the intersection of the remaining segments and update it as we remove segments.

At each step, we can check if the intersection of the remaining segments has the maximum possible length. If it does, we can stop and return the length of the intersection. If it doesn't, we can continue iterating through the segments until we find a segment that can be removed without reducing the length of the intersection.

The time complexity of this approach is $O(n\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of segments in the sequence. The space complexity is $O(n)$, since we need to store the sorted segments and the intersection of the remaining segments.

Vova's family is building the Great Vova Wall (named by Vova himself). Vova's parents, grandparents, grand-grandparents contributed to it. Now it's totally up to Vova to put the finishing touches.

The current state of the wall can be respresented by a sequence $a$ of $n$ integers, with $a_i$ being the height of the $i$-th part of the wall.

Vova can only use $2 \times 1$ bricks to put in the wall (he has infinite supply of them, however).

Vova can put bricks only horizontally on the neighbouring parts of the wall of equal height. It means that if for some $i$ the current height of part $i$ is the same as for part $i + 1$, then Vova can put a brick there and thus increase both heights by 1. Obviously, Vova can't put bricks in such a way that its parts turn out to be off the borders (to the left of part $1$ of the wall or to the right of part $n$ of it).

Note that Vova can't put bricks vertically.

Vova is a perfectionist, so he considers the wall completed when:  all parts of the wall has the same height;  the wall has no empty spaces inside it. 

Can Vova complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero)?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of parts in the wall.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the initial heights of the parts of the wall.

-----Note-----

In the first example Vova can put a brick on parts 2 and 3 to make the wall $[2, 2, 2, 2, 5]$ and then put 3 bricks on parts 1 and 2 and 3 bricks on parts 3 and 4 to make it $[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]$.

In the second example Vova can put no bricks in the wall.

In the third example the wall is already complete.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking if Vova can complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero). The wall is represented by a sequence of integers, where each integer represents the height of a part of the wall. Vova can only use 2x1 bricks to put in the wall, and he can only put bricks on neighboring parts of equal height. The wall is considered complete when all parts have the same height and there are no empty spaces inside the wall.

To solve this problem, we need to check if it is possible to complete the wall using any amount of bricks. We can do this by checking if it is possible to complete the wall using a specific amount of bricks. If it is possible to complete the wall using a specific amount of bricks, then it is also possible to complete the wall using any amount of bricks.

We can start by checking if it is possible to complete the wall using 0 bricks. If it is possible to complete the wall using 0 bricks, then it is also possible to complete the wall using any amount of bricks. This is because we can simply put no bricks in the wall and it will still be complete.

Masha has $n$ types of tiles of size $2 \times 2$. Each cell of the tile contains one integer. Masha has an infinite number of tiles of each type.

Masha decides to construct the square of size $m \times m$ consisting of the given tiles. This square also has to be a symmetric with respect to the main diagonal matrix, and each cell of this square has to be covered with exactly one tile cell, and also sides of tiles should be parallel to the sides of the square. All placed tiles cannot intersect with each other. Also, each tile should lie inside the square. See the picture in Notes section for better understanding.

Symmetric with respect to the main diagonal matrix is such a square $s$ that for each pair $(i, j)$ the condition $s[i][j] = s[j][i]$ holds. I.e. it is true that the element written in the $i$-row and $j$-th column equals to the element written in the $j$-th row and $i$-th column.

Your task is to determine if Masha can construct a square of size $m \times m$ which is a symmetric matrix and consists of tiles she has. Masha can use any number of tiles of each type she has to construct the square. Note that she can not rotate tiles, she can only place them in the orientation they have in the input.

The next $2n$ lines of the test case contain descriptions of tiles types. Types of tiles are written one after another, each type is written on two lines. 

The first line of the description contains two positive (greater than zero) integers not exceeding $100$ — the number written in the top left corner of the tile and the number written in the top right corner of the tile of the current type. The second line of the description contains two positive (greater than zero) integers not exceeding $100$ — the number written in the bottom left corner of the tile and the number written in the bottom right corner of the tile of the current type.

It is forbidden to rotate tiles, it is only allowed to place them in the orientation they have in the input.


-----Output-----

For each test case print the answer: "YES" (without quotes) if Masha can construct the square of size $m \times m$ which is a symmetric matrix. Otherwise, print "NO" (withtout quotes).

-----Note-----

The first test case of the input has three types of tiles, they are shown on the picture below. [Image] 

Masha can construct, for example, the following square of size $4 \times 4$ which is a symmetric matrix: $\left. \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline 5 & {7} & {8} & {9} \\ \hline 7 & {4} & {9} & {8} \\ \hline 8 & {9} & {5} & {7} \\ \hline 9 & {8} & {7} & {4} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$

-----Plan-----
In this problem, we are given a set of tiles of different sizes and we need to determine if we can construct a square of size $m \times m$ using these tiles. The tiles are described by their top-left and bottom-right corners, and we can only place them in the orientation they have in the input.

To solve this problem, we can start by considering the case where $m = 1$. In this case, we can construct a square of size $1 \times 1$ using any number of tiles we have.

Now, let's consider the case where $m > 1$. We can divide the square into smaller squares of size $m/2 \times m/2$. If we can construct a square of size $m/2 \times m/2$ using the given tiles, then we can construct a square of size $m \times m$ by placing two copies of the smaller square side by side.

However, we need to make sure that the smaller square is a symmetric matrix. This means that the number written in the top-left corner of each tile should be equal to the number written in the bottom-right corner of each tile.

The value $|x|$ is the absolute value of $x$ and $sum(S)$ is the sum of elements of the set $S$.

In the second example you can divide the initial sequence into sets $A = \{1, 3, 4\}$ and $B = \{2, 5\}$ so the answer is $1$.

In the third example you can divide the initial sequence into sets $A = \{1, 4, 5\}$ and $B = \{2, 3, 6\}$ so the answer is $1$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum difference between the sum of the elements in set A and the sum of the elements in set B. We can do this by dividing the initial sequence into two sets A and B in such a way that each element belongs to exactly one set and the difference between the sum of the elements in set A and the sum of the elements in set B is minimum possible.

We can start by dividing the initial sequence into two sets A and B such that the first element of the sequence belongs to set A and the second element belongs to set B. We can continue this process by alternating the sets and the elements of the sequence.

For example, if the initial sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, we can divide it into sets A and B as follows:

A = {1, 3, 5}
B = {2, 4, 6}

The difference between the sum of the elements in set A and the sum of the elements in set B is 1.

We can continue this process by alternating the sets and the elements of the sequence. For example, if the initial

You are given a bracket sequence $s$ (not necessarily a regular one). A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters '(' and ')'.

A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters '1' and '+' between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "()()" and "(())" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)" and "((1+1)+1)"), and ")(", "(" and ")" are not.

Your problem is to calculate the number of regular bracket sequences of length $2n$ containing the given bracket sequence $s$ as a substring (consecutive sequence of characters) modulo $10^9+7$ ($1000000007$).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the half-length of the resulting regular bracket sequences (the resulting sequences must have length equal to $2n$).

The second line of the input contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 200$) — the string $s$ that should be a substring in each of the resulting regular bracket sequences ($|s|$ is the length of $s$).


-----Output-----

Print only one integer — the number of regular bracket sequences containing the given bracket sequence $s$ as a substring. Since this number can be huge, print it modulo $10^9+7$ ($1000000007$).

All regular bracket sequences satisfying the conditions above for the second example:   "((()))";  "(()())";  "(())()";  "()(())". 

And there is no regular bracket sequences of length $4$ containing "(((" as a substring in the third example.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of regular bracket sequences of length $2n$ that contain the given bracket sequence $s$ as a substring. A regular bracket sequence is a string that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters '1' and '+' between the original characters of the sequence.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array $dp[i][j]$ where $i$ is the length of the bracket sequence and $j$ is the length of the substring. $dp[i][j]$ represents the number of regular bracket sequences of length $i$ that contain the substring of length $j$.

We can initialize $dp[0][0] = 1$ since there is only one regular bracket sequence of length $0$ that contains the substring of length $0$.

For $i > 0$, we can calculate $dp[i][j]$ as follows:

* If $j = 0$, then $dp[i][j] = 0$ since there is no regular bracket sequence of length $i$ that contains the substring of length $0$.

You are given an integer $n$ from $1$ to $10^{18}$ without leading zeroes.

In one move you can swap any two adjacent digits in the given number in such a way that the resulting number will not contain leading zeroes. In other words, after each move the number you have cannot contain any leading zeroes.

What is the minimum number of moves you have to make to obtain a number that is divisible by $25$? Print -1 if it is impossible to obtain a number that is divisible by $25$.

If it is impossible to obtain a number that is divisible by $25$, print -1. Otherwise print the minimum number of moves required to obtain such number.

-----Note-----

In the first example one of the possible sequences of moves is 5071 $\rightarrow$ 5701 $\rightarrow$ 7501 $\rightarrow$ 7510 $\rightarrow$ 7150.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain a number that is divisible by 25.

We can start by observing that the number 25 is a prime number, and it is easy to see that any number that is divisible by 25 must have at least 5 digits.

Let's consider the number 5071. We can swap the first two digits (5 and 0) to get 5701. Then, we can swap the third and fourth digits (7 and 1) to get 7501. Finally, we can swap the last two digits (5 and 1) to get 7510.

The resulting number 7510 is divisible by 25, and we have made 4 moves to get there. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required to obtain a number that is divisible by 25 is 4.

Now, let's consider the number 1241367. We can swap the first two digits (1 and 2) to get 2141367. Then, we can swap

This is a hard version of the problem. The actual problems are different, but the easy version is almost a subtask of the hard version. Note that the constraints and the output format are different.

You are given a string $s$ consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters.

You have to color all its characters the minimum number of colors (each character to exactly one color, the same letters can be colored the same or different colors, i.e. you can choose exactly one color for each index in $s$).

After coloring, you can swap any two neighboring characters of the string that are colored different colors. You can perform such an operation arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times.

The goal is to make the string sorted, i.e. all characters should be in alphabetical order.

Your task is to find the minimum number of colors which you have to color the given string in so that after coloring it can become sorted by some sequence of swaps. Note that you have to restore only coloring, not the sequence of swaps.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of $s$.

The second line of the input contains the string $s$ consisting of exactly $n$ lowercase Latin letters.

In the first line print one integer $res$ ($1 \le res \le n$) — the minimum number of colors in which you have to color the given string so that after coloring it can become sorted by some sequence of swaps.

In the second line print any possible coloring that can be used to sort the string using some sequence of swaps described in the problem statement. The coloring is the array $c$ of length $n$, where $1 \le c_i \le res$ and $c_i$ means the color of the $i$-th character.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to consider all possible colorings of the string and calculate the minimum number of colors needed for each coloring. We can use a 2D array dp to store the minimum number of colors needed for each coloring.

The base case is when the string has only one character. In this case, we need only one color.

For the recursive case, we consider all possible colorings of the string. For each coloring, we calculate the minimum number of colors needed for the remaining string. We can use a 2D array dp to store the minimum number of colors needed for each coloring.

We can use a 2D array dp to store the minimum number of colors needed for each coloring. The dp array has two dimensions: the first dimension is the number of colors, and the second dimension is the length of the string.

Mishka started participating in a programming contest. There are $n$ problems in the contest. Mishka's problem-solving skill is equal to $k$.

Mishka arranges all problems from the contest into a list. Because of his weird principles, Mishka only solves problems from one of the ends of the list. Every time, he chooses which end (left or right) he will solve the next problem from. Thus, each problem Mishka solves is either the leftmost or the rightmost problem in the list.

Mishka cannot solve a problem with difficulty greater than $k$. When Mishka solves the problem, it disappears from the list, so the length of the list decreases by $1$. Mishka stops when he is unable to solve any problem from any end of the list.

How many problems can Mishka solve?


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, k \le 100$) — the number of problems in the contest and Mishka's problem-solving skill.

The second line of input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$), where $a_i$ is the difficulty of the $i$-th problem. The problems are given in order from the leftmost to the rightmost in the list.

In the first example, Mishka can solve problems in the following order: $[4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 6, 4] \rightarrow [2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 6, 4] \rightarrow [2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 6] \rightarrow [3, 1, 5, 1, 6] \rightarrow [1, 5, 1, 6] \rightarrow [5, 1, 6]$, so the number of solved problems will be equal to $5$.

In the second example, Mishka can't solve any problem because the difficulties of problems from both ends are greater than $k$.

In the third example, Mishka's solving skill is so amazing that he can solve all the problems.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum number of problems that Mishka can solve in a programming contest. The problem is given as a list of problems, where each problem has a difficulty level. Mishka can only solve problems with difficulty level less than or equal to his skill level.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of problems that Mishka can solve. We can do this by finding the maximum number of problems that Mishka can solve from the left end of the list, and the maximum number of problems that Mishka can solve from the right end of the list.

Let's consider the maximum number of problems that Mishka can solve from the left end of the list. We can start by solving the leftmost problem, which has difficulty level $a_1$. If the difficulty level of the next problem is less than or equal to Mishka's skill level, we can solve it and move to the next problem. If the difficulty level of the next problem is greater than Mishka's skill level, we cannot solve it and move to the next problem.

Vova has a red marker and a blue marker. Red marker can color $a$ tiles. Blue marker can color $b$ tiles. If some tile isn't white then you can't use marker of any color on it. Each marker must be drained completely, so at the end there should be exactly $a$ red tiles and exactly $b$ blue tiles across the board.

Vova wants to color such a set of tiles that:

  they would form a rectangle, consisting of exactly $a+b$ colored tiles;  all tiles of at least one color would also form a rectangle.

In the first example you can also make a rectangle with sides $1$ and $8$, though its perimeter will be $18$ which is greater than $8$.

In the second example you can make the same resulting rectangle with sides $3$ and $4$, but red tiles will form the rectangle with sides $1$ and $3$ and blue tiles will form the rectangle with sides $3$ and $3$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can be formed by coloring exactly $a$ tiles red and exactly $b$ tiles blue, such that the resulting rectangle forms a rectangle with at least one color, and the perimeter of the resulting rectangle is minimal.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by coloring the tiles with the red marker first, and then coloring the remaining tiles with the blue marker. We can keep track of the number of tiles colored with each marker, and the number of tiles colored with each color.

We can then use a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum perimeter of the resulting rectangle. We can start by considering the case where the number of tiles colored with the red marker is equal to the number of tiles colored with the blue marker. In this case, we can form a rectangle with sides $a$ and $b$, and the perimeter of the resulting rectangle is $2(a+b)$.

We can then consider the case where the number of tiles colored with the red marker is greater than the number of tiles colored with the blue marker. In this case, we can

This problem is a classic problem in computer science known as the "Coloring Problem". The problem is to determine if it is possible to color a string of characters such that after coloring it can become sorted by some sequence of swaps.

The solution to this problem is to use a technique called "Dynamic Programming". The idea is to create a table of size $n \times 2$ where $n$ is the length of the string. The table is initialized with the values of the first character of the string. The table is then filled in by considering all possible colorings of the string and the corresponding swaps.

The table is filled in as follows:

* If the current character is the first character of the string, then the table is initialized with the value of the first character.
* If the current character is not the first character of the string, then the table is initialized with the value of the previous character.
* If the current character is colored the same color as the previous character, then the table is initialized with the value of the previous character.
* If the current character is colored a different color than the previous character, then the table is initialized with the value of the previous character.

Find the price of a product before tax such that, when the consumption tax rate is 8 percent and 10 percent, the amount of consumption tax levied on it is A yen and B yen, respectively. (Yen is the currency of Japan.)
Here, the price before tax must be a positive integer, and the amount of consumption tax is rounded down to the nearest integer.
If multiple prices satisfy the condition, print the lowest such price; if no price satisfies the condition, print -1.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq A \leq B \leq 100
 - A and B are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

-----Output-----
If there is a price that satisfies the condition, print an integer representing the lowest such price; otherwise, print -1.

-----Sample Input-----
2 2

-----Sample Output-----
25

If the price of a product before tax is 25 yen, the amount of consumption tax levied on it is:
 - When the consumption tax rate is 8 percent: \lfloor 25 \times 0.08 \rfloor = \lfloor 2 \rfloor = 2 yen.
 - When the consumption tax rate is 10 percent: \lfloor 25 \times 0.1 \rfloor = \lfloor 2.5 \rfloor = 2 yen.
Thus, the price of 25 yen satisfies the condition. There are other possible prices, such as 26 yen, but print the minimum such price, 25.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the price of a product before tax such that, when the consumption tax rate is 8 percent and 10 percent, the amount of consumption tax levied on it is A yen and B yen, respectively.

First, we need to find the price of the product before tax. Let's call this price P.

Next, we need to find the amount of consumption tax levied on the product when the consumption tax rate is 8 percent. Let's call this amount T8.

We know that T8 = \lfloor P \times 0.08 \rfloor, where \lfloor \cdot \rfloor represents the greatest integer less than or equal to the argument.

We also know that T8 = B yen.

Similarly, we can find the amount of consumption tax levied on the product when the consumption tax rate is 10 percent. Let's call this amount T10.

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
Polycarp has to solve exactly $n$ problems to improve his programming skill before an important programming competition. But this competition will be held very soon, most precisely, it will start in $k$ days. It means that Polycarp has exactly $k$ days for training!

Polycarp doesn't want to procrastinate, so he wants to solve at least one problem during each of $k$ days. He also doesn't want to overwork, so if he solves $x$ problems during some day, he should solve no more than $2x$ problems during the next day. And, at last, he wants to improve his skill, so if he solves $x$ problems during some day, he should solve at least $x+1$ problem during the next day.

More formally: let $[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k]$ be the array of numbers of problems solved by Polycarp. The $i$-th element of this array is the number of problems Polycarp solves during the $i$-th day of his training. Then the following conditions must be satisfied:   sum of all $a_i$ for $i$ from $1$ to $k$ should be $n$;  $a_i$ should be greater than zero for each $i$ from $1$ to $k$;  the condition $a_i < a_{i + 1} \le 2 a_i$ should be satisfied for each $i$ from $1$ to $k-1$. 

Your problem is to find any array $a$ of length $k$ satisfying the conditions above or say that it is impossible to do it.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le 10^5$) — the number of problems Polycarp wants to solve and the number of days Polycarp wants to train.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to find any array $a$ of length $k$ satisfying Polycarp's rules of training, print "NO" in the first line.

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line, then print $k$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k$ in the second line, where $a_i$ should be the number of problems Polycarp should solve during the $i$-th day. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find an array $a$ of length $k$ that satisfies the conditions:

1. The sum of all $a_i$ for $i$ from $1$ to $k$ should be $n$.
2. $a_i$ should be greater than zero for each $i$ from $1$ to $k$.
3. The condition $a_i < a_{i + 1} \le 2 a_i$ should be satisfied for each $i$ from $1$ to $k-1$.

We can start by considering the first condition. Since the sum of all $a_i$ for $i$ from $1$ to $k$ should be $n$, we can set $a_1 = 1$ and $a_k = n - k + 1$.

Now, we need to consider the second condition. Since $a_i$ should be greater than zero for each $i$ from $1$ to $k$, we can set $a_2 = 2$ and $a_3 = 3$.

Finally, we need to consider the third condition. Since

The only difference between easy and hard versions is that you should complete all the projects in easy version but this is not necessary in hard version.

Polycarp is a very famous freelancer. His current rating is $r$ units.

Some very rich customers asked him to complete some projects for their companies. To complete the $i$-th project, Polycarp needs to have at least $a_i$ units of rating; after he completes this project, his rating will change by $b_i$ (his rating will increase or decrease by $b_i$) ($b_i$ can be positive or negative). Polycarp's rating should not fall below zero because then people won't trust such a low rated freelancer.

Polycarp can choose the order in which he completes projects. Furthermore, he can even skip some projects altogether.

To gain more experience (and money, of course) Polycarp wants to choose the subset of projects having maximum possible size and the order in which he will complete them, so he has enough rating before starting each project, and has non-negative rating after completing each project.

Your task is to calculate the maximum possible size of such subset of projects.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $r$ ($1 \le n \le 100, 1 \le r \le 30000$) — the number of projects and the initial rating of Polycarp, respectively.

The next $n$ lines contain projects, one per line. The $i$-th project is represented as a pair of integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 30000$, $-300 \le b_i \le 300$) — the rating required to complete the $i$-th project and the rating change after the project completion.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the size of the maximum possible subset (possibly, empty) of projects Polycarp can choose.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum possible size of a subset of projects that Polycarp can choose such that he has enough rating before starting each project, and has non-negative rating after completing each project.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let $dp(i, j)$ be the maximum possible size of a subset of projects that Polycarp can choose such that he has enough rating before starting each project, and has non-negative rating after completing each project, and the subset contains at most $i$ projects. If $j$ is the initial rating of Polycarp, then $dp(i, j) = 0$ if $j < 0$.

We can fill in the table in the following way:

* $dp(0, j) = 0$ for all $j \geq 0$
* $dp(i, j) = 0$ if $j < a_i$
* $dp(i, j) = dp(i - 1, j - b_i)$ if $j \geq a_i$

The maximum possible size of the subset is $dp(n, r)$.

Let's call some square matrix with integer values in its cells palindromic if it doesn't change after the order of rows is reversed and it doesn't change after the order of columns is reversed.

For example, the following matrices are palindromic: $\left[ \begin{array}{l l l}{1} & {3} & {1} \\{3} & {1} & {3} \\{1} & {3} & {1} \end{array} \right] \quad \left[ \begin{array}{l l l l}{1} & {2} & {2} & {1} \\{8} & {2} & {2} & {8} \\{8} & {2} & {2} & {8} \\{1} & {2} & {2} & {1} \end{array} \right]$ 

The following matrices are not palindromic because they change after the order of rows is reversed: $\left[ \begin{array}{l l l}{1} & {3} & {1} \\{3} & {1} & {3} \\{2} & {3} & {2} \end{array} \right] \rightarrow \left[ \begin{array}{l l l}{2} & {3} & {2} \\{3} & {1} & {3} \\{1} & {3} & {1} \end{array} \right] \quad \left[ \begin{array}{l l l l}{1} & {8} & {8} & {9} \\{2} & {4} & {3} & {2} \\{1} & {3} & {4} & {1} \\{9} & {8} & {8} & {1} \end{array} \right] \rightarrow \left[ \begin{array}{l l l l}{9} & {8} & {8} & {1} \\{1} & {3} & {4} & {1} \\{2} & {4} & {3} & {2} \\{1} & {8} & {8} & {9} \end{array} \right]$

-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 20$).

The second line contains $n^2$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{n^2}$ ($1 \le a_i \le 1000$) — the numbers to put into a matrix of $n$ rows and $n$ columns.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to put all of the $n^2$ numbers into a matrix of $n$ rows and $n$ columns so that each number is used exactly once, each cell contains exactly one number and the resulting matrix is palindromic, then print "YES". Then print $n$ lines with $n$ space-separated numbers — the resulting matrix.

If it's impossible to construct any matrix, then print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). For example, "YeS", "no" and "yES" are all acceptable.

The problem is asking you to construct a square matrix of size $n$ by $n$ such that each number from the input array is used exactly once, each cell contains exactly one number, and the resulting matrix is palindromic.

To solve this problem, you can use a combination of two techniques:

1. Construct a matrix with the input numbers in the correct order, but with some numbers repeated.
2. Reverse the order of the rows and columns of the matrix to make it palindromic.

Here's an example of how you can solve this problem:

1. Construct a matrix with the input numbers in the correct order, but with some numbers repeated. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 1, 9, 8, 4, 3, 8, 8, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2, 1, 1], you can construct a matrix like this:

Is it possible to complete all the projects? Formally, write a program to check if such an order of the projects exists, that Polycarp has enough rating before starting each project, and he has non-negative rating after completing each project.

In other words, you have to check that there exists such an order of projects in which Polycarp will complete them, so he has enough rating before starting each project, and has non-negative rating after completing each project.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking if it is possible to complete all the projects in a way that Polycarp has enough rating before starting each project, and he has non-negative rating after completing each project.

To solve this problem, we need to find a way to order the projects such that Polycarp has enough rating before starting each project, and he has non-negative rating after completing each project.

We can start by sorting the projects by the amount of rating required to complete them. We can then try to complete the projects in this order, starting with the first project. If Polycarp has enough rating to complete the first project, we can complete it and then move on to the next project. If he doesn't have enough rating to complete the first project, we can't complete it and we need to find a way to complete the previous projects before moving on to the next project.

We can continue this process until we have completed all the projects. If we have enough rating to complete all the projects, we can print "YES". Otherwise, we can print "NO".

In summary, the solution to this problem is to sort the projects by the amount of rating required to complete them, and then try

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
There is a river of width $n$. The left bank of the river is cell $0$ and the right bank is cell $n + 1$ (more formally, the river can be represented as a sequence of $n + 2$ cells numbered from $0$ to $n + 1$). There are also $m$ wooden platforms on a river, the $i$-th platform has length $c_i$ (so the $i$-th platform takes $c_i$ consecutive cells of the river). It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of platforms does not exceed $n$.

You are standing at $0$ and want to reach $n+1$ somehow. If you are standing at the position $x$, you can jump to any position in the range $[x + 1; x + d]$. However you don't really like the water so you can jump only to such cells that belong to some wooden platform. For example, if $d=1$, you can jump only to the next position (if it belongs to the wooden platform). You can assume that cells $0$ and $n+1$ belong to wooden platforms.

You want to know if it is possible to reach $n+1$ from $0$ if you can move any platform to the left or to the right arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) as long as they do not intersect each other (but two platforms can touch each other). It also means that you cannot change the relative order of platforms.

Note that you should move platforms until you start jumping (in other words, you first move the platforms and then start jumping).

For example, if $n=7$, $m=3$, $d=2$ and $c = [1, 2, 1]$, then one of the ways to reach $8$ from $0$ is follow:

 [Image] The first example: $n=7$. 


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $d$ ($1 \le n, m, d \le 1000, m \le n$) — the width of the river, the number of platforms and the maximum distance of your jump, correspondingly.

The second line of the input contains $m$ integers $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_m$ ($1 \le c_i \le n, \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} c_i \le n$), where $c_i$ is the length of the $i$-th platform.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to reach $n+1$ from $0$, print NO in the first line. Otherwise, print YES in the first line and the array $a$ of length $n$ in the second line — the sequence of river cells (excluding cell $0$ and cell $n + 1$).

If the cell $i$ does not belong to any platform, $a_i$ should be $0$. Otherwise, it should be equal to the index of the platform ($1$-indexed, platforms are numbered from $1$ to $m$ in order of input) to which the cell $i$ belongs.

Note that all $a_i$ equal to $1$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_1$, all $a_i$ equal to $2$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_2$, ..., all $a_i$ equal to $m$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_m$. The leftmost position of $2$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $1$, the leftmost position of $3$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $2$, ..., the leftmost position of $m$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $m-1$.

See example outputs for better understanding.

Output
YES
0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 



-----Note-----

Consider the first example: the answer is $[0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3]$. The sequence of jumps you perform is $0 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 8$.

Consider the second example: it does not matter how to place the platform because you always can jump from $0$ to $11$.

Consider the third example: the answer is $[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$. The sequence of jumps you perform is $0 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 11$.

-----Plan-----
This problem is a classic problem in dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of jumps required to reach cell i from cell 0, where j is the number of platforms that have been moved to the left or right.

The base case is dp[i][0] = 1, since we need to jump from cell 0 to cell i.

The recurrence relation is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-c_j][j-1] + 1), where c_j is the length of the j-th platform.

The answer is YES if dp[n+1][m] is less than or equal to d, otherwise the answer is NO.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2m), where n is the width of the river and m is the number of platforms. The space complexity is O(n^2m).

The only difference between easy and hard versions is the length of the string.

You are given a string $s$ and a string $t$, both consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that $t$ can be obtained from $s$ by removing some (possibly, zero) number of characters (not necessary contiguous) from $s$ without changing order of remaining characters (in other words, it is guaranteed that $t$ is a subsequence of $s$).

For example, the strings "test", "tst", "tt", "et" and "" are subsequences of the string "test". But the strings "tset", "se", "contest" are not subsequences of the string "test".

You want to remove some substring (contiguous subsequence) from $s$ of maximum possible length such that after removing this substring $t$ will remain a subsequence of $s$.

If you want to remove the substring $s[l;r]$ then the string $s$ will be transformed to $s_1 s_2 \dots s_{l-1} s_{r+1} s_{r+2} \dots s_{|s|-1} s_{|s|}$ (where $|s|$ is the length of $s$).

Your task is to find the maximum possible length of the substring you can remove so that $t$ is still a subsequence of $s$.

The problem is to find the maximum length of a substring of $s$ that can be removed such that $t$ remains a subsequence of $s$.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let $f(i, j)$ be the maximum length of a substring of $s$ that can be removed such that $t$ remains a subsequence of $s$ and the substring ends at position $i$ in $s$. We can compute $f(i, j)$ for each $i$ and $j$ as follows:

* If $i = 0$, then $f(0, j) = 0$.
* If $j = 0$, then $f(i, 0) = 0$.
* If $s[i] = t[j]$, then $f(i, j) = f(i - 1, j - 1) + 1$.
* Otherwise, $f(i, j) = max(f(i - 1, j), f(i, j - 1))$.

The answer is $f(n, m)$, where $n$ is the length of $s$ and

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find two integers between 1 and 10, inclusive, that, when added together, give the closest possible sum to the input number x.

To solve this problem, we can start by rounding x to the nearest integer. Let's call this rounded value y.

Next, we can find the absolute difference between x and y. This difference will give us the closest possible sum to x.

For example, if x = 1.200000, y = 1, and the absolute difference is 0.200000.

Now, we can find the closest possible sum to x by adding the absolute difference to y. In this case, the closest possible sum is 1 + 0.200000 = 1.200000.

Therefore, the output for x = 1.200000 is 3 2, where 3 is the integer part of 1.200000 and 2 is the fractional part.

Similarly, for x = 2.572479, the closest possible sum

You are given three integers $n$, $d$ and $k$.

Your task is to construct an undirected tree on $n$ vertices with diameter $d$ and degree of each vertex at most $k$, or say that it is impossible.

An undirected tree is a connected undirected graph with $n - 1$ edges.

Diameter of a tree is the maximum length of a simple path (a path in which each vertex appears at most once) between all pairs of vertices of this tree.

Degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to this vertex (i.e. for a vertex $u$ it is the number of edges $(u, v)$ that belong to the tree, where $v$ is any other vertex of a tree).

If there is no tree satisfying the conditions above, print only one word "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes), and then print $n - 1$ lines describing edges of a tree satisfying the conditions above.

To solve this problem, we need to construct an undirected tree on $n$ vertices with diameter $d$ and degree of each vertex at most $k$.

First, we can construct a tree with diameter $d$ by connecting each vertex to its $k$ nearest neighbors. We can do this by creating a graph with $n$ vertices and $n - 1$ edges, where each edge connects two vertices that are at most $d$ apart.

Next, we need to ensure that the degree of each vertex is at most $k$. We can do this by connecting each vertex to its $k$ nearest neighbors, and then connecting each vertex to its $k$ nearest neighbors that are not already connected to it.

Finally, we need to ensure that the tree is undirected. We can do this by connecting each vertex to its $k$ nearest neighbors in both directions.

Here is an example of how we can construct a tree with diameter $d = 2$ and degree of each vertex at most $k = 3$:

1. Create a graph with $n = 6$ vertices and $n - 1 = 5$ edges.

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
You are given three integers $a$, $b$ and $x$. Your task is to construct a binary string $s$ of length $n = a + b$ such that there are exactly $a$ zeroes, exactly $b$ ones and exactly $x$ indices $i$ (where $1 \le i < n$) such that $s_i \ne s_{i + 1}$. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.

For example, for the string "01010" there are four indices $i$ such that $1 \le i < n$ and $s_i \ne s_{i + 1}$ ($i = 1, 2, 3, 4$). For the string "111001" there are two such indices $i$ ($i = 3, 5$).

Recall that binary string is a non-empty sequence of characters where each character is either 0 or 1.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $a$, $b$ and $x$ ($1 \le a, b \le 100, 1 \le x < a + b)$.


-----Output-----

Print only one string $s$, where $s$ is any binary string satisfying conditions described above. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to construct a binary string of length $a + b$ that has exactly $a$ zeroes, exactly $b$ ones, and exactly $x$ indices $i$ such that $s_i \ne s_{i + 1}$.

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of the following two strategies:

1. Fill the string with zeroes and ones alternately.
2. Fill the string with zeroes and ones in a way that ensures that there are exactly $x$ indices $i$ such that $s_i \ne s_{i + 1}$.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Fill the string with zeroes and ones alternately.

We can do this by starting with a string of all zeroes, and then alternating between adding a one and a zero to the end of the string. For example, if we start with a string of all zeroes, we can add a one to the end to get "010000", and then add a zero to the end to get "0100000". We can continue this process to get a

You are given two strings $s$ and $t$ both of length $2$ and both consisting only of characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.

Possible examples of strings $s$ and $t$: "ab", "ca", "bb".

You have to find a string $res$ consisting of $3n$ characters, $n$ characters should be 'a', $n$ characters should be 'b' and $n$ characters should be 'c' and $s$ and $t$ should not occur in $res$ as substrings.

A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. So, the strings "ab", "ac" and "cc" are substrings of the string "abacc", but the strings "bc", "aa" and "cb" are not substrings of the string "abacc".

If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of characters 'a', 'b' and 'c' in the resulting string.

The second line of the input contains one string $s$ of length $2$ consisting of characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.

The third line of the input contains one string $t$ of length $2$ consisting of characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to find the suitable string, print "NO" on the first line. 

Otherwise print "YES" on the first line and string $res$ on the second line. $res$ should consist of $3n$ characters, $n$ characters should be 'a', $n$ characters should be 'b' and $n$ characters should be 'c' and $s$ and $t$ should not occur in $res$ as substrings.

If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

To solve this problem, we need to create a string of length $3n$ that consists of $n$ 'a', $n$ 'b', and $n$ 'c' characters. We also need to make sure that the strings $s$ and $t$ do not appear as substrings in the resulting string.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. Create a string of length $3n$ consisting of $n$ 'a', $n$ 'b', and $n$ 'c' characters.
2. Check if the string $s$ and $t$ appear as substrings in the resulting string. If they do, then we need to create a new string that does not contain $s$ and $t$ as substrings.
3. If the string $s$ and $t$ do not appear as substrings in the resulting string, then we can print "YES" on the first line and the resulting string on the second line.
4. If it is impossible to find the suitable string, then we can print "NO" on the first line.

An array of integers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ is called a permutation if it contains each number from $1$ to $n$ exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: $[3, 1, 2]$, $[1]$, $[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ and $[4, 3, 1, 2]$. The following arrays are not permutations: $[2]$, $[1, 1]$, $[2, 3, 4]$.

Polycarp invented a really cool permutation $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ of length $n$. It is very disappointing, but he forgot this permutation. He only remembers the array $q_1, q_2, \dots, q_{n-1}$ of length $n-1$, where $q_i=p_{i+1}-p_i$.

Given $n$ and $q=q_1, q_2, \dots, q_{n-1}$, help Polycarp restore the invented permutation.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5$) — the length of the permutation to restore. The second line contains $n-1$ integers $q_1, q_2, \dots, q_{n-1}$ ($-n < q_i < n$).


-----Output-----

Print the integer -1 if there is no such permutation of length $n$ which corresponds to the given array $q$. Otherwise, if it exists, print $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$. Print any such permutation if there are many of them.


-----Examples-----

Output

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find a permutation of length $n$ that corresponds to the given array $q$. We can do this by using the information that $q_i=p_{i+1}-p_i$.

We can start by creating an array $p$ of length $n$ where $p_i=i$ for all $i$. Then, we can iterate through the array $q$ and update the values in $p$ accordingly. For example, if $q_i=2$, we know that $p_{i+1}=p_i+2$, so we can set $p_{i+1}=p_i+2$ and $p_{i+2}=p_{i+1}+1=p_i+3$.

Once we have updated the values in $p$, we can check if the resulting permutation is a permutation. If it is not a permutation, we can print -1. Otherwise, we can print the resulting permutation.

Here is an example of how this would work:

You are given $n$ chips on a number line. The $i$-th chip is placed at the integer coordinate $x_i$. Some chips can have equal coordinates.

You can perform each of the two following types of moves any (possibly, zero) number of times on any chip:

  Move the chip $i$ by $2$ to the left or $2$ to the right for free (i.e. replace the current coordinate $x_i$ with $x_i - 2$ or with $x_i + 2$);  move the chip $i$ by $1$ to the left or $1$ to the right and pay one coin for this move (i.e. replace the current coordinate $x_i$ with $x_i - 1$ or with $x_i + 1$). 

Note that it's allowed to move chips to any integer coordinate, including negative and zero.

Your task is to find the minimum total number of coins required to move all $n$ chips to the same coordinate (i.e. all $x_i$ should be equal after some sequence of moves).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of chips.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ ($1 \le x_i \le 10^9$), where $x_i$ is the coordinate of the $i$-th chip.

-----Examples-----
Input

Output

Input

-----Note-----

In the first example you need to move the first chip by $2$ to the right and the second chip by $1$ to the right or move the third chip by $2$ to the left and the second chip by $1$ to the left so the answer is $1$.

In the second example you need to move two chips with coordinate $3$ by $1$ to the left so the answer is $2$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of coins required to move all n chips to the same coordinate. The chips can be moved by 2 to the left or 2 to the right or 1 to the left or 1 to the right and the cost of each move is 1 coin. The chips can be moved to any integer coordinate, including negative and zero.

The solution is to find the minimum number of coins required to move each chip to the same coordinate. The cost of moving a chip to the same coordinate is 0 coins. The cost of moving a chip to a different coordinate is 1 coin.

The solution can be solved using dynamic programming. The dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of coins required to move the first i chips to the same coordinate and the j-th chip is at the coordinate j. The dp[i][j] can be calculated using the following formula:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-2] + 1, dp[i-1][j-1] + 1, dp[i-1][j+1] + 1,

The problem is to find the minimum number of moves needed to reach a square that contains the integer N. The square (i,j) contains the integer i \times j. Initially, Takahashi is standing at (1,1). In one move, he can move from (i,j) to either (i+1,j) or (i,j+1).

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of moves needed to reach the square (i,j). We can initialize dp[1][1] = 0, as we are already standing at (1,1).

For each move, we can either move down or right. If we move down, we can reach the square (i+1,j) in one move. If we move right, we can reach the square (i,j+1) in one move.

We can calculate dp[i][j] as follows:

Alice and Bob have decided to play the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". 

The game consists of several rounds, each round is independent of each other. In each round, both players show one of the following things at the same time: rock, paper or scissors. If both players showed the same things then the round outcome is a draw. Otherwise, the following rules applied:

  if one player showed rock and the other one showed scissors, then the player who showed rock is considered the winner and the other one is considered the loser;  if one player showed scissors and the other one showed paper, then the player who showed scissors is considered the winner and the other one is considered the loser;  if one player showed paper and the other one showed rock, then the player who showed paper is considered the winner and the other one is considered the loser. 

Alice and Bob decided to play exactly $n$ rounds of the game described above. Alice decided to show rock $a_1$ times, show scissors $a_2$ times and show paper $a_3$ times. Bob decided to show rock $b_1$ times, show scissors $b_2$ times and show paper $b_3$ times. Though, both Alice and Bob did not choose the sequence in which they show things. It is guaranteed that $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = n$ and $b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = n$.

Your task is to find two numbers:

  the minimum number of round Alice can win;  the maximum number of rounds Alice can win. 


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$) — the number of rounds.

The second line of the input contains three integers $a_1, a_2, a_3$ ($0 \le a_i \le n$) — the number of times Alice will show rock, scissors and paper, respectively. It is guaranteed that $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = n$.

The third line of the input contains three integers $b_1, b_2, b_3$ ($0 \le b_j \le n$) — the number of times Bob will show rock, scissors and paper, respectively. It is guaranteed that $b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = n$.

-----Note-----

In the first example, Alice will not win any rounds if she shows scissors and then paper and Bob shows rock and then scissors. In the best outcome, Alice will win one round if she shows paper and then scissors, and Bob shows rock and then scissors.

In the second example, Alice will not win any rounds if Bob shows the same things as Alice each round.

In the third example, Alice always shows paper and Bob always shows rock so Alice will win all three rounds anyway.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum and maximum number of rounds that Alice can win in the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors".

Let's first consider the case where Alice and Bob both show the same thing each round. In this case, Alice will win the round if she shows the opposite thing to what Bob shows. For example, if Alice shows rock and Bob shows scissors, Alice will win the round.

Now, let's consider the case where Alice and Bob show different things each round. In this case, we can find the minimum and maximum number of rounds that Alice can win as follows:

Minimum number of rounds that Alice can win:

* If Alice shows rock and Bob shows scissors, Alice will win the round.
* If Alice shows scissors and Bob shows paper, Alice will win the round.
* If Alice shows paper and Bob shows rock, Alice will win the round.

Therefore, the minimum number of rounds that Alice can win is 3.

Maximum number of rounds that Alice can win:

* If Alice shows rock and Bob shows paper, Alice will win the

This problem is given in two editions, which differ exclusively in the constraints on the number $n$.

You are given an array of integers $a[1], a[2], \dots, a[n].$ A block is a sequence of contiguous (consecutive) elements $a[l], a[l+1], \dots, a[r]$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$). Thus, a block is defined by a pair of indices $(l, r)$.

Find a set of blocks $(l_1, r_1), (l_2, r_2), \dots, (l_k, r_k)$ such that:

  They do not intersect (i.e. they are disjoint). Formally, for each pair of blocks $(l_i, r_i)$ and $(l_j, r_j$) where $i \neq j$ either $r_i < l_j$ or $r_j < l_i$.  For each block the sum of its elements is the same. Formally, $$a[l_1]+a[l_1+1]+\dots+a[r_1]=a[l_2]+a[l_2+1]+\dots+a[r_2]=$$ $$\dots =$$ $$a[l_k]+a[l_k+1]+\dots+a[r_k].$$  The number of the blocks in the set is maximum. Formally, there does not exist a set of blocks $(l_1', r_1'), (l_2', r_2'), \dots, (l_{k'}', r_{k'}')$ satisfying the above two requirements with $k' > k$. 

 $\left. \begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline 4 & {1} & {2} & {2} & {1} & {5} & {3} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$ The picture corresponds to the first example. Blue boxes illustrate blocks.

In the first line print the integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le n$). The following $k$ lines should contain blocks, one per line. In each line print a pair of indices $l_i, r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) — the bounds of the $i$-th block. You can print blocks in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Everybody knows of spaghetti sort. You decided to implement an analog sorting algorithm yourself, but as you survey your pantry you realize you're out of spaghetti! The only type of pasta you have is ravioli, but you are not going to let this stop you...

You come up with the following algorithm. For each number in the array a_{i}, build a stack of a_{i} ravioli. The image shows the stack for a_{i} = 4.

 [Image] 

Arrange the stacks in one row in the order in which the corresponding numbers appear in the input array. Find the tallest one (if there are several stacks of maximal height, use the leftmost one). Remove it and add its height to the end of the output array. Shift the stacks in the row so that there is no gap between them. Repeat the procedure until all stacks have been removed.

At first you are very happy with your algorithm, but as you try it on more inputs you realize that it doesn't always produce the right sorted array. Turns out when two stacks of ravioli are next to each other (at any step of the process) and differ in height by two or more, the top ravioli of the taller stack slides down on top of the lower stack.

Given an input array, figure out whether the described algorithm will sort it correctly.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains a single number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) — the size of the array.

The second line of input contains n space-separated integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of the array.


-----Output-----

Output "YES" if the array can be sorted using the described procedure and "NO" if it can not.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 2 3

Output
YES

Input
3
3 1 2

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the second example the array will change even before the tallest stack is chosen for the first time: ravioli from stack of height 3 will slide on the stack of height 1, and the algorithm will output an array {2, 2, 2}.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking whether the described algorithm will sort the input array correctly. The algorithm is based on the idea of building a stack of ravioli for each number in the array, and then arranging the stacks in one row in the order of the corresponding numbers. The algorithm will remove the tallest stack and add its height to the end of the output array, and then shift the remaining stacks in the row so that there is no gap between them.

The problem is that the algorithm is not guaranteed to produce the correct sorted array. In the second example, the array will change even before the tallest stack is chosen for the first time, and the algorithm will output an array {2, 2, 2} instead of {1, 2, 3}. This is because the algorithm is not considering the possibility that two stacks of ravioli may be next to each other and differ in height by two or more, and the top ravioli of the taller stack may slide down on top of the lower stack.

Therefore, the algorithm will not sort the input array correctly in all cases, and the output will be "NO" in those cases.

You are given two strings $s$ and $t$. Both strings have length $n$ and consist of lowercase Latin letters. The characters in the strings are numbered from $1$ to $n$.

You can successively perform the following move any number of times (possibly, zero):  swap any two adjacent (neighboring) characters of $s$ (i.e. for any $i = \{1, 2, \dots, n - 1\}$ you can swap $s_i$ and $s_{i + 1})$. 

You can't apply a move to the string $t$. The moves are applied to the string $s$ one after another.

Your task is to obtain the string $t$ from the string $s$. Find any way to do it with at most $10^4$ such moves.

You do not have to minimize the number of moves, just find any sequence of moves of length $10^4$ or less to transform $s$ into $t$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 50$) — the length of strings $s$ and $t$.

The second line of the input contains the string $s$ consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters.

The third line of the input contains the string $t$ consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to obtain the string $t$ using moves, print "-1".

Otherwise in the first line print one integer $k$ — the number of moves to transform $s$ to $t$. Note that $k$ must be an integer number between $0$ and $10^4$ inclusive.

In the second line print $k$ integers $c_j$ ($1 \le c_j < n$), where $c_j$ means that on the $j$-th move you swap characters $s_{c_j}$ and $s_{c_j + 1}$.

If you do not need to apply any moves, print a single integer $0$ in the first line and either leave the second line empty or do not print it at all.


-----Examples-----
Input

abcdef
abdfec

Output
4
3 5 4 5

-----Note-----

In the first example the string $s$ changes as follows: "abcdef" $\rightarrow$ "abdcef" $\rightarrow$ "abdcfe" $\rightarrow$ "abdfce" $\rightarrow$ "abdfec".

In the second example there is no way to transform the string $s$ into the string $t$ through any allowed moves.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that transforms the string $s$ into the string $t$. We can do this by swapping adjacent characters in $s$ to bring it closer to $t$.

We can start by swapping the first two characters of $s$ with the first two characters of $t$. If the characters are different, we are done. If they are the same, we can continue by swapping the next two characters of $s$ with the next two characters of $t$, and so on.

We can continue this process until we have transformed $s$ into $t$. However, we need to be careful not to swap characters that are already in the correct position. We can do this by keeping track of the characters that have already been swapped and only swapping characters that are not in the correct position.

Once we have transformed $s$ into $t$, we can print the number of moves required to do so, which is the number of swaps we made. We can also print the indices of the characters that were swapped, which will be the indices of the characters in $s$ that were swapped with the corresponding characters in $t$.

Ivan wants to play a game with you. He picked some string $s$ of length $n$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. 

You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $1$ to $n-1$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.

Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $2n-2$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer number $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the length of the guessed string $s$.

The next $2n-2$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $1$ to $n-1$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.

It is guaranteed that there are exactly $2$ strings of each length from $1$ to $n-1$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $n$.


-----Output-----

Print one string of length $2n-2$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $i$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $i$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.

If there are several possible answers, you can print any.

-----Note-----

The only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is "ababa".

The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is "aaa". Answers "SPSP", "SSPP" and "PSPS" are also acceptable.

In the third example Ivan can guess the string "ac" or the string "ca". The answer "SP" is also acceptable.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the longest common prefix and suffix of the given strings. We can do this by comparing each string with the others and keeping track of the longest common prefix and suffix.

Let's consider the first example. The given strings are "ba", "a", "abab", "a", "aba", and "baba". We can start by comparing the first two strings, "ba" and "a". The longest common prefix is "a", so we add an "S" to the output string.

Next, we compare "ba" with "abab". The longest common prefix is "ab", so we add an "S" to the output string.

Now we compare "a" with "aba". The longest common prefix is "a", so we add an "S" to the output string.

Finally, we compare "aba" with "baba". The longest common prefix is "aba", so we add an "S" to the output string.

The output string is "SPPSPSPS".

In the second example, the longest common prefix is "aa", so the output string is "PPSS".

There is a house with $n$ flats situated on the main street of Berlatov. Vova is watching this house every night. The house can be represented as an array of $n$ integer numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, where $a_i = 1$ if in the $i$-th flat the light is on and $a_i = 0$ otherwise.

Vova thinks that people in the $i$-th flats are disturbed and cannot sleep if and only if $1 < i < n$ and $a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} = 1$ and $a_i = 0$.

Vova is concerned by the following question: what is the minimum number $k$ such that if people from exactly $k$ pairwise distinct flats will turn off the lights then nobody will be disturbed? Your task is to find this number $k$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 100$) — the number of flats in the house.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($a_i \in \{0, 1\}$), where $a_i$ is the state of light in the $i$-th flat.


-----Output-----

Print only one integer — the minimum number $k$ such that if people from exactly $k$ pairwise distinct flats will turn off the light then nobody will be disturbed.

-----Note-----

In the first example people from flats $2$ and $7$ or $4$ and $7$ can turn off the light and nobody will be disturbed. It can be shown that there is no better answer in this example.

There are no disturbed people in second and third examples.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the minimum number of flats that need to turn off their lights so that no one is disturbed. The condition for being disturbed is that there are two people in adjacent flats (i.e., flats $i$ and $i+1$) who are both awake (i.e., their lights are on).

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of flats that need to turn off their lights so that no two adjacent flats have both lights on. We can do this by finding the minimum number of flats that need to turn off their lights so that no two adjacent flats have both lights on, and then subtracting 1 from that number.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Find the minimum number of flats that need to turn off their lights so that no two adjacent flats have both lights on.
2. Subtract 1 from the number found in step 1.

For example, suppose we have a house with 10 flats, and the lights in the flats are as follows:

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers.

Your task is to say the number of such positive integers $x$ such that $x$ divides each number from the array. In other words, you have to find the number of common divisors of all elements in the array.

For example, if the array $a$ will be $[2, 4, 6, 2, 10]$, then $1$ and $2$ divide each number from the array (so the answer for this test is $2$).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 4 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in $a$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^{12}$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of common divisors of all elements in the array.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the first two elements in the array. We can then find the gcd of the first three elements, and so on.

We can continue this process until we have found the gcd of all $n$ elements in the array. The number of common divisors of all elements in the array is equal to the number of times the gcd appears in the array.

For example, if the array is $[2, 4, 6, 2, 10]$, the gcd of the first two elements is $2$, the gcd of the first three elements is $2$, the gcd of the first four elements is $2$, and the gcd of all five elements is $1$. Therefore, the answer is $1$.

In summary, the solution to this problem is to find the gcd of all elements in the array and count the number of times the gcd appears in the array.

Polycarp has $n$ coins, the value of the $i$-th coin is $a_i$. Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins between his pockets, but he cannot put two coins with the same value into the same pocket.

Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins with the minimum number of used pockets. Help him to do that.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to distribute a set of coins into the minimum number of pockets such that no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We can sort the coins in non-decreasing order of their values. Then, we can start distributing the coins into pockets. For each coin, we can either put it into a new pocket or put it into an existing pocket that has a different value.

We can keep track of the number of pockets we need to distribute the coins into. We can start with one pocket and add a new pocket for each coin we distribute. If we have already distributed a coin with the same value as the current coin, we can put it into the same pocket.

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n\log n)$ because we need to sort the coins in non-decreasing order of their values. The space complexity is $O(n)$ because we need to keep track of the number of pockets we need to distribute the coins into.

The algorithm works as follows:

Vova's house is an array consisting of $n$ elements (yeah, this is the first problem, I think, where someone lives in the array). There are heaters in some positions of the array. The $i$-th element of the array is $1$ if there is a heater in the position $i$, otherwise the $i$-th element of the array is $0$.

Each heater has a value $r$ ($r$ is the same for all heaters). This value means that the heater at the position $pos$ can warm up all the elements in range $[pos - r + 1; pos + r - 1]$.

Vova likes to walk through his house while he thinks, and he hates cold positions of his house. Vova wants to switch some of his heaters on in such a way that each element of his house will be warmed up by at least one heater. 

Vova's target is to warm up the whole house (all the elements of the array), i.e. if $n = 6$, $r = 2$ and heaters are at positions $2$ and $5$, then Vova can warm up the whole house if he switches all the heaters in the house on (then the first $3$ elements will be warmed up by the first heater and the last $3$ elements will be warmed up by the second heater).

Initially, all the heaters are off.

But from the other hand, Vova didn't like to pay much for the electricity. So he wants to switch the minimum number of heaters on in such a way that each element of his house is warmed up by at least one heater.

Your task is to find this number of heaters or say that it is impossible to warm up the whole house.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $r$ ($1 \le n, r \le 1000$) — the number of elements in the array and the value of heaters.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 1$) — the Vova's house description.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum number of heaters needed to warm up the whole house or -1 if it is impossible to do it.

-----Note-----

In the first example the heater at the position $2$ warms up elements $[1; 3]$, the heater at the position $3$ warms up elements $[2, 4]$ and the heater at the position $6$ warms up elements $[5; 6]$ so the answer is $3$.

In the second example the heater at the position $1$ warms up elements $[1; 3]$ and the heater at the position $5$ warms up elements $[3; 5]$ so the answer is $2$.

In the third example there are no heaters so the answer is -1.

In the fourth example the heater at the position $3$ warms up elements $[1; 5]$, the heater at the position $6$ warms up elements $[4; 8]$ and the heater at the position $10$ warms up elements $[8; 10]$ so the answer is $3$.

-----Plan-----
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of heaters needed to warm up the first i elements of the array, where the j-th heater is on.

The base case is dp[0][j] = 0, since there is no need to turn on any heaters to warm up the first 0 elements of the array.

For the recursive case, we consider all possible positions of the j-th heater in the array. If the j-th heater is turned on, then we need to consider the following cases:

* The j-th heater is turned on and warms up the first i elements of the array. In this case, we need to consider the following cases:
	+ The j-th heater is turned on and warms up the first i-1 elements of the array. In this case, we need to consider the following cases:
		- The j-th heater is turned on and warms up the first i-2 elements of the array. In this case, we need to consider the following cases:

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of tuples (A, B, C) of positive integers that satisfy the equation A \* B + C = N.

To solve this problem, we can use a brute force approach. We can start by considering all possible values of A, B, and C, and then check if the equation is satisfied.

We can start by considering all possible values of A, which can range from 1 to N. For each value of A, we can consider all possible values of B, which can range from 1 to N - A. For each value of A and B, we can consider all possible values of C, which can range from 1 to N - A - B.

For each value of A, B, and C, we can check if the equation A \* B + C = N is satisfied. If it is, we can count it as one tuple.

The time complexity of this approach is O(N^3), since we need to consider all possible values of A, B, and C. However, this approach is not efficient enough for large values of N.

To improve the efficiency of this approach, we can use a more efficient

The only difference between easy and hard versions is the length of the string.

You are given a string $s$ and a string $t$, both consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that $t$ can be obtained from $s$ by removing some (possibly, zero) number of characters (not necessary contiguous) from $s$ without changing order of remaining characters (in other words, it is guaranteed that $t$ is a subsequence of $s$).

For example, the strings "test", "tst", "tt", "et" and "" are subsequences of the string "test". But the strings "tset", "se", "contest" are not subsequences of the string "test".

You want to remove some substring (contiguous subsequence) from $s$ of maximum possible length such that after removing this substring $t$ will remain a subsequence of $s$.

If you want to remove the substring $s[l;r]$ then the string $s$ will be transformed to $s_1 s_2 \dots s_{l-1} s_{r+1} s_{r+2} \dots s_{|s|-1} s_{|s|}$ (where $|s|$ is the length of $s$).

Your task is to find the maximum possible length of the substring you can remove so that $t$ is still a subsequence of $s$.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum length of the substring that can be removed from the string s such that the string t is still a subsequence of s.

We can use a hash table to keep track of the substrings of t that are already present in s. We can initialize the hash table with all the substrings of t.

We can then fill the dp array as follows:

* dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + 1) if t is a subsequence of s[0..

If x = 1 and y = 1 then x \times y = 1.

Therefore, the answer is 2.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum value of x \* y, where x and y are integers and a <= x <= b and c <= y <= d hold.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of x \* y for all possible values of x and y that satisfy the given constraints.

We can start by finding the maximum value of x for the given constraints. The maximum value of x is 10^9, since a <= x <= b.

Next, we need to find the maximum value of y for the given constraints. The maximum value of y is also 10^9, since c <= y <= d.

Now, we need to find the maximum value of x \* y for all possible values of x and y that satisfy the given constraints. We can do this by iterating over all possible values of x and y and finding the maximum value of x \* y.

The maximum value of x \* y is 10^18, since x and y can take any value between -10^9 and 10^9.

Therefore, the answer is 10^18.

 - A problem with difficulty lower than K will be for ABCs.
How many choices of the integer K make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same?

Thus, the answer is 2.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the number of choices of the integer K that make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of choices of K that make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same.

Let's consider the number of problems for ARCs as A and the number of problems for ABCs as B.

We know that A + B = N, since there are N problems in total.

We also know that A >= B, since all problems with difficulty K or higher will be for ARCs.

We can write an equation to represent this:

A + B = N
A >= B

We can solve this equation by subtracting A from both sides:

B = N - A

Now we have:

B = N - A

We can substitute the value of A from the previous equation:

B = N - (A + B)

We can simplify this equation:

B = N - (N - B)

We can simplify this equation further:

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
Vova had a pretty weird sleeping schedule. There are $h$ hours in a day. Vova will sleep exactly $n$ times. The $i$-th time he will sleep exactly after $a_i$ hours from the time he woke up. You can assume that Vova woke up exactly at the beginning of this story (the initial time is $0$). Each time Vova sleeps exactly one day (in other words, $h$ hours).

Vova thinks that the $i$-th sleeping time is good if he starts to sleep between hours $l$ and $r$ inclusive.

Vova can control himself and before the $i$-th time can choose between two options: go to sleep after $a_i$ hours or after $a_i - 1$ hours.

Your task is to say the maximum number of good sleeping times Vova can obtain if he acts optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains four integers $n, h, l$ and $r$ ($1 \le n \le 2000, 3 \le h \le 2000, 0 \le l \le r < h$) — the number of times Vova goes to sleep, the number of hours in a day and the segment of the good sleeping time.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i < h$), where $a_i$ is the number of hours after which Vova goes to sleep the $i$-th time.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the maximum number of good sleeping times Vova can obtain if he acts optimally.


-----Example-----
Input
7 24 21 23
16 17 14 20 20 11 22

Output
3



-----Note-----

The maximum number of good times in the example is $3$.

The story starts from $t=0$. Then Vova goes to sleep after $a_1 - 1$ hours, now the time is $15$. This time is not good. Then Vova goes to sleep after $a_2 - 1$ hours, now the time is $15 + 16 = 7$. This time is also not good. Then Vova goes to sleep after $a_3$ hours, now the time is $7 + 14 = 21$. This time is good. Then Vova goes to sleep after $a_4 - 1$ hours, now the time is $21 + 19 = 16$. This time is not good. Then Vova goes to sleep after $a_5$ hours, now the time is $16 + 20 = 12$. This time is not good. Then Vova goes to sleep after $a_6$ hours, now the time is $12 + 11 = 23$. This time is good. Then Vova goes to sleep after $a_7$ hours, now the time is $23 + 22 = 21$. This time is also good.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the maximum number of good sleeping times that Vova can obtain if he acts optimally. To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal way for Vova to sleep at different times during the day.

Let's consider the $i$-th sleeping time. Vova can choose to sleep after $a_i$ hours or after $a_i - 1$ hours. If he chooses to sleep after $a_i$ hours, then the time when he goes to sleep is $a_i$ hours after the time when he woke up. If he chooses to sleep after $a_i - 1$ hours, then the time when he goes to sleep is $a_i - 1$ hours after the time when he woke up.

The optimal way for Vova to sleep at different times during the day is to choose the time when he goes to sleep such that the time when he wakes up is within the segment of the good sleeping time. In other words, Vova should choose the time when he goes to sleep such that the time when he wakes up is between $l$ and $r$ inclusive.

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
You are given a problemset consisting of $n$ problems. The difficulty of the $i$-th problem is $a_i$. It is guaranteed that all difficulties are distinct and are given in the increasing order.

You have to assemble the contest which consists of some problems of the given problemset. In other words, the contest you have to assemble should be a subset of problems (not necessary consecutive) of the given problemset. There is only one condition that should be satisfied: for each problem but the hardest one (the problem with the maximum difficulty) there should be a problem with the difficulty greater than the difficulty of this problem but not greater than twice the difficulty of this problem. In other words, let $a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \dots, a_{i_p}$ be the difficulties of the selected problems in increasing order. Then for each $j$ from $1$ to $p-1$ $a_{i_{j + 1}} \le a_{i_j} \cdot 2$ should hold. It means that the contest consisting of only one problem is always valid.

Among all contests satisfying the condition above you have to assemble one with the maximum number of problems. Your task is to find this number of problems.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of problems in the problemset.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — difficulties of the problems. It is guaranteed that difficulties of the problems are distinct and are given in the increasing order.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — maximum number of problems in the contest satisfying the condition in the problem statement.

-----Note-----

Description of the first example: there are $10$ valid contests consisting of $1$ problem, $10$ valid contests consisting of $2$ problems ($[1, 2], [5, 6], [5, 7], [5, 10], [6, 7], [6, 10], [7, 10], [21, 23], [21, 24], [23, 24]$), $5$ valid contests consisting of $3$ problems ($[5, 6, 7], [5, 6, 10], [5, 7, 10], [6, 7, 10], [21, 23, 24]$) and a single valid contest consisting of $4$ problems ($[5, 6, 7, 10]$).

In the second example all the valid contests consist of $1$ problem.

In the third example are two contests consisting of $3$ problems: $[4, 7, 12]$ and $[100, 150, 199]$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum number of problems in a contest that can be formed from a given set of problems, subject to the condition that for each problem but the hardest one, there is a problem with a difficulty greater than the difficulty of this problem but not greater than twice the difficulty of this problem.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let $dp[i][j]$ be the maximum number of problems in a contest that can be formed from the first $i$ problems, subject to the condition that the $j$th problem is the hardest problem in the contest.

We can initialize $dp[0][0] = 0$ and $dp[i][0] = 1$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$. This is because there is only one valid contest that can be formed from the first $i$ problems, which is a contest consisting of only the first $i$ problems.

For $j = 1, 2, \ldots, n-1$, we can calculate $dp[i][j]$ as follows:

* If the $j$th problem is the hardest problem in the contest, then

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$.

Your problem is to find such pair of indices $i, j$ ($1 \le i < j \le n$) that $lcm(a_i, a_j)$ is minimum possible.

$lcm(x, y)$ is the least common multiple of $x$ and $y$ (minimum positive number such that both $x$ and $y$ are divisors of this number).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the number of elements in $a$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^7$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.


-----Output-----

Print two integers $i$ and $j$ ($1 \le i < j \le n$) such that the value of $lcm(a_i, a_j)$ is minimum among all valid pairs $i, j$. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the pair of indices $i$ and $j$ such that the least common multiple of $a_i$ and $a_j$ is minimum.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by sorting the array $a$ in non-decreasing order.

Next, we can iterate through the array $a$ and find the first pair of indices $i$ and $j$ such that $a_i$ and $a_j$ are consecutive elements. We can then calculate the least common multiple of $a_i$ and $a_j$ and store it in a variable $lcm$.

We can continue this process until we have found all the pairs of consecutive elements in the array $a$. We can then print the pair of indices $i$ and $j$ such that the least common multiple of $a_i$ and $a_j$ is minimum.

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n\log n)$ and the space complexity is $O(1)$.

You are given a string $s$ consisting of exactly $n$ characters, and each character is either '0', '1' or '2'. Such strings are called ternary strings.

Your task is to replace minimum number of characters in this string with other characters to obtain a balanced ternary string (balanced ternary string is a ternary string such that the number of characters '0' in this string is equal to the number of characters '1', and the number of characters '1' (and '0' obviously) is equal to the number of characters '2').

Among all possible balanced ternary strings you have to obtain the lexicographically (alphabetically) smallest.

Note that you can neither remove characters from the string nor add characters to the string. Also note that you can replace the given characters only with characters '0', '1' and '2'.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$, $n$ is divisible by $3$) — the number of characters in $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ consisting of exactly $n$ characters '0', '1' and '2'.


-----Output-----

Print one string — the lexicographically (alphabetically) smallest balanced ternary string which can be obtained from the given one with minimum number of replacements.

Because $n$ is divisible by $3$ it is obvious that the answer exists. And it is obvious that there is only one possible answer.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the lexicographically smallest balanced ternary string that can be obtained from a given string by replacing a minimum number of characters. The given string is guaranteed to be a ternary string, and the answer exists.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Count the number of characters '0', '1', and '2' in the given string.
2. If the number of characters '0' is not equal to the number of characters '1', then we can replace the missing characters with '0' or '1' to make the number of '0' equal to the number of '1'.
3. If the number of characters '1' is not equal to the number of characters '2', then we can replace the missing characters with '1' or '2' to make the number of '1' equal to the number of '2'.
4. If the number of characters '0' is not equal to the number of characters '2', then we can replace the missing characters with '0' or '2' to make the number of '0' equal to the number of '2'.

There is a staircase with N steps. Takahashi is now standing at the foot of the stairs, that is, on the 0-th step.
He can climb up one or two steps at a time.
However, the treads of the a_1-th, a_2-th, a_3-th, \ldots, a_M-th steps are broken, so it is dangerous to set foot on those steps.
How many are there to climb up to the top step, that is, the N-th step, without setting foot on the broken steps?
Find the count modulo 1\ 000\ 000\ 007.

-----Sample Output-----

There are four ways to climb up the stairs, as follows:
 - 0 \to 1 \to 2 \to 4 \to 5 \to 6
 - 0 \to 1 \to 2 \to 4 \to 6
 - 0 \to 2 \to 4 \to 5 \to 6
 - 0 \to 2 \to 4 \to 6

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the number of ways to climb up a staircase with N steps, where the treads of the a_1-th, a_2-th, a_3-th,..., a_M-th steps are broken. The staircase starts at the 0-th step, and the goal is to climb up to the N-th step without setting foot on the broken steps.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can define a function f(i) that represents the number of ways to climb up the staircase from the 0-th step to the i-th step, where the treads of the a_1-th, a_2-th, a_3-th,..., a_M-th steps are broken.

We can calculate f(i) using the following recurrence relation:

f(i) = f(i-1) + f(i-2)

This is because we can either climb up one step or two steps at a time, and the number of ways to climb up one step is the same as the number of ways

Takahashi, who lives on the number line, is now at coordinate X. He will make exactly K moves of distance D in the positive or negative direction.
More specifically, in one move, he can go from coordinate x to x + D or x - D.
He wants to make K moves so that the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination will be the smallest possible.
Find the minimum possible absolute value of the coordinate of the destination.

-----Constraints-----
 - -10^{15} \leq X \leq 10^{15}
 - 1 \leq K \leq 10^{15}
 - 1 \leq D \leq 10^{15}
 - All values in input are integers.

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X K D

-----Output-----
Print the minimum possible absolute value of the coordinate of the destination.

-----Sample Input-----
6 2 4

-----Sample Output-----
2

Takahashi is now at coordinate 6. It is optimal to make the following moves:
 - Move from coordinate 6 to (6 - 4 =) 2.
 - Move from coordinate 2 to (2 - 4 =) -2.
Here, the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination is 2, and we cannot make it smaller.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum absolute value of the coordinate of the destination after making K moves of distance D in the positive or negative direction.

Let's consider a few cases:

1. If X is positive, we can move X - D units to the left, and then move D units to the right to reach the destination. In this case, the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination will be D.
2. If X is negative, we can move X + D units to the right, and then move D units to the left to reach the destination. In this case, the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination will be D.
3. If X is 0, we can move D units to the left or right to reach the destination. In this case, the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination will be D.

So, the minimum absolute value of the coordinate of the destination is D.

Therefore, the solution is to move X - D units to the left or right, and then move D units to the left or right to reach the destination. The absolute value of the coordinate of the destination will be D, which is the minimum possible.

The problem is to find the number of digits in the number n.

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Divide n by 10 until n is less than or equal to 10.
2. Count the number of times we divided n by 10.
3. Return the count as the number of digits in n.

For example, if n is 11, we divide it by 10 until it is less than or equal to 10. We count the number of times we divided it by 10, which is 1. So, the number of digits in 11 is 1.

If n is 14, we divide it by 10 until it is less than or equal to 10. We count the number of times we divided it by 10, which is 1. So, the number of digits in 14 is 1.

If n is 61441, we divide it by 10 until it is less than or equal to 10. We count the number of times we divided it by 10, which is 6

The problem is to find the sum of the digits of the integer a.

To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the digits of the integer a. We can do this by converting the integer a to a string and then finding the sum of the digits of the string.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Convert the integer a to a string using the built-in function `str()`.
2. Find the sum of the digits of the string using a loop that iterates over the characters of the string. For each character, we can convert it to an integer using the built-in function `ord()` and then add it to the sum.
3. Return the sum of the digits as the final answer.

Here's an example of how this solution would work for the input 3:

1. Convert the integer 3 to a string: "3"
2. Find the sum of the digits of the string: 3 + 3 = 6
3. Return the sum of the digits as the final answer: 6

Polycarp wants to choose one type of packages and then buy several (one or more) packages of this type. What is the smallest number of packages Polycarp will have to buy to get exactly $n$ shovels?

For example, if $n=8$ and $k=7$, then Polycarp will buy $2$ packages of $4$ shovels.

 - Bulb 1 is lighted when there is an even number of switches that are "on" among the following: Switch 1 and 2.
 - Bulb 2 is lighted when there is an odd number of switches that are "on" among the following: Switch 2.
There are four possible combinations of states of (Switch 1, Switch 2): (on, on), (on, off), (off, on) and (off, off). Among them, only (on, on) lights all the bulbs, so we should print 1.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the number of combinations of "on" and "off" states of N switches that light all M bulbs. The switches are connected to bulbs in a way that a bulb is lighted when the number of switches that are "on" among the switches connected to it is congruent to the bulb's "on" state modulo 2.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of combinations of "on" and "off" states of the first i switches that light the first j bulbs. We can initialize the first row of dp with 1, since there is only one way to turn on the first bulb.

For each subsequent row, we can calculate the number of combinations of "on" and "off" states of the first i switches that light the first j bulbs as follows:

* If j = 0, we can light the first bulb with any state of the first i switches, so dp[i][0] = 2^i.

Consider an analog clock whose hour and minute hands are A and B centimeters long, respectively.
An endpoint of the hour hand and an endpoint of the minute hand are fixed at the same point, around which each hand rotates clockwise at constant angular velocity. It takes the hour and minute hands 12 hours and 1 hour to make one full rotation, respectively.
At 0 o'clock, the two hands overlap each other. H hours and M minutes later, what is the distance in centimeters between the unfixed endpoints of the hands?

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq A, B \leq 1000
 - 0 \leq H \leq 11
 - 0 \leq M \leq 59

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B H M

Print the answer without units. Your output will be accepted when its absolute or relative error from the correct value is at most 10^{-9}.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----
5.00000000000000000000

The two hands will be in the positions shown in the figure below, so the answer is 5 centimeters.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the distance between the unfixed endpoints of the hour and minute hands at a given time. The hour hand rotates clockwise at a constant angular velocity of 12 hours per rotation, while the minute hand rotates clockwise at a constant angular velocity of 1 hour per rotation.

To solve this problem, we need to find the angle between the two hands at a given time. We can do this by using the fact that the hour hand rotates 12 times faster than the minute hand. So, if the hour hand rotates 12 times in 1 hour, the minute hand rotates 1 time in 1 minute.

We can use the following formula to find the angle between the two hands:

angle = (H / 12) + (M / 1)

where H is the number of hours and M is the number of minutes.

Once we have the angle, we can use the length of the hour and minute hands to find the distance between the unfixed endpoints of the hands. We can use the following formula to find the distance:

distance = A \* sin(angle) + B \* sin(angle)

You are given an integer sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$.

Find the number of pairs of indices $(l, r)$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$) such that the value of median of $a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r$ is exactly the given number $m$.

The median of a sequence is the value of an element which is in the middle of the sequence after sorting it in non-decreasing order. If the length of the sequence is even, the left of two middle elements is used.

For example, if $a=[4, 2, 7, 5]$ then its median is $4$ since after sorting the sequence, it will look like $[2, 4, 5, 7]$ and the left of two middle elements is equal to $4$. The median of $[7, 1, 2, 9, 6]$ equals $6$ since after sorting, the value $6$ will be in the middle of the sequence.

Write a program to find the number of pairs of indices $(l, r)$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$) such that the value of median of $a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r$ is exactly the given number $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n,m \le 2\cdot10^5$) — the length of the given sequence and the required value of the median.

The second line contains an integer sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 2\cdot10^5$).

-----Note-----

In the first example, the suitable pairs of indices are: $(1, 3)$, $(1, 4)$, $(1, 5)$, $(2, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, $(2, 5)$, $(4, 5)$ and $(5, 5)$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of pairs of indices $(l, r)$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$) such that the value of median of $a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r$ is exactly the given number $m$.

To solve this problem, we can use a divide-and-conquer approach. We can divide the sequence into two parts: the first part contains all elements less than or equal to the median, and the second part contains all elements greater than the median.

We can then recursively apply this approach to each part, and count the number of pairs of indices that satisfy the condition.

The base case is when the sequence has only one element, in which case there is only one pair of indices that satisfies the condition, and the number of pairs is 1.

The time complexity of this approach is $O(n \log n)$, since we need to sort the sequence in non-decreasing order, which takes $O(n \log n)$ time.

The space complexity is $O(n)$, since we need to store the sorted sequence and the number of pairs of indices that satisfy the condition.

The only difference between easy and hard versions is a number of elements in the array.

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. The value of the $i$-th element of the array is $a_i$.

You are also given a set of $m$ segments. The $j$-th segment is $[l_j; r_j]$, where $1 \le l_j \le r_j \le n$.

You can choose some subset of the given set of segments and decrease values on each of the chosen segments by one (independently). For example, if the initial array $a = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$ and the given segments are $[1; 3]$ and $[2; 4]$ then you can choose both of them and the array will become $b = [-1, -2, -2, -1, 0]$.

You have to choose some subset of the given segments (each segment can be chosen at most once) in such a way that if you apply this subset of segments to the array $a$ and obtain the array $b$ then the value $\max\limits_{i=1}^{n}b_i - \min\limits_{i=1}^{n}b_i$ will be maximum possible.

-----Plan-----
This problem is a classic problem in dynamic programming. The idea is to find the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array after applying the segments.

We can solve this problem in two steps:

Step 1: Find the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array after applying the segments.

Step 2: Find the optimal subset of segments to apply to the array to maximize the maximum difference.

To solve Step 1, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array after applying the first j segments. We can initialize the table as follows:

dp[i][0] = a[i] - a[1]

where a[i] is the value of the i-th element of the array.

For each j from 1 to m, we can calculate dp[i][j] as follows:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], a[i] - a[j] + dp[j][j-1])

A string is called diverse if it contains consecutive (adjacent) letters of the Latin alphabet and each letter occurs exactly once. For example, the following strings are diverse: "fced", "xyz", "r" and "dabcef". The following string are not diverse: "az", "aa", "bad" and "babc". Note that the letters 'a' and 'z' are not adjacent.

Formally, consider positions of all letters in the string in the alphabet. These positions should form contiguous segment, i.e. they should come one by one without any gaps. And all letters in the string should be distinct (duplicates are not allowed).

You are given a sequence of strings. For each string, if it is diverse, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$), denoting the number of strings to process. The following $n$ lines contains strings, one string per line. Each string contains only lowercase Latin letters, its length is between $1$ and $100$, inclusive.


-----Output-----

Print $n$ lines, one line per a string in the input. The line should contain "Yes" if the corresponding string is diverse and "No" if the corresponding string is not diverse. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). For example, "YeS", "no" and "yES" are all acceptable.

Input

az
aa
bad

Output

Yes
Yes
No
No
No
No

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to check if each string is diverse or not. A string is diverse if it contains consecutive letters of the Latin alphabet and each letter occurs exactly once.

We can start by checking if the string contains consecutive letters. We can do this by checking if the letters in the string are adjacent to each other. If the letters are adjacent, we can check if they are consecutive by checking if the difference between their positions in the alphabet is equal to 1.

Next, we need to check if each letter in the string occurs exactly once. We can do this by creating a hash table where the keys are the letters in the string and the values are the counts of each letter. If the count of each letter is 1, then the letter occurs exactly once.

Finally, we can print "Yes" if the string is diverse and "No" if it is not diverse.

Here is the pseudocode for the solution:

1. Read the input string from the user.
2. Check if the string contains consecutive letters by checking if the letters are adjacent and if the difference between their positions in the alphabet is equal to 1.
3. Create a hash table where the keys are

For the recursive case, we consider all possible combinations of segments and calculate the maximum possible value of the array obtained by applying each segment. We take the maximum of these values and store it in dp[i][j].

The only difference between problems C1 and C2 is that all values in input of problem C1 are distinct (this condition may be false for problem C2).

You are given a sequence $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. All these integers are distinct, each value from $1$ to $n$ appears in the sequence exactly once.

You are making a sequence of moves. During each move you must take either the leftmost element of the sequence or the rightmost element of the sequence, write it down and remove it from the sequence. Your task is to write down a strictly increasing sequence, and among all such sequences you should take the longest (the length of the sequence is the number of elements in it).

For example, for the sequence $[2, 1, 5, 4, 3]$ the answer is $4$ (you take $2$ and the sequence becomes $[1, 5, 4, 3]$, then you take the rightmost element $3$ and the sequence becomes $[1, 5, 4]$, then you take $4$ and the sequence becomes $[1, 5]$ and then you take $5$ and the sequence becomes $[1]$, the obtained increasing sequence is $[2, 3, 4, 5]$).

In this problem, we are given a sequence of distinct integers from 1 to n, and we need to find the longest strictly increasing sequence that can be formed by taking either the leftmost or rightmost element from the sequence.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start with the first element of the sequence and add it to our sequence. Then, we can either take the leftmost or rightmost element from the remaining elements in the sequence, depending on which one is greater. We can continue this process until we have added all the elements to our sequence.

For example, let's consider the sequence [2, 1, 5, 4, 3]. We can start with the first element 2 and add it to our sequence. Then, we can either take the leftmost element 1 or the rightmost element 3, depending on which one is greater. If we take 1, our sequence becomes [2, 1], and if we take 3, our sequence becomes [2, 3]. We can continue this process until we have added all the elements to our sequence.

The longest strictly increasing sequence we can form is [2, 1,

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers.

You can remove at most one element from this array. Thus, the final length of the array is $n-1$ or $n$.

Your task is to calculate the maximum possible length of the strictly increasing contiguous subarray of the remaining array.

Recall that the contiguous subarray $a$ with indices from $l$ to $r$ is $a[l \dots r] = a_l, a_{l + 1}, \dots, a_r$. The subarray $a[l \dots r]$ is called strictly increasing if $a_l < a_{l+1} < \dots < a_r$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum length of a strictly increasing contiguous subarray of an array after removing at most one element. The subarray is defined as the contiguous sequence of elements in the array that are in strictly increasing order.

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window technique. We start with an empty window, and then iterate through the array, adding each element to the window. If the element is strictly greater than the last element in the window, we add it to the window. If the element is not strictly greater than the last element in the window, we remove the last element from the window and add the new element.

We keep track of the maximum length of the subarray in the window, and return the maximum length of the subarray at the end.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty window.
2. Iterate through the array, adding each element to the window.
3. If the element is strictly greater than the last element in the window, add it to the window.
4. If the element is not strictly greater than the last element in the window, remove the last element from the

The only difference between easy and hard versions is the number of elements in the array.

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. In one move you can choose any $a_i$ and divide it by $2$ rounding down (in other words, in one move you can set $a_i := \lfloor\frac{a_i}{2}\rfloor$).

You can perform such an operation any (possibly, zero) number of times with any $a_i$.

Your task is to calculate the minimum possible number of operations required to obtain at least $k$ equal numbers in the array.

Don't forget that it is possible to have $a_i = 0$ after some operations, thus the answer always exists.

The problem is to find the minimum number of operations required to make at least $k$ elements in the array equal. The only difference between the easy and hard versions is the number of elements in the array.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start with the first element of the array and divide it by 2, rounding down. If the result is equal to the current element, we move on to the next element. If the result is not equal to the current element, we repeat the process until we get an equal result.

We continue this process until we have at least $k$ equal elements in the array. The key insight is that we can always get an equal result by dividing the current element by 2, rounding down, as long as the result is not equal to the current element.

For example, let's say we have the array $a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ and we want to make at least 3 elements equal. We start with the first element, which is 1. We divide it by 2, rounding down, to get 0. Since 0 is not equal to

-----Output-----
Print the number of blue balls that will be there among the first N balls in the row of balls.

-----Sample Input-----
8 3 4

-----Sample Output-----
4

Let b denote a blue ball, and r denote a red ball. The first eight balls in the row will be bbbrrrrb, among which there are four blue balls.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the number of blue balls that will be among the first N balls in the row of balls made by Takahashi. The operation that Takahashi will perform is placing B red balls at the end of the row and then placing A blue balls at the end of the row.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of blue balls that will be among the first N balls in the row. We can do this by counting the number of blue balls that will be placed in the first N balls.

Let's consider the first N balls in the row. We can divide them into two parts: the first N - A balls and the last A balls. The first N - A balls will be all red balls, and the last A balls will be all blue balls.

Now, we need to find the number of blue balls that will be among the first N balls. We can do this by counting the number of blue balls that will be placed in the first N - A balls.

We know that the first N - A balls will be all red balls, so the number of blue balls that will be among the first N balls is equal to the number of blue balls that will be placed

We guessed some integer number $x$. You are given a list of almost all its divisors. Almost all means that there are all divisors except $1$ and $x$ in the list.

Your task is to find the minimum possible integer $x$ that can be the guessed number, or say that the input data is contradictory and it is impossible to find such number.

You have to answer $t$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 25$) — the number of queries. Then $t$ queries follow.

The first line of the query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 300$) — the number of divisors in the list.

The second line of the query contains $n$ integers $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$ ($2 \le d_i \le 10^6$), where $d_i$ is the $i$-th divisor of the guessed number. It is guaranteed that all values $d_i$ are distinct.


-----Output-----

For each query print the answer to it.

If the input data in the query is contradictory and it is impossible to find such number $x$ that the given list of divisors is the list of almost all its divisors, print -1. Otherwise print the minimum possible $x$.

-----Plan-----
In this problem, we are given a list of almost all the divisors of a number $x$. The list contains all divisors except $1$ and $x$. We need to find the minimum possible value of $x$.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by assuming that $x$ is the smallest possible value, i.e., $x = 2$. We can then check if the list of divisors contains all the divisors of $x$. If it does, then we know that $x$ is the correct answer. If it doesn't, then we can increment $x$ by 1 and repeat the process.

We can continue this process until we find the correct answer or until we reach a value of $x$ that is greater than the largest divisor in the list. If we reach the largest divisor in the list, then we know that the input data is contradictory and it is impossible to find such number $x$ that the given list of divisors is the list of almost all its divisors.

In the example given in the problem, we can start by assuming that $x = 2$. We can then check if the list

Petya has an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. He wants to remove duplicate (equal) elements.

Petya wants to leave only the rightmost entry (occurrence) for each element of the array. The relative order of the remaining unique elements should not be changed.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 50$) — the number of elements in Petya's array.

The following line contains a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 1\,000$) — the Petya's array.


-----Output-----

In the first line print integer $x$ — the number of elements which will be left in Petya's array after he removed the duplicates.

In the second line print $x$ integers separated with a space — Petya's array after he removed the duplicates. For each unique element only the rightmost entry should be left.

-----Note-----

In the first example you should remove two integers $1$, which are in the positions $1$ and $4$. Also you should remove the integer $5$, which is in the position $2$.

In the second example you should remove integer $2$, which is in the position $1$, and two integers $4$, which are in the positions $2$ and $4$.

In the third example you should remove four integers $6$, which are in the positions $1$, $2$, $3$ and $4$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the unique elements in the array and remove all the duplicates. We can do this by creating a hash table where the key is the element and the value is the index of the element in the array. We can then iterate through the array and for each element, check if it is already in the hash table. If it is, we remove the element from the array and update the hash table. If it is not, we add it to the hash table.

After we have removed all the duplicates, we can print the number of unique elements in the array and the unique elements in the array.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Python:
```
def remove_duplicates(arr):
    hash_table = {}
    unique_elements = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] not in hash_table:
            hash_table[arr[i]] = i
            unique_elements.append(arr[i])

Polycarp knows that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by $3$, then the number itself is divisible by $3$. He assumes that the numbers, the sum of the digits of which is divisible by $4$, are also somewhat interesting. Thus, he considers a positive integer $n$ interesting if its sum of digits is divisible by $4$.

Help Polycarp find the nearest larger or equal interesting number for the given number $a$. That is, find the interesting number $n$ such that $n \ge a$ and $n$ is minimal.


-----Input-----

The only line in the input contains an integer $a$ ($1 \le a \le 1000$).


-----Output-----

Print the nearest greater or equal interesting number for the given number $a$. In other words, print the interesting number $n$ such that $n \ge a$ and $n$ is minimal.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the nearest larger or equal interesting number for the given number $a$.

First, we need to define what an interesting number is. An interesting number is a positive integer $n$ such that the sum of its digits is divisible by $4$.

Now, let's consider the given number $a$. If $a$ is already an interesting number, then we can simply print it as the nearest larger or equal interesting number.

If $a$ is not an interesting number, we need to find the nearest larger or equal interesting number. We can do this by adding $1$ to $a$ until we get an interesting number.

For example, if $a = 432$, we can add $1$ to $432$ to get $433$, which is an interesting number. So, the nearest larger or equal interesting number for $432$ is $433$.

Similarly, if $a = 99$, we can add $1$ to $99$ to get $100$, which is an interesting number. So, the nearest larger or equal interesting number for $99

Polycarp wrote on the board a string $s$ containing only lowercase Latin letters ('a'-'z'). This string is known for you and given in the input.

After that, he erased some letters from the string $s$, and he rewrote the remaining letters in any order. As a result, he got some new string $t$. You have to find it with some additional information.

Suppose that the string $t$ has length $m$ and the characters are numbered from left to right from $1$ to $m$. You are given a sequence of $m$ integers: $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$, where $b_i$ is the sum of the distances $|i-j|$ from the index $i$ to all such indices $j$ that $t_j > t_i$ (consider that 'a'<'b'<...<'z'). In other words, to calculate $b_i$, Polycarp finds all such indices $j$ that the index $j$ contains a letter that is later in the alphabet than $t_i$ and sums all the values $|i-j|$.

For example, if $t$ = "abzb", then:  since $t_1$='a', all other indices contain letters which are later in the alphabet, that is: $b_1=|1-2|+|1-3|+|1-4|=1+2+3=6$;  since $t_2$='b', only the index $j=3$ contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is: $b_2=|2-3|=1$;  since $t_3$='z', then there are no indexes $j$ such that $t_j>t_i$, thus $b_3=0$;  since $t_4$='b', only the index $j=3$ contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is: $b_4=|4-3|=1$. 

Thus, if $t$ = "abzb", then $b=[6,1,0,1]$.

Given the string $s$ and the array $b$, find any possible string $t$ for which the following two requirements are fulfilled simultaneously:  $t$ is obtained from $s$ by erasing some letters (possibly zero) and then writing the rest in any order;  the array, constructed from the string $t$ according to the rules above, equals to the array $b$ specified in the input data. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 100$) — the number of test cases in the test. Then $q$ test cases follow.

Each test case consists of three lines:  the first line contains string $s$, which has a length from $1$ to $50$ and consists of lowercase English letters;  the second line contains positive integer $m$ ($1 \le m \le |s|$), where $|s|$ is the length of the string $s$, and $m$ is the length of the array $b$;  the third line contains the integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$ ($0 \le b_i \le 1225$). 

It is guaranteed that in each test case an answer exists.


-----Output-----

Output $q$ lines: the $k$-th of them should contain the answer (string $t$) to the $k$-th test case. It is guaranteed that an answer to each test case exists. If there are several answers, output any.

-----Note-----

In the first test case, such strings $t$ are suitable: "aac', "aab".

In the second test case, such trings $t$ are suitable: "a", "b", "c".

In the third test case, only the string $t$ equals to "aba" is suitable, but the character 'b' can be from the second or third position.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find a string $t$ that can be obtained from the given string $s$ by erasing some letters and then writing the remaining letters in any order. The additional information given is that the array $b$ constructed from the string $t$ according to the rules above is equal to the given array $b$.

To solve this problem, you can start by trying all possible strings $t$ of length $m$ that can be formed from the letters in $s$. For each string $t$, you can calculate the array $b$ constructed from $t$ according to the rules above. If the calculated array $b$ is equal to the given array $b$, then you have found a suitable string $t$.

Here is a high-level algorithm that you can use to solve this problem:

1. Start by trying all possible strings $t$ of length $m$ that can be formed from the letters in $s$.
2. For each string $t$, calculate the array $b$ constructed from $t$ according to the rules above.
3. If the calculated array $b$ is equal to the given array $b$, then you have found a suitable string $

1000000000000001 dogs suddenly appeared under the roof of Roger's house, all of which he decided to keep. The dogs had been numbered 1 through 1000000000000001, but he gave them new names, as follows:
 - the dogs numbered 1,2,\cdots,26 were respectively given the names a, b, ..., z;
 - the dogs numbered 27,28,29,\cdots,701,702  were respectively given the names aa, ab, ac, ..., zy, zz;
 - the dogs numbered 703,704,705,\cdots,18277,18278  were respectively given the names aaa, aab, aac, ..., zzy, zzz;
 - the dogs numbered 18279,18280,18281,\cdots,475253,475254  were respectively given the names aaaa, aaab, aaac, ..., zzzy, zzzz;
 - the dogs numbered 475255,475256,\cdots  were respectively given the names aaaaa, aaaab, ...;
 - and so on.
To sum it up, the dogs numbered 1, 2, \cdots were respectively given the following names:
a, b, ..., z, aa, ab, ..., az, ba, bb, ..., bz, ..., za, zb, ..., zz, aaa, aab, ..., aaz, aba, abb, ..., abz, ..., zzz, aaaa, ...
Now, Roger asks you:
"What is the name for the dog numbered N?"

-----Output-----

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the name of the dog with the given number N. We can do this by following the pattern of the names given to the dogs.

The pattern is as follows:

* The first 26 dogs were given the names a, b, c,..., z.
* The next 26 dogs were given the names aa, ab, ac,..., zy, zz.
* The next 26 dogs were given the names aaa, aab, aac,..., zzy, zzz.
* The next 26 dogs were given the names aaaa, aaab, aaaac,..., zzzz.
* And so on.

We can see that the pattern repeats every 26 dogs. So, we can find the name of the dog with the given number N by finding the number of the pattern it belongs to, and then finding the name of the dog within that pattern.

For example, if N = 2, we can find the name of the dog with N = 2 as follows:

You are given a text consisting of $n$ space-separated words. There is exactly one space character between any pair of adjacent words. There are no spaces before the first word and no spaces after the last word. The length of text is the number of letters and spaces in it. $w_i$ is the $i$-th word of text. All words consist only of lowercase Latin letters.

Let's denote a segment of words $w[i..j]$ as a sequence of words $w_i, w_{i + 1}, \dots, w_j$. Two segments of words $w[i_1 .. j_1]$ and $w[i_2 .. j_2]$ are considered equal if $j_1 - i_1 = j_2 - i_2$, $j_1 \ge i_1$, $j_2 \ge i_2$, and for every $t \in [0, j_1 - i_1]$ $w_{i_1 + t} = w_{i_2 + t}$. For example, for the text "to be or not to be" the segments $w[1..2]$ and $w[5..6]$ are equal, they correspond to the words "to be".

An abbreviation is a replacement of some segments of words with their first uppercase letters. In order to perform an abbreviation, you have to choose at least two non-intersecting equal segments of words, and replace each chosen segment with the string consisting of first letters of the words in the segment (written in uppercase). For example, for the text "a ab a a b ab a a b c" you can replace segments of words $w[2..4]$ and $w[6..8]$ with an abbreviation "AAA" and obtain the text "a AAA b AAA b c", or you can replace segments of words $w[2..5]$ and $w[6..9]$ with an abbreviation "AAAB" and obtain the text "a AAAB AAAB c".

What is the minimum length of the text after at most one abbreviation?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 300$) — the number of words in the text.

The next line contains $n$ space-separated words of the text $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$. Each word consists only of lowercase Latin letters.

It is guaranteed that the length of text does not exceed $10^5$.

Polycarp is practicing his problem solving skill. He has a list of $n$ problems with difficulties $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $k$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $n$ problems in exactly $k$ days.

Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $k$ days he will solve all the $n$ problems.

The profit of the $j$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $j$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $l$ to $r$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $\max\limits_{l \le i \le r}a_i$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $k$ days of his practice.

You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $n$ problems between $k$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.

For example, if $n = 8, k = 3$ and $a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$. Here the total profit equals $5 + 6 + 9 = 20$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 2000$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 2000$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).


-----Output-----

In the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.

In the second line print exactly $k$ positive integers $t_1, t_2, \dots, t_k$ ($t_1 + t_2 + \dots + t_k$ must equal $n$), where $t_j$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $j$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.

If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.

-----Note-----

The first example is described in the problem statement.

In the second example there is only one possible distribution.

In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$. The total profit of this distribution is $2000 + 2000 = 4000$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to distribute $n$ problems among $k$ days such that the total profit is maximized. The profit of a day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved during that day. The constraints are that each day must solve at least one problem, and the total number of problems solved must equal the total number of days.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let $dp[i][j]$ be the maximum profit for the first $i$ problems and the first $j$ days. We can compute $dp[i][j]$ as follows:

* If $j = 1$, then $dp[i][j] = a_i$.
* If $j > 1$, then $dp[i][j] = \max(dp[i-1][j-1], a_i)$.

The total profit is the maximum of all $dp[i][j]$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$ and $j = 1, 2, \ldots, k$.

To find the optimal solution, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start with the first problem and the first day

Kolya got an integer array $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. The array can contain both positive and negative integers, but Kolya doesn't like $0$, so the array doesn't contain any zeros.

Kolya doesn't like that the sum of some subsegments of his array can be $0$. The subsegment is some consecutive segment of elements of the array. 

You have to help Kolya and change his array in such a way that it doesn't contain any subsegments with the sum $0$. To reach this goal, you can insert any integers between any pair of adjacent elements of the array (integers can be really any: positive, negative, $0$, any by absolute value, even such a huge that they can't be represented in most standard programming languages).

Your task is to find the minimum number of integers you have to insert into Kolya's array in such a way that the resulting array doesn't contain any subsegments with the sum $0$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 200\,000$) — the number of elements in Kolya's array.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($-10^{9} \le a_i \le 10^{9}, a_i \neq 0$) — the description of Kolya's array.

Print the minimum number of integers you have to insert into Kolya's array in such a way that the resulting array doesn't contain any subsegments with the sum $0$.

-----Note-----

Consider the first example. There is only one subsegment with the sum $0$. It starts in the second element and ends in the fourth element. It's enough to insert one element so the array doesn't contain any subsegments with the sum equal to zero. For example, it is possible to insert the integer $1$ between second and third elements of the array.

There are no subsegments having sum $0$ in the second example so you don't need to do anything.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of integers that need to be inserted into an array of integers to make it so that no subarray has a sum of zero.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by inserting an integer between each pair of adjacent elements of the array. This will ensure that no subarray has a sum of zero.

For example, in the first example, we can insert an integer between the second and third elements of the array, and another integer between the fourth and fifth elements. This will ensure that no subarray has a sum of zero.

In the second example, we don't need to insert any integers because there are no subarrays with a sum of zero.

In the third example, we can insert an integer between the first and second elements, and another integer between the third and fourth elements. This will ensure that no subarray has a sum of zero.

In the fourth example, we can insert an integer between the first and second elements, and another integer between the third and fourth elements. This will ensure that no subarray has a sum of zero.

In the fifth example, we can insert an integer between the first

In other words, you have to maximize the sum of absolute differences between adjacent (consecutive) elements. For example, if the array $a=[1, 3, 2, 5, 5, 0]$ then the value above for this array is $|1-3| + |3-2| + |2-5| + |5-5| + |5-0| = 2 + 1 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 11$. Note that this example doesn't show the optimal answer but it shows how the required value for some array is calculated.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 10^9$) — the length of the array and its sum correspondingly.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer — the maximum possible value of $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} |a_i - a_{i+1}|$ for the array $a$ consisting of $n$ non-negative integers with the sum $m$.


-----Example-----
Input
5
1 100
2 2
5 5
2 1000000000
1000000000 1000000000

Output
0
2
10
1000000000
2000000000



-----Note-----

In the first test case of the example, the only possible array is $[100]$ and the answer is obviously $0$.

In the second test case of the example, one of the possible arrays is $[2, 0]$ and the answer is $|2-0| = 2$.

In the third test case of the example, one of the possible arrays is $[0, 2, 0, 3, 0]$ and the answer is $|0-2| + |2-0| + |0-3| + |3-0| = 10$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in an array of length $n$ with a given sum $m$.

We can start by considering the case where the array consists of only one element. In this case, the sum of absolute differences is zero, which is the maximum possible value.

Now, let's consider the case where the array consists of more than one element. We can divide the array into two parts: the first part consists of $n-1$ elements, and the second part consists of one element. The sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the first part is zero, since the elements are consecutive. The sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the second part is also zero, since there is only one element in this part.

Therefore, the maximum possible value of the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in an array of length $n$ with a given sum $m$ is the maximum of the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the first part and the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the second part.

We can find the maximum value of the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the first part by

Takahashi loves the number 7 and multiples of K.
Where is the first occurrence of a multiple of K in the sequence 7,77,777,\ldots? (Also see Output and Sample Input/Output below.)
If the sequence contains no multiples of K, print -1 instead.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq K \leq 10^6
 - K is an integer.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
K

-----Output-----
Print an integer representing the position of the first occurrence of a multiple of K. (For example, if the first occurrence is the fourth element of the sequence, print 4.)

-----Sample Input-----
101

-----Sample Output-----
4

None of 7, 77, and 777 is a multiple of 101, but 7777 is.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the first occurrence of a multiple of K in the sequence 7, 77, 777,.... We can do this by using a loop that iterates through the sequence and checks if each element is a multiple of K. If we find a multiple, we can print the position of that element and exit the loop. If we don't find a multiple, we can print -1.

Here's an example of how this could be implemented in Python:
```
def find_first_multiple(k, sequence):
    for i, element in enumerate(sequence):
        if element % k == 0:
            return i
    return -1

You are given a permutation $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$. A permutation of length $n$ is a sequence such that each integer between $1$ and $n$ occurs exactly once in the sequence.

Find the number of pairs of indices $(l, r)$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$) such that the value of the median of $p_l, p_{l+1}, \dots, p_r$ is exactly the given number $m$.

The median of a sequence is the value of the element which is in the middle of the sequence after sorting it in non-decreasing order. If the length of the sequence is even, the left of two middle elements is used.

For example, if $a=[4, 2, 7, 5]$ then its median is $4$ since after sorting the sequence, it will look like $[2, 4, 5, 7]$ and the left of two middle elements is equal to $4$. The median of $[7, 1, 2, 9, 6]$ equals $6$ since after sorting, the value $6$ will be in the middle of the sequence.

Write a program to find the number of pairs of indices $(l, r)$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$) such that the value of the median of $p_l, p_{l+1}, \dots, p_r$ is exactly the given number $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5$, $1 \le m \le n$) — the length of the given sequence and the required value of the median.

The second line contains a permutation $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$). Each integer between $1$ and $n$ occurs in $p$ exactly once.

-----Note-----

In the first example, the suitable pairs of indices are: $(1, 3)$, $(2, 2)$, $(2, 3)$ and $(2, 4)$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pairs of indices $(l, r)$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$) such that the value of the median of $p_l, p_{l+1}, \dots, p_r$ is exactly the given number $m$.

We can solve this problem using a divide and conquer approach. We can divide the sequence into two parts: the first part contains the elements $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_l$ and the second part contains the elements $p_{l+1}, p_{l+2}, \dots, p_n$.

We can then find the median of each part separately and compare it with the given number $m$. If the median of the first part is less than $m$, then we can discard the first part and focus on the second part. If the median of the second part is less than $m$, then we can discard the second part and focus on the first part.

We can repeat this process until we find the median of the remaining part, which is the median of the entire sequence. If the median of the entire sequence is equal to $m$,

The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraints.

Polycarp has to write a coursework. The coursework consists of $m$ pages.

Polycarp also has $n$ cups of coffee. The coffee in the $i$-th cup has $a_i$ caffeine in it. Polycarp can drink some cups of coffee (each one no more than once). He can drink cups in any order. Polycarp drinks each cup instantly and completely (i.e. he cannot split any cup into several days).

Surely, courseworks are not usually being written in a single day (in a perfect world of Berland, at least). Some of them require multiple days of hard work.

Let's consider some day of Polycarp's work. Consider Polycarp drinks $k$ cups of coffee during this day and caffeine dosages of cups Polycarp drink during this day are $a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \dots, a_{i_k}$. Then the first cup he drinks gives him energy to write $a_{i_1}$ pages of coursework, the second cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_2} - 1)$ pages, the third cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_3} - 2)$ pages, ..., the $k$-th cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_k} - k + 1)$ pages.

If Polycarp doesn't drink coffee during some day, he cannot write coursework at all that day.

Polycarp has to finish his coursework as soon as possible (spend the minimum number of days to do it). Your task is to find out this number of days or say that it is impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $1 \le m \le 10^4$) — the number of cups of coffee and the number of pages in the coursework.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$), where $a_i$ is the caffeine dosage of coffee in the $i$-th cup.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to write the coursework, print -1. Otherwise print the minimum number of days Polycarp needs to do it.

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can drink fourth cup during first day (and write $1$ page), first and second cups during second day (and write $2 + (3 - 1) = 4$ pages), fifth cup during the third day (and write $2$ pages) and third cup during the fourth day (and write $1$ page) so the answer is $4$. It is obvious that there is no way to write the coursework in three or less days in this test.

In the second example Polycarp can drink third, fourth and second cups during first day (and write $4 + (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 6$ pages) and sixth cup during second day (and write $4$ pages) so the answer is $2$. It is obvious that Polycarp cannot write the whole coursework in one day in this test.

In the third example Polycarp can drink all cups of coffee during first day and write $5 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 2) + (5 - 3) + (5 - 4) = 15$ pages of coursework.

In the fourth example Polycarp cannot drink all cups during first day and should drink one of them during the second day. So during first day he will write $5 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 2) + (5 - 3) = 14$ pages of coursework and during second day he will write $5$ pages of coursework. This is enough to complete it.

In the fifth example Polycarp cannot write the whole coursework at all, even if he will drink one cup of coffee during each day, so the answer is -1.

-----Plan-----
This problem is a classic problem in dynamic programming. The idea is to find the minimum number of days it takes to write the coursework by considering all possible combinations of cups of coffee that Polycarp can drink.

Let's consider the case where Polycarp drinks $k$ cups of coffee during a day. The number of pages he can write during that day is given by the formula:

$$\text{pages} = \sum_{i=1}^k \max(0, a_i - i + 1)$$

where $a_i$ is the caffeine dosage in the $i$th cup of coffee.

Now, let's consider the case where Polycarp drinks $k$ cups of coffee during $d$ days. The number of pages he can write during the $d$ days is given by the formula:

$$\text{pages} = \sum_{i=1}^d \sum_{j=1}^k \max(0, a_{ij} - j + 1)$$

where $a_{ij}$ is the caffeine dosage in the $i$th cup of coffee

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
Polycarp likes arithmetic progressions. A sequence $[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]$ is called an arithmetic progression if for each $i$ ($1 \le i < n$) the value $a_{i+1} - a_i$ is the same. For example, the sequences $[42]$, $[5, 5, 5]$, $[2, 11, 20, 29]$ and $[3, 2, 1, 0]$ are arithmetic progressions, but $[1, 0, 1]$, $[1, 3, 9]$ and $[2, 3, 1]$ are not.

It follows from the definition that any sequence of length one or two is an arithmetic progression.

Polycarp found some sequence of positive integers $[b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n]$. He agrees to change each element by at most one. In the other words, for each element there are exactly three options: an element can be decreased by $1$, an element can be increased by $1$, an element can be left unchanged.

Determine a minimum possible number of elements in $b$ which can be changed (by exactly one), so that the sequence $b$ becomes an arithmetic progression, or report that it is impossible.

It is possible that the resulting sequence contains element equals $0$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \le n \le 100\,000)$ — the number of elements in $b$.

The second line contains a sequence $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$ $(1 \le b_i \le 10^{9})$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make an arithmetic progression with described operations, print -1. In the other case, print non-negative integer — the minimum number of elements to change to make the given sequence becomes an arithmetic progression. The only allowed operation is to add/to subtract one from an element (can't use operation twice to the same position).


-----Examples-----
Input

Output
0

Input
3
14 5 1

Output

Input

1 3 6 9 12

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp should increase the first number on $1$, decrease the second number on $1$, increase the third number on $1$, and the fourth number should left unchanged. So, after Polycarp changed three elements by one, his sequence became equals to $[25, 20, 15, 10]$, which is an arithmetic progression.

In the second example Polycarp should not change anything, because his sequence is an arithmetic progression.

In the third example it is impossible to make an arithmetic progression.

In the fourth example Polycarp should change only the first element, he should decrease it on one. After that his sequence will looks like $[0, 3, 6, 9, 12]$, which is an arithmetic progression.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of elements in a sequence that can be changed (by exactly one) to make the sequence an arithmetic progression. The only allowed operation is to add/to subtract one from an element (can't use operation twice to the same position).

To solve this problem, we need to find the longest arithmetic progression in the given sequence. We can do this by finding the longest subsequence of the sequence that is an arithmetic progression.

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We can create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of elements to change in the first i elements of the sequence to make the first i elements an arithmetic progression. We can initialize the first row of the array with the values 0, 1, 2,..., n-1, where n is the length of the sequence.

We can then fill in the rest of the array using the following recurrence relation:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j+1]) + 1

You are a coach at your local university. There are $n$ students under your supervision, the programming skill of the $i$-th student is $a_i$.

You have to form $k$ teams for yet another new programming competition. As you know, the more students are involved in competition the more probable the victory of your university is! So you have to form no more than $k$ (and at least one) non-empty teams so that the total number of students in them is maximized. But you also know that each team should be balanced. It means that the programming skill of each pair of students in each team should differ by no more than $5$. Teams are independent from one another (it means that the difference between programming skills of two students from two different teams does not matter).

It is possible that some students not be included in any team at all.

Your task is to report the maximum possible total number of students in no more than $k$ (and at least one) non-empty balanced teams.

If you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 5000$) — the number of students and the maximum number of teams, correspondingly.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is a programming skill of the $i$-th student.


-----Output-----

Output

-----Plan-----
This problem can be solved using a combination of greedy and dynamic programming techniques.

The greedy approach is to form teams of students with the highest programming skills first, and then balance the teams by adding students with lower programming skills. This approach is optimal because it maximizes the total number of students in the teams while also ensuring that the teams are balanced.

The dynamic programming approach is to consider all possible combinations of teams and their sizes, and then find the maximum total number of students in the teams that satisfy the constraints. This approach is optimal because it considers all possible combinations of teams and their sizes, and it finds the maximum total number of students in the teams that satisfy the constraints.

To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we need to define a two-dimensional array dp of size (n+1) x (k+1), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum total number of students in no more than j non-empty balanced teams of size i or less.

We can initialize the first row of the dp array as follows:

dp[1][1] = 1 (since we can form a team of size 1 with the only student)

The problem is asking us to find the minimum number of points Takahashi needs to score on the final subject to achieve his goal of having an average score of M points or above on N subjects.

We need to find the minimum number of points Takahashi needs to score on the final subject to achieve his goal.

2. Calculate the average score Takahashi has achieved so far by dividing the total score by the number of subjects he has taken.
3. Calculate the difference between the desired average score M and the average score Takahashi has achieved so far.

Takahashi has decided to hold fastest-finger-fast quiz games. Kizahashi, who is in charge of making the scoreboard, is struggling to write the program that manages the players' scores in a game, which proceeds as follows.
A game is played by N players, numbered 1 to N. At the beginning of a game, each player has K points.
When a player correctly answers a question, each of the other N-1 players receives minus one (-1) point. There is no other factor that affects the players' scores.
At the end of a game, the players with 0 points or lower are eliminated, and the remaining players survive.
In the last game, the players gave a total of Q correct answers, the i-th of which was given by Player A_i.
For Kizahashi, write a program that determines whether each of the N players survived this game.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq K \leq 10^9

In the beginning, the players' scores are (3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3).
 - Player 3 correctly answers a question. The players' scores are now (2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2).
 - Player 1 correctly answers a question. The players' scores are now (2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1).
 - Player 3 correctly answers a question. The players' scores are now (1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0).
 - Player 2 correctly answers a question. The players' scores are now (0, 0, 1, -1, -1, -1).
Players 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, who have 0 points or lower, are eliminated, and Player 3 survives this game.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the scores of each player during the game. We can do this by using an array of size N, where each element represents the score of a player.

At the beginning of the game, we initialize the scores of all players to K.

Then, for each question that is answered correctly, we decrease the scores of all players except the one who answered the question by 1.

Finally, at the end of the game, we check if each player has a score of 0 or lower. If a player has a score of 0 or lower, we print "No" for that player. Otherwise, we print "Yes".

Here is the pseudocode for the solution:

1. Initialize an array scores of size N, where each element is initialized to K.
2. For each question that is answered correctly:
	* Decrease the scores of all players except the one who answered the question by 1.
3. For each player:
	* If the player's score is 0 or lower, print "No" for that player.
	* Otherwise, print "Yes" for that player.

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
You are given a binary matrix $a$ of size $n \times m$. A binary matrix is a matrix where each element is either $0$ or $1$.

You may perform some (possibly zero) operations with this matrix. During each operation you can inverse the row of this matrix or a column of this matrix. Formally, inverting a row is changing all values in this row to the opposite ($0$ to $1$, $1$ to $0$). Inverting a column is changing all values in this column to the opposite.

Your task is to sort the initial matrix by some sequence of such operations. The matrix is considered sorted if the array $[a_{1, 1}, a_{1, 2}, \dots, a_{1, m}, a_{2, 1}, a_{2, 2}, \dots, a_{2, m}, \dots, a_{n, m - 1}, a_{n, m}]$ is sorted in non-descending order.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 200$) — the number of rows and the number of columns in the matrix.

The next $n$ lines contain $m$ integers each. The $j$-th element in the $i$-th line is $a_{i, j}$ ($0 \le a_{i, j} \le 1$) — the element of $a$ at position $(i, j)$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to obtain a sorted matrix, print "NO" in the first line.

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. In the second line print a string $r$ of length $n$. The $i$-th character $r_i$ of this string should be '1' if the $i$-th row of the matrix is inverted and '0' otherwise. In the third line print a string $c$ of length $m$. The $j$-th character $c_j$ of this string should be '1' if the $j$-th column of the matrix is inverted and '0' otherwise. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

The problem is to sort a binary matrix by some sequence of row and column inversions. The matrix is considered sorted if the array $[a_{1, 1}, a_{1, 2}, \dots, a_{1, m}, a_{2, 1}, a_{2, 2}, \dots, a_{2, m}, \dots, a_{n, m - 1}, a_{n, m}]$ is sorted in non-descending order.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by sorting the rows of the matrix in non-descending order. We then sort the columns of the matrix in non-descending order.

To sort the rows, we can use a simple algorithm. We start by considering the first row of the matrix. We then compare the first element of this row with the first element of the second row. If the first element of the first row is less than or equal to the first element of the second row, we do nothing. Otherwise, we invert the first row. We then consider the second row and compare the first element of this row with the first element of the third row. If the first element of the second row

-----Plan-----
The problem is to determine whether a given string of digits can be rearranged to form a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or number that reads the same backward as it does forward.

To solve this problem, we can start by checking if the string is already a palindrome. If it is, we can output "Yes". If it is not, we can continue to the next step.

Next, we can reverse the string and check if it is a palindrome. If it is, we can output "Yes". If it is not, we can continue to the next step.

Finally, we can check if the original string and the reversed string are anagrams. If they are, we can output "Yes". If they are not, we can output "No".

Overall, the solution to this problem is to check if the string is a palindrome, if it is not, check if it is an anagram of its reverse, and if it is not, output "No".

There is a robot staying at $X=0$ on the $Ox$ axis. He has to walk to $X=n$. You are controlling this robot and controlling how he goes. The robot has a battery and an accumulator with a solar panel.

The $i$-th segment of the path (from $X=i-1$ to $X=i$) can be exposed to sunlight or not. The array $s$ denotes which segments are exposed to sunlight: if segment $i$ is exposed, then $s_i = 1$, otherwise $s_i = 0$.

The robot has one battery of capacity $b$ and one accumulator of capacity $a$. For each segment, you should choose which type of energy storage robot will use to go to the next point (it can be either battery or accumulator). If the robot goes using the battery, the current charge of the battery is decreased by one (the robot can't use the battery if its charge is zero). And if the robot goes using the accumulator, the current charge of the accumulator is decreased by one (and the robot also can't use the accumulator if its charge is zero).

If the current segment is exposed to sunlight and the robot goes through it using the battery, the charge of the accumulator increases by one (of course, its charge can't become higher than it's maximum capacity).

If accumulator is used to pass some segment, its charge decreases by 1 no matter if the segment is exposed or not.

You understand that it is not always possible to walk to $X=n$. You want your robot to go as far as possible. Find the maximum number of segments of distance the robot can pass if you control him optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n, b, a$ ($1 \le n, b, a \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the robot's destination point, the battery capacity and the accumulator capacity, respectively.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ ($0 \le s_i \le 1$), where $s_i$ is $1$ if the $i$-th segment of distance is exposed to sunlight, and $0$ otherwise.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the maximum number of segments the robot can pass if you control him optimally.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 1
0 1 0 1 0

Output
5

Input
6 2 1
1 0 0 1 0 1

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example the robot can go through the first segment using the accumulator, and charge levels become $b=2$ and $a=0$. The second segment can be passed using the battery, and charge levels become $b=1$ and $a=1$. The third segment can be passed using the accumulator, and charge levels become $b=1$ and $a=0$. The fourth segment can be passed using the battery, and charge levels become $b=0$ and $a=1$. And the fifth segment can be passed using the accumulator.

In the second example the robot can go through the maximum number of segments using battery two times and accumulator one time in any order.

-----Plan-----
This problem is a classic problem in dynamic programming. The idea is to keep track of the maximum number of segments that the robot can pass using the battery and the accumulator at each point in the path.

Let dp[i] be the maximum number of segments that the robot can pass using the battery and the accumulator at the point i in the path. Then, we can define the following recurrence relation:

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + 1, dp[i-2] + 1) if s[i] = 0
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + 1) if s[i] = 1

The first equation states that if the current segment is not exposed to sunlight, then the robot can pass one more segment using the battery and the accumulator. The second equation states that if the current segment is exposed to sunlight, then the robot can pass one more segment using the accumulator.

The base case is dp[0] = 0 and dp[1] = 1.

The maximum number of segments that the robot can pass

-----Plan-----
The problem writer has provided an arithmetic expression as input, and the task is to evaluate the expression and return the result. However, the reference solution has a bug, which is causing the result to be incorrect.

To solve this problem, we need to identify the bug in the reference solution and fix it. The bug is that the solution is not handling the minus sign correctly. When the minus sign is encountered, it is being treated as an addition operation instead of a subtraction operation.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to handle the minus sign correctly. One way to do this is to check if the current operand is negative, and if so, subtract it from the result instead of adding it. Here is the modified code:
```
result = 0
for operand in expression:
    if operand < 0:
        result -= operand
    else:
        result += operand
return result
```
With this modification, the bug is fixed, and the correct result is returned for all input expressions.

The king of Berland organizes a ball! $n$ pair are invited to the ball, they are numbered from $1$ to $n$. Each pair consists of one man and one woman. Each dancer (either man or woman) has a monochrome costume. The color of each costume is represented by an integer from $1$ to $k$, inclusive.

Let $b_i$ be the color of the man's costume and $g_i$ be the color of the woman's costume in the $i$-th pair. You have to choose a color for each dancer's costume (i.e. values $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$ and $g_1, g_2, \dots g_n$) in such a way that:  for every $i$: $b_i$ and $g_i$ are integers between $1$ and $k$, inclusive;  there are no two completely identical pairs, i.e. no two indices $i, j$ ($i \ne j$) such that $b_i = b_j$ and $g_i = g_j$ at the same time;  there is no pair such that the color of the man's costume is the same as the color of the woman's costume in this pair, i.e. $b_i \ne g_i$ for every $i$;  for each two consecutive (adjacent) pairs both man's costume colors and woman's costume colors differ, i.e. for every $i$ from $1$ to $n-1$ the conditions $b_i \ne b_{i + 1}$ and $g_i \ne g_{i + 1}$ hold. 

Let's take a look at the examples of bad and good color choosing (for $n=4$ and $k=3$, man is the first in a pair and woman is the second):

Bad color choosing:   $(1, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 2)$, $(1, 2)$ — contradiction with the second rule (there are equal pairs);  $(2, 3)$, $(1, 1)$, $(3, 2)$, $(1, 3)$ — contradiction with the third rule (there is a pair with costumes of the same color);  $(1, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, $(1, 3)$, $(2, 1)$ — contradiction with the fourth rule (there are two consecutive pairs such that colors of costumes of men/women are the same). 

Good color choosing:   $(1, 2)$, $(2, 1)$, $(1, 3)$, $(3, 1)$;  $(1, 2)$, $(3, 1)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 2)$;  $(3, 1)$, $(1, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 2)$. 

You have to find any suitable color choosing or say that no suitable choosing exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \le n, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of pairs and the number of colors.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to find any suitable colors choosing, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" and then the colors of the costumes of pairs in the next $n$ lines. The $i$-th line should contain two integers $b_i$ and $g_i$ — colors of costumes of man and woman in the $i$-th pair, respectively.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). For example, "YeS", "no" and "yES" are all acceptable.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find a suitable color choosing for the ball, where each dancer has a monochrome costume. The color of each costume is represented by an integer from 1 to k, inclusive. The color choosing should satisfy the following conditions:

1. Each dancer has a unique color for their costume.
2. There are no two completely identical pairs.
3. There is no pair such that the color of the man's costume is the same as the color of the woman's costume in this pair.
4. For each two consecutive (adjacent) pairs, both man's costume colors and woman's costume colors differ.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We can start by assigning colors to the men and women in the pairs in a way that satisfies condition 1. Then, we can assign colors to the remaining dancers in a way that satisfies conditions 2, 3, and 4.

Here is an example of a suitable color choosing for the ball with 4 pairs and 4 colors:

The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraints.

Vova likes pictures with kittens. The news feed in the social network he uses can be represented as an array of $n$ consecutive pictures (with kittens, of course). Vova likes all these pictures, but some are more beautiful than the others: the $i$-th picture has beauty $a_i$.

Vova wants to repost exactly $x$ pictures in such a way that:   each segment of the news feed of at least $k$ consecutive pictures has at least one picture reposted by Vova;  the sum of beauty values of reposted pictures is maximum possible. 

For example, if $k=1$ then Vova has to repost all the pictures in the news feed. If $k=2$ then Vova can skip some pictures, but between every pair of consecutive pictures Vova has to repost at least one of them.

Your task is to calculate the maximum possible sum of values of reposted pictures if Vova follows conditions described above, or say that there is no way to satisfy all conditions.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n, k$ and $x$ ($1 \le k, x \le n \le 200$) — the number of pictures in the news feed, the minimum length of segment with at least one repost in it and the number of pictures Vova is ready to repost.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the beauty of the $i$-th picture.


-----Output-----

Print -1 if there is no way to repost some pictures to satisfy all the conditions in the problem statement.

-----Plan-----
The problem can be solved by finding the maximum sum of beauty values of reposted pictures that satisfy the conditions.

The key insight is that the maximum sum of beauty values of reposted pictures is equal to the maximum sum of beauty values of all pictures in the news feed, minus the minimum beauty value of all pictures in the news feed.

To find the maximum sum of beauty values of all pictures in the news feed, we can sort the array of beauty values in non-decreasing order and then sum up the beauty values of the first $x$ pictures.

To find the minimum beauty value of all pictures in the news feed, we can find the minimum value in the array of beauty values.

Therefore, the maximum sum of beauty values of reposted pictures is equal to the maximum sum of beauty values of all pictures in the news feed, minus the minimum beauty value of all pictures in the news feed.

To find the maximum sum of beauty values of all pictures in the news feed, we can sort the array of beauty values in non-decreasing order and then sum up the beauty values of the first $x$ pictures.

You work as a system administrator in a dormitory, which has $n$ rooms one after another along a straight hallway. Rooms are numbered from $1$ to $n$.

You have to connect all $n$ rooms to the Internet.

You can connect each room to the Internet directly, the cost of such connection for the $i$-th room is $i$ coins. 

Some rooms also have a spot for a router. The cost of placing a router in the $i$-th room is also $i$ coins. You cannot place a router in a room which does not have a spot for it. When you place a router in the room $i$, you connect all rooms with the numbers from $max(1,~i - k)$ to $min(n,~i + k)$ inclusive to the Internet, where $k$ is the range of router. The value of $k$ is the same for all routers. 

Calculate the minimum total cost of connecting all $n$ rooms to the Internet. You can assume that the number of rooms which have a spot for a router is not greater than the number of routers you have.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of rooms and the range of each router.

The second line of the input contains one string $s$ of length $n$, consisting only of zeros and ones. If the $i$-th character of the string equals to '1' then there is a spot for a router in the $i$-th room. If the $i$-th character of the string equals to '0' then you cannot place a router in the $i$-th room.

-----Note-----

In the first example it is enough to place the router in the room $3$, then all rooms will be connected to the Internet. The total cost of connection is $3$.

In the second example you can place routers nowhere, so you need to connect all rooms directly. Thus, the total cost of connection of all rooms is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$.

In the third example you need to connect the room $1$ directly and place the router in the room $3$. Thus, the total cost of connection of all rooms is $1 + 3 = 4$.

In the fourth example you need to place routers in rooms $5$ and $10$. Then all rooms will be connected to the Internet. The total cost of connection is $5 + 10 = 15$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum cost of connecting all $n$ rooms to the Internet. We can do this by connecting each room directly to the Internet, which costs $i$ coins for the $i$-th room. However, we can also connect some rooms to the Internet using routers, which costs $i$ coins for the $i$-th room.

We can place a router in a room if there is a spot for a router in that room. The cost of placing a router in the $i$-th room is $i$ coins. We can place a router in a room if there is a spot for a router in that room.

We can connect all rooms with the numbers from $max(1,~i - k)$ to $min(n,~i + k)$ inclusive to the Internet, where $k$ is the range of router. The value of $k$ is the same for all routers.

To find the minimum total cost of connecting all $n$ rooms to the Internet, we need to find the minimum cost of connecting each room directly to the Internet and the minimum cost of connecting each room using a router. We can then add

The problem is to determine if two strings, S and T, can be made equal by performing a specific operation on the string S. The operation is to replace every occurrence of two distinct lowercase English letters, c_1 and c_2, with each other. The goal is to determine if S and T can be made equal by performing the operation zero or more times.

To solve this problem, we can use a technique called "two-pointer" or "sliding window" algorithm. The basic idea is to maintain two pointers, one for S and one for T, and move them in tandem. At each step, we compare the characters at the two pointers and if they are the same, we move both pointers forward. If they are not the same, we move the pointer for S forward and then move the pointer for T forward.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Initialize two pointers, i and j, to the beginning of the strings S and T.
2. While i < |S| and j < |T|, do the following:

A programming competition site AtCode provides algorithmic problems.
Each problem is allocated a score based on its difficulty.
Currently, for each integer i between 1 and D (inclusive), there are p_i problems with a score of 100i points.
These p_1 + … + p_D problems are all of the problems available on AtCode.
A user of AtCode has a value called total score.
The total score of a user is the sum of the following two elements:
 - Base score: the sum of the scores of all problems solved by the user.
 - Perfect bonuses: when a user solves all problems with a score of 100i points, he/she earns the perfect bonus of c_i points, aside from the base score (1 ≤ i ≤ D).
Takahashi, who is the new user of AtCode, has not solved any problem.
His objective is to have a total score of G or more points.
At least how many problems does he need to solve for this objective?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 ≤ D ≤ 10
 - 1 ≤ p_i ≤ 100
 - 100 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^6
 - 100 ≤ G
 - All values in input are integers.
 - c_i and G are all multiples of 100.
 - It is possible to have a total score of G or more points.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
D G
p_1 c_1
:
p_D c_D

-----Output-----
Print the minimum number of problems that needs to be solved in order to have a total score of G or more points. Note that this objective is always achievable (see Constraints).

-----Sample Input-----
2 700
3 500
5 800

-----Sample Output-----
3

In this case, there are three problems each with 100 points and five problems each with 200 points. The perfect bonus for solving all the 100-point problems is 500 points, and the perfect bonus for solving all the 200-point problems is 800 points. Takahashi's objective is to have a total score of 700 points or more.
One way to achieve this objective is to solve four 200-point problems and earn a base score of 800 points. However, if we solve three 100-point problems, we can earn the perfect bonus of 500 points in addition to the base score of 300 points, for a total score of 800 points, and we can achieve the objective with fewer problems.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of problems that Takahashi needs to solve to have a total score of G or more points.

We know that the total score of Takahashi is the sum of the base score and the perfect bonuses. The base score is the sum of the scores of all the problems solved by Takahashi, and the perfect bonuses are the points earned when Takahashi solves all the problems with a score of 100i points for each i between 1 and D.

We also know that the total score of Takahashi is at least G points.

Let's first consider the base score. The base score is the sum of the scores of all the problems solved by Takahashi, and the number of problems solved by Takahashi is the number of problems with a score of 100i points for each i between 1 and D.

We can calculate the base score as follows:

Base score = ∑i=1^D (p_i)

We also know that the total score of Takahashi is at least G points.

So, we can write an equation for the base score

Tanya has $n$ candies numbered from $1$ to $n$. The $i$-th candy has the weight $a_i$.

She plans to eat exactly $n-1$ candies and give the remaining candy to her dad. Tanya eats candies in order of increasing their numbers, exactly one candy per day.

Your task is to find the number of such candies $i$ (let's call these candies good) that if dad gets the $i$-th candy then the sum of weights of candies Tanya eats in even days will be equal to the sum of weights of candies Tanya eats in odd days. Note that at first, she will give the candy, after it she will eat the remaining candies one by one.

For example, $n=4$ and weights are $[1, 4, 3, 3]$. Consider all possible cases to give a candy to dad:  Tanya gives the $1$-st candy to dad ($a_1=1$), the remaining candies are $[4, 3, 3]$. She will eat $a_2=4$ in the first day, $a_3=3$ in the second day, $a_4=3$ in the third day. So in odd days she will eat $4+3=7$ and in even days she will eat $3$. Since $7 \ne 3$ this case shouldn't be counted to the answer (this candy isn't good).  Tanya gives the $2$-nd candy to dad ($a_2=4$), the remaining candies are $[1, 3, 3]$. She will eat $a_1=1$ in the first day, $a_3=3$ in the second day, $a_4=3$ in the third day. So in odd days she will eat $1+3=4$ and in even days she will eat $3$. Since $4 \ne 3$ this case shouldn't be counted to the answer (this candy isn't good).  Tanya gives the $3$-rd candy to dad ($a_3=3$), the remaining candies are $[1, 4, 3]$. She will eat $a_1=1$ in the first day, $a_2=4$ in the second day, $a_4=3$ in the third day. So in odd days she will eat $1+3=4$ and in even days she will eat $4$. Since $4 = 4$ this case should be counted to the answer (this candy is good).  Tanya gives the $4$-th candy to dad ($a_4=3$), the remaining candies are $[1, 4, 3]$. She will eat $a_1=1$ in the first day, $a_2=4$ in the second day, $a_3=3$ in the third day. So in odd days she will eat $1+3=4$ and in even days she will eat $4$. Since $4 = 4$ this case should be counted to the answer (this candy is good). 

In total there $2$ cases which should counted (these candies are good), so the answer is $2$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of candies.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^4$), where $a_i$ is the weight of the $i$-th candy.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of such candies $i$ (good candies) that if dad gets the $i$-th candy then the sum of weights of candies Tanya eats in even days will be equal to the sum of weights of candies Tanya eats in odd days.

-----Note-----

In the first example indices of good candies are $[1, 2]$.

In the second example indices of good candies are $[2, 3]$.

In the third example indices of good candies are $[4, 5, 9]$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of candies that, if given to dad, will make Tanya eat the same number of candies in even and odd days.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candies that have the same weight in both even and odd days.

Let's consider the case where Tanya eats candies in order of increasing their numbers, exactly one candy per day.

If Tanya eats the $i$-th candy in an even day, then she will eat the remaining candies in the order of their weights, starting from the smallest weight. If she eats the $i$-th candy in an odd day, then she will eat the remaining candies in the order of their weights, starting from the largest weight.

Therefore, if Tanya eats the $i$-th candy in an even day, then the sum of weights of candies she eats in even days will be equal to the sum of weights of candies she eats in odd days if and only if the $i$-th candy has the same weight in both even and odd days.

So, we need to find the number of

The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraints.

Vova likes pictures with kittens. The news feed in the social network he uses can be represented as an array of $n$ consecutive pictures (with kittens, of course). Vova likes all these pictures, but some are more beautiful than the others: the $i$-th picture has beauty $a_i$.

Vova wants to repost exactly $x$ pictures in such a way that:   each segment of the news feed of at least $k$ consecutive pictures has at least one picture reposted by Vova;  the sum of beauty values of reposted pictures is maximum possible. 

For example, if $k=1$ then Vova has to repost all the pictures in the news feed. If $k=2$ then Vova can skip some pictures, but between every pair of consecutive pictures Vova has to repost at least one of them.

Your task is to calculate the maximum possible sum of values of reposted pictures if Vova follows conditions described above, or say that there is no way to satisfy all conditions.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n, k$ and $x$ ($1 \le k, x \le n \le 5000$) — the number of pictures in the news feed, the minimum length of segment with at least one repost in it and the number of pictures Vova is ready to repost.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the beauty of the $i$-th picture.


-----Output-----

Print -1 if there is no way to repost some pictures to satisfy all the conditions in the problem statement.

Otherwise print one integer — the maximum sum of values of reposted pictures if Vova follows conditions described in the problem statement.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

18

6 1 5
10 30 30 70 10 10

Output
-1

Input
4 3 1
1 100 1 1

Output
100

-----Plan-----
The problem can be solved by finding the maximum sum of beauty values of reposted pictures that satisfy the conditions.

The key insight is that the maximum sum of beauty values of reposted pictures is equal to the maximum sum of beauty values of all pictures in the news feed, minus the minimum beauty value of all pictures in the news feed.

To find the maximum sum of beauty values of all pictures in the news feed, we can sort the array of beauty values in non-decreasing order and then sum up the beauty values of the first $x$ pictures.

To find the minimum beauty value of all pictures in the news feed, we can find the minimum beauty value of the first $k$ pictures.

Therefore, the maximum sum of beauty values of reposted pictures is equal to the sum of beauty values of the first $x$ pictures minus the minimum beauty value of the first $k$ pictures.

To find the maximum sum of beauty values of the first $x$ pictures, we can find the maximum sum of beauty values of the first $x$ pictures in the sorted array of beauty values.

To find the minimum beauty value of the first $k$ pictures, we can find

La Confiserie d'ABC sells cakes at 4 dollars each and doughnuts at 7 dollars each.
Determine if there is a way to buy some of them for exactly N dollars. You can buy two or more doughnuts and two or more cakes, and you can also choose to buy zero doughnuts or zero cakes.

-----Constraints-----
 - N is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

-----Output-----
If there is a way to buy some cakes and some doughnuts for exactly N dollars, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

If you buy one cake and one doughnut, the total will be 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find out if it is possible to buy some cakes and some doughnuts for exactly N dollars. We can start by considering the following cases:

1. Buy zero cakes and zero doughnuts: This is a valid solution, as we can buy zero cakes and zero doughnuts for exactly 0 dollars.
2. Buy one cake and one doughnut: This is also a valid solution, as we can buy one cake for 4 dollars and one doughnut for 7 dollars, for a total of 11 dollars.
3. Buy more than one cake and more than one doughnut: In this case, we can buy more than one cake and more than one doughnut, but we need to make sure that the total cost is exactly N dollars. For example, if N = 11, we can buy two cakes for 4 dollars each, and two doughnuts for 7 dollars each, for a total of 16 dollars.

Therefore, the solution to this problem is to check if the total cost of buying some cakes and some doughn

In the Ancient Kingdom of Snuke, there was a pyramid to strengthen the authority of Takahashi, the president of AtCoder Inc.

The pyramid had center coordinates (C_X, C_Y) and height H. The altitude of coordinates (X, Y) is max(H - |X - C_X| - |Y - C_Y|, 0).  
Aoki, an explorer, conducted a survey to identify the center coordinates and height of this pyramid. As a result, he obtained the following information:  
 - C_X, C_Y was integers between 0 and 100 (inclusive), and H was an integer not less than 1.  
 - Additionally, he obtained N pieces of information. The i-th of them is: "the altitude of point (x_i, y_i) is h_i."  
This was enough to identify the center coordinates and the height of the pyramid. Find these values with the clues above.  

-----Constraints-----
 - N is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
 - x_i and y_i are integers between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
 - h_i is an integer between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive).
 - The N coordinates (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), ..., (x_N, y_N) are all different.
 - The center coordinates and the height of the pyramid can be uniquely identified.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:  
N
x_1 y_1 h_1
x_2 y_2 h_2
x_3 y_3 h_3
:
x_N y_N h_N

-----Output-----

-----Sample Input-----
4
2 3 5
2 1 5
1 2 5
3 2 5

-----Sample Output-----
2 2 6

In this case, the center coordinates and the height can be identified as (2, 2) and 6.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the center coordinates and the height of the pyramid. We are given N pieces of information, which are the altitudes of the points (x_i, y_i). We can use these altitudes to find the center coordinates and the height of the pyramid.

First, we can find the maximum altitude of any point on the pyramid. This is the maximum of all the altitudes of the points. Let's call this maximum altitude M.

Next, we can find the center coordinates by finding the point with the maximum altitude. Let's call this point (C_X, C_Y).

Finally, we can find the height of the pyramid by finding the maximum distance from the center point to any point on the pyramid. Let's call this maximum distance H.

The center coordinates and the height of the pyramid can be uniquely identified, so we can print them in one line with spaces in between.

Here's the solution in words:

Takahashi loves palindromes. Non-palindromic strings are unacceptable to him. Each time he hugs a string, he can change one of its characters to any character of his choice.
Given is a string S. Find the minimum number of hugs needed to make S palindromic.

 - The length of S is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
Print the minimum number of hugs needed to make S palindromic.

-----Sample Output-----

For example, we can change the fourth character to o and get a palindrome redooder.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of hugs needed to make the given string S palindromic.

We can start by checking if S is already a palindrome. If it is, we don't need to hug it at all. If it's not, we need to find the minimum number of hugs needed to make it palindromic.

To do this, we can use a technique called "dynamic programming." We can break down the problem into smaller sub-problems, and use the solutions to these sub-problems to find the overall solution.

Let's define a function, hugs(S), that takes a string S as input and returns the minimum number of hugs needed to make it palindromic.

We can define hugs(S) as follows:

* If S is already a palindrome, return 0.
* Otherwise, find the first character c in S that is not in the middle of the string.
* If there is no such character, return -1.
* Otherwise, return 1 + hugs(S without c).

Given an integer N, determine whether N can be represented as the product of two integers between 1 and 9. If it can, print Yes; if it cannot, print No.

-----Output-----
If N can be represented as the product of two integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive), print Yes; if it cannot, print No.

10 can be represented as, for example, 2 \times 5.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to check if N can be expressed as the product of two integers between 1 and 9. We can do this by trying all possible combinations of two integers between 1 and 9 and checking if their product is equal to N.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input N from Standard Input.
2. Initialize two variables, x and y, to 1 and 9, respectively.
3. While x is less than or equal to y, perform the following steps:
a. Multiply x and y.
b. If the result is equal to N, print "Yes" and exit the loop.
c. Increment x by 1.
4. If x is greater than y, print "No" and exit the loop.

In summary, we need to check if N can be expressed as the product of two integers between 1 and 9 by trying all possible combinations of two integers between 1 and 9 and checking if their product is equal to N. If we find a combination that works, we print "Yes" and exit the loop. If we don't find any combination that works

We have sticks numbered 1, \cdots, N. The length of Stick i (1 \leq i \leq N) is L_i.
In how many ways can we choose three of the sticks with different lengths that can form a triangle?
That is, find the number of triples of integers (i, j, k) (1 \leq i < j < k \leq N) that satisfy both of the following conditions:
 - L_i, L_j, and L_k are all different.
 - There exists a triangle whose sides have lengths L_i, L_j, and L_k.

The following five triples (i, j, k) satisfy the conditions: (1, 3, 4), (1, 4, 5), (2, 3, 4), (2, 4, 5), and (3, 4, 5).

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of ways to choose three sticks with different lengths that can form a triangle.

We can solve this problem by first finding the number of ways to choose three sticks with different lengths. We can do this by using the formula for the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items, which is given by the binomial coefficient:

n! / (k! \* (n-k)!)

In this case, we have n = N, k = 3, and n-k = N-3. So, we can calculate the number of ways to choose three sticks with different lengths as follows:

N! / (3! \* (N-3)!)

We can then subtract the number of ways to choose three sticks with the same length, which is given by the formula:

(N-1) \* (N-2) \* (N-3)

This gives us the final answer:

N! / (3! \* (N-3)!) - (N-1) \* (N-2) \* (N-3)

If A and B are both between 1 and 9, we can check if the multiplication of A and B is possible using the multiplication table.

The objective can be achieved in five moves as follows, and this is the minimum number of moves required.

 - Move the piece at coordinate 1 to 2.
 - Move the piece at coordinate 10 to 11.
 - Move the piece at coordinate 11 to 12.
 - Move the piece at coordinate 12 to 13.
 - Move the piece at coordinate 13 to 14.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of moves required to visit all the coordinates X_1, X_2,..., X_M using N pieces. The move is to choose a piece and move it to the next or previous coordinate. The coordinates where the pieces are initially placed are already visited.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by placing the N pieces at the coordinates X_1, X_2,..., X_M. Then, we can move the pieces to the next or previous coordinate one by one, following the move rule.

We can use a hash table to keep track of the coordinates that have been visited. For each coordinate, we can store the number of pieces that have been placed at that coordinate. We can also use a queue to keep track of the coordinates that need to be visited.

The key insight is that we can visit all the coordinates in the order of their absolute values. We can use a priority queue to keep track of the coordinates in this order. We can use the absolute value of each coordinate as the priority of the coordinate in the queue.

We can start by placing the N pieces at the coordinates X_1, X_

There are $n$ cities in Berland. Some pairs of cities are connected by roads. All roads are bidirectional. Each road connects two different cities. There is at most one road between a pair of cities. The cities are numbered from $1$ to $n$.

It is known that, from the capital (the city with the number $1$), you can reach any other city by moving along the roads.

The President of Berland plans to improve the country's road network. The budget is enough to repair exactly $n-1$ roads. The President plans to choose a set of $n-1$ roads such that:

  it is possible to travel from the capital to any other city along the $n-1$ chosen roads,  if $d_i$ is the number of roads needed to travel from the capital to city $i$, moving only along the $n-1$ chosen roads, then $d_1 + d_2 + \dots + d_n$ is minimized (i.e. as minimal as possible). 

In other words, the set of $n-1$ roads should preserve the connectivity of the country, and the sum of distances from city $1$ to all cities should be minimized (where you can only use the $n-1$ chosen roads).

The president instructed the ministry to prepare $k$ possible options to choose $n-1$ roads so that both conditions above are met.

Write a program that will find $k$ possible ways to choose roads for repair. If there are fewer than $k$ ways, then the program should output all possible valid ways to choose roads.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($2 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, n-1 \le m \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le k \le 2\cdot10^5$), where $n$ is the number of cities in the country, $m$ is the number of roads and $k$ is the number of options to choose a set of roads for repair. It is guaranteed that $m \cdot k \le 10^6$.

The following $m$ lines describe the roads, one road per line. Each line contains two integers $a_i$, $b_i$ ($1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$, $a_i \ne b_i$) — the numbers of the cities that the $i$-th road connects. There is at most one road between a pair of cities. The given set of roads is such that you can reach any city from the capital.


-----Output-----

Print $t$ ($1 \le t \le k$) — the number of ways to choose a set of roads for repair. Recall that you need to find $k$ different options; if there are fewer than $k$ of them, then you need to find all possible different valid options.

In the following $t$ lines, print the options, one per line. Print an option as a string of $m$ characters where the $j$-th character is equal to '1' if the $j$-th road is included in the option, and is equal to '0' if the road is not included. The roads should be numbered according to their order in the input. The options can be printed in any order. All the $t$ lines should be different.

Since it is guaranteed that $m \cdot k \le 10^6$, the total length of all the $t$ lines will not exceed $10^6$.

If there are several answers, output any of them.

-----Plan-----
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a matrix dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of roads needed to travel from the capital to city i using only the first i roads, and using only the roads in the first j options.

The base case is dp[0][0] = 0, since there is no need to travel from the capital to any city if there are no roads.

For the recursive case, we have the following formula:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1, dp[i-1][j] + 1)

This formula is based on the fact that we can either use the j-th option (which includes the j-th road) or not use the j-th option (which means we don't use the j-th road). The minimum number of roads needed to travel from the capital to city i using only the first i roads and using only the roads in the first j options is the minimum of the two options.

The final answer is dp[n-1][k], which

Vova's family is building the Great Vova Wall (named by Vova himself). Vova's parents, grandparents, grand-grandparents contributed to it. Now it's totally up to Vova to put the finishing touches.

The current state of the wall can be respresented by a sequence $a$ of $n$ integers, with $a_i$ being the height of the $i$-th part of the wall.

Vova can only use $2 \times 1$ bricks to put in the wall (he has infinite supply of them, however).

Vova can put bricks horizontally on the neighboring parts of the wall of equal height. It means that if for some $i$ the current height of part $i$ is the same as for part $i + 1$, then Vova can put a brick there and thus increase both heights by 1. Obviously, Vova can't put bricks in such a way that its parts turn out to be off the borders (to the left of part $1$ of the wall or to the right of part $n$ of it).

The next paragraph is specific to the version 1 of the problem.

Vova can also put bricks vertically. That means increasing height of any part of the wall by 2.

Vova is a perfectionist, so he considers the wall completed when:

  all parts of the wall has the same height;  the wall has no empty spaces inside it. 

Can Vova complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero)?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of parts in the wall.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the initial heights of the parts of the wall.

Print "YES" if Vova can complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero).

Print "NO" otherwise.

In the first example Vova can put a brick on parts 2 and 3 to make the wall $[2, 2, 2, 2, 5]$ and then put 3 bricks on parts 1 and 2 and 3 bricks on parts 3 and 4 to make it $[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]$.

In the second example Vova can put a brick vertically on part 3 to make the wall $[4, 5, 5]$, then horizontally on parts 2 and 3 to make it $[4, 6, 6]$ and then vertically on part 1 to make it $[6, 6, 6]$.

In the third example the wall is already complete.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking whether Vova can complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero). The wall is represented by a sequence of integers, where each integer represents the height of a part of the wall. Vova can put bricks horizontally on neighboring parts of equal height, and vertically to increase the height of any part by 2. The wall is considered complete when all parts have the same height and there are no empty spaces inside it.

To solve this problem, we need to check whether it is possible to complete the wall using any amount of bricks. We can do this by checking whether it is possible to increase the height of all parts to the maximum height among them.

We can start by finding the maximum height among the parts. If the maximum height is greater than the height of any part, then it is not possible to complete the wall using any amount of bricks.

Next, we can check whether it is possible to increase the height of all parts to the maximum height. We can do this by iterating through each part and checking whether it is possible to increase its height by 1 or 2. If it is not possible to increase the height of any part, then it

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
A superhero fights with a monster. The battle consists of rounds, each of which lasts exactly $n$ minutes. After a round ends, the next round starts immediately. This is repeated over and over again.

Each round has the same scenario. It is described by a sequence of $n$ numbers: $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$ ($-10^6 \le d_i \le 10^6$). The $i$-th element means that monster's hp (hit points) changes by the value $d_i$ during the $i$-th minute of each round. Formally, if before the $i$-th minute of a round the monster's hp is $h$, then after the $i$-th minute it changes to $h := h + d_i$.

The monster's initial hp is $H$. It means that before the battle the monster has $H$ hit points. Print the first minute after which the monster dies. The monster dies if its hp is less than or equal to $0$. Print -1 if the battle continues infinitely.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $H$ and $n$ ($1 \le H \le 10^{12}$, $1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5$). The second line contains the sequence of integers $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$ ($-10^6 \le d_i \le 10^6$), where $d_i$ is the value to change monster's hp in the $i$-th minute of a round.


-----Output-----

Print -1 if the superhero can't kill the monster and the battle will last infinitely. Otherwise, print the positive integer $k$ such that $k$ is the first minute after which the monster is dead.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the first minute after which the monster's hp will be less than or equal to 0, if the battle continues indefinitely. We can solve this problem by analyzing the sequence of hp changes given in the input.

Let's consider the first round. The monster's hp is initially $H$, and it changes by $d_1$ in the first minute of the round. If $d_1 > 0$, the monster's hp will increase by $d_1$ in the first minute, and it will be greater than $H$ after the first minute. If $d_1 < 0$, the monster's hp will decrease by $d_1$ in the first minute, and it will be less than or equal to $H$ after the first minute.

In the second round, the monster's hp is initially $H + d_1$, and it changes by $d_2$ in the second minute of the round. If $d_2 > 0$, the monster's hp will increase by $d_2$ in the second minute, and it

Two-gram is an ordered pair (i.e. string of length two) of capital Latin letters. For example, "AZ", "AA", "ZA" — three distinct two-grams.

You are given a string $s$ consisting of $n$ capital Latin letters. Your task is to find any two-gram contained in the given string as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times. For example, for string $s$ = "BBAABBBA" the answer is two-gram "BB", which contained in $s$ three times. In other words, find any most frequent two-gram.

Note that occurrences of the two-gram can overlap with each other.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integer number $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the length of string $s$. The second line of the input contains the string $s$ consisting of $n$ capital Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print the only line containing exactly two capital Latin letters — any two-gram contained in the given string $s$ as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times.


-----Examples-----
Input
7
ABACABA

Output
AB

Input
5
ZZZAA

Output
ZZ



-----Note-----

In the first example "BA" is also valid answer.

In the second example the only two-gram "ZZ" can be printed because it contained in the string "ZZZAA" two times.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the most frequent two-gram in a given string. A two-gram is a string of length two, consisting of two consecutive characters. For example, "AB" is a two-gram in the string "ABACABA".

To solve this problem, we can use a hash table to keep track of the number of times each two-gram appears in the string. We can iterate through the string, and for each character, we can check if the next character is also a character in the string. If it is, we can add the two-gram to the hash table, and increment the count for that two-gram.

Once we have counted all the two-grams in the string, we can find the most frequent two-gram by finding the two-gram with the highest count. We can do this by iterating through the hash table and finding the two-gram with the highest count.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Python:
```
def most_frequent_two_gram(s):
    # Initialize a hash table to keep track of the number of times each two-gram appears
    two_grams = {}

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
You are given two strings $s$ and $t$. In a single move, you can choose any of two strings and delete the first (that is, the leftmost) character. After a move, the length of the string decreases by $1$. You can't choose a string if it is empty.

For example:  by applying a move to the string "where", the result is the string "here",  by applying a move to the string "a", the result is an empty string "". 

You are required to make two given strings equal using the fewest number of moves. It is possible that, in the end, both strings will be equal to the empty string, and so, are equal to each other. In this case, the answer is obviously the sum of the lengths of the initial strings.

Write a program that finds the minimum number of moves to make two given strings $s$ and $t$ equal.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains $s$. In the second line of the input contains $t$. Both strings consist only of lowercase Latin letters. The number of letters in each string is between 1 and $2\cdot10^5$, inclusive.


-----Output-----

Output the fewest number of moves required. It is possible that, in the end, both strings will be equal to the empty string, and so, are equal to each other. In this case, the answer is obviously the sum of the lengths of the given strings.

west

Output
2

Input
codeforces
yes

Output
9

Input
test
yes

Output
7

Input
b
ab

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, you should apply the move once to the first string and apply the move once to the second string. As a result, both strings will be equal to "est".

In the second example, the move should be applied to the string "codeforces" $8$ times. As a result, the string becomes "codeforces" $\to$ "es". The move should be applied to the string "yes" once. The result is the same string "yes" $\to$ "es".

In the third example, you can make the strings equal only by completely deleting them. That is, in the end, both strings will be empty.

In the fourth example, the first character of the second string should be deleted.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves required to make two given strings $s$ and $t$ equal. We can do this by keeping track of the number of moves required to make each string equal to the empty string.

Let $s_1$ and $t_1$ be the strings obtained by deleting the first character of $s$ and $t$, respectively. Then, we can recursively apply the same approach to $s_1$ and $t_1$.

If $s$ and $t$ are already equal to the empty string, then the answer is the sum of the lengths of the initial strings.

Otherwise, we can apply the move once to either $s$ or $t$, depending on which string has the smaller length. If we apply the move to $s$, then we need to apply the move $s_1$ times to $s_1$ and $t_1$ times to $t_1$. If we apply the move to $t$, then we need to apply the move $t_1$ times to $s_1$ and $s_1$ times to $t_1$.

There are N cities on a number line. The i-th city is located at coordinate x_i.
Your objective is to visit all these cities at least once.
In order to do so, you will first set a positive integer D.
Then, you will depart from coordinate X and perform Move 1 and Move 2 below, as many times as you like:
 - Move 1: travel from coordinate y to coordinate y + D.
 - Move 2: travel from coordinate y to coordinate y - D.
Find the maximum value of D that enables you to visit all the cities.
Here, to visit a city is to travel to the coordinate where that city is located.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq X \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq x_i \leq 10^9
 - x_i are all different.
 - x_1, x_2, ..., x_N \neq X

-----Input-----

N X
x_1 x_2 ... x_N

-----Output-----
Print the maximum value of D that enables you to visit all the cities.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----

Setting D = 2 enables you to visit all the cities as follows, and this is the maximum value of such D.
 - Perform Move 2 to travel to coordinate 1.
 - Perform Move 1 to travel to coordinate 3.
 - Perform Move 1 to travel to coordinate 5.
 - Perform Move 1 to travel to coordinate 7.
 - Perform Move 1 to travel to coordinate 9.
 - Perform Move 1 to travel to coordinate 11.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum value of D such that it is possible to visit all the cities at least once. The cities are located at coordinates x1, x2,..., xN.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start at coordinate X and perform Move 1 and Move 2 as many times as we like. We can perform Move 1 to travel to coordinates y + D and y - D, where y is the current coordinate.

We can start by setting D = 1. We can then perform Move 1 to travel to coordinates y + 1 and y - 1. If we can reach all the cities at coordinates y + 1 and y - 1, we can set D = 2 and perform Move 1 to travel to coordinates y + 2 and y - 2.

We can continue this process by setting D = 3, then D = 4, and so on. We can keep increasing D until we can no longer reach all the cities at coordinates y + D and y - D.

The maximum value of D that enables us to visit all the cities is the largest D such that we can reach all the cities

A string S of an odd length is said to be a strong palindrome if and only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
 - S is a palindrome.
 - Let N be the length of S. The string formed by the 1-st through ((N-1)/2)-th characters of S is a palindrome.
 - The string consisting of the (N+3)/2-st through N-th characters of S is a palindrome.
Determine whether S is a strong palindrome.

-----Constraints-----
 - S consists of lowercase English letters.
 - The length of S is an odd number between 3 and 99 (inclusive).

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
If S is a strong palindrome, print Yes;
otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

 - S is akasaka.
 - The string formed by the 1-st through the 3-rd characters is aka.
 - The string formed by the 5-th through the 7-th characters is aka.
All of these are palindromes, so S is a strong palindrome.

-----Plan-----
To determine whether a string S is a strong palindrome, we need to check if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. S is a palindrome.
2. The string formed by the 1-st through the (N-1)/2-th characters is a palindrome.
3. The string formed by the (N+3)/2-th through the N-th characters is a palindrome.

We can solve this problem by iterating through the characters of S and checking if they are the same as the corresponding characters in the string formed by the 1-st through the (N-1)/2-th characters and the (N+3)/2-th through the N-th characters. If all of these conditions are satisfied, then S is a strong palindrome.

Here is an example of how we can implement this solution in Python:
```
def is_strong_palindrome(s):
    # Check if S is a palindrome
    if s == s[::-1]:
        # Check if the string formed by the 1-st through the (N-1)/2-th characters is a palindrome

There are two sisters Alice and Betty. You have $n$ candies. You want to distribute these $n$ candies between two sisters in such a way that:  Alice will get $a$ ($a > 0$) candies;  Betty will get $b$ ($b > 0$) candies;  each sister will get some integer number of candies;  Alice will get a greater amount of candies than Betty (i.e. $a > b$);  all the candies will be given to one of two sisters (i.e. $a+b=n$). 

Your task is to calculate the number of ways to distribute exactly $n$ candies between sisters in a way described above. Candies are indistinguishable.

Formally, find the number of ways to represent $n$ as the sum of $n=a+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $a>b$.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^9$) — the number of candies you have.

-----Note-----

For the test case of the example, the $3$ possible ways to distribute candies are:  $a=6$, $b=1$;  $a=5$, $b=2$;  $a=4$, $b=3$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to represent $n$ as the sum of $n=a+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $a>b$.

We can start by considering the case where $n$ is even. In this case, we can write $n=2k$ for some integer $k$. Then, we can write $a=k+1$ and $b=k$, which satisfies all the conditions.

Now, let's consider the case where $n$ is odd. In this case, we can write $n=2k+1$ for some integer $k$. Then, we can write $a=k+1$ and $b=k+1$, which also satisfies all the conditions.

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute exactly $n$ candies between two sisters in a way described in the problem statement is the sum of the number of ways to represent $n$ as the sum of $n=a+b$ for even $n$ and the number of ways to represent $n$ as the sum of $n=a+b$ for odd $n$.

The first line of input consists of three integers $n$, $m$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 5000, 0 \le m \le 5000, 1 \le s \le n$) — the number of cities, the number of roads and the index of the capital. Cities are indexed from $1$ to $n$.

For each pair of cities $(u, v)$, there can be at most one road from $u$ to $v$. Roads in opposite directions between a pair of cities are allowed (i.e. from $u$ to $v$ and from $v$ to $u$).

The input consists of the number of cities, the number of roads, and the index of the capital. The output is the minimum number of extra roads needed to make all the cities reachable from the capital.

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search algorithm. We start at the capital and explore all the reachable cities from it. We keep track of the number of new roads that we need to build to make all the cities reachable. We can use a set to keep track of the cities that we have already visited.

Here is a step-by-step description of the algorithm:

1. Initialize the set of visited cities to be empty.
2. Initialize the number of new roads to be 0.
3. Start at the capital and explore all the reachable cities from it.
4. For each city that we visit, if it is not in the set of visited cities, we add it to the set of visited cities and increment the number of new roads

There are $n$ boxers, the weight of the $i$-th boxer is $a_i$. Each of them can change the weight by no more than $1$ before the competition (the weight cannot become equal to zero, that is, it must remain positive). Weight is always an integer number.

It is necessary to choose the largest boxing team in terms of the number of people, that all the boxers' weights in the team are different (i.e. unique).

Write a program that for given current values ​$a_i$ will find the maximum possible number of boxers in a team.

It is possible that after some change the weight of some boxer is $150001$ (but no more).


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 150000$) — the number of boxers. The next line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, where $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 150000$) is the weight of the $i$-th boxer.

-----Note-----

In the first example, boxers should not change their weights — you can just make a team out of all of them.

In the second example, one boxer with a weight of $1$ can be increased by one (get the weight of $2$), one boxer with a weight of $4$ can be reduced by one, and the other can be increased by one (resulting the boxers with a weight of $3$ and $5$, respectively). Thus, you can get a team consisting of boxers with weights of $5, 4, 3, 2, 1$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum possible number of boxers in a team such that all the boxers' weights in the team are different (i.e. unique). The weights of the boxers can be changed by no more than 1 before the competition, and the weight cannot become equal to zero.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by selecting the boxer with the largest weight and adding them to the team. Then, we can select the boxer with the next largest weight and add them to the team if their weight is different from the weight of the boxer we just added. We continue this process until we have added all the boxers to the team.

The key insight is that we can always add a boxer to the team if their weight is different from the weight of the boxer we just added. This is because we can always increase the weight of the boxer we just added by 1, and then add the boxer with the weight of $a_i$ to the team.

Therefore, the maximum possible number of boxers in a team is $n$, where $n$ is the number of boxers.

We can start by sorting the cities by their prefecture number and city number within that prefecture. We can use a hash table to keep track of the city numbers within each prefecture.

For each prefecture, we can start assigning ID numbers to the cities in order of their city number within that prefecture. We can use a counter to keep track of the city number within each prefecture.

Here's an example of how we can implement this:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N, M;
    cin >> N >> M;

    vector<int> prefecture(M);
    vector<int> city(M);
    vector<int> year(M);

There are N monsters, numbered 1, 2, ..., N.
Initially, the health of Monster i is A_i.
Below, a monster with at least 1 health is called alive.
Until there is only one alive monster, the following is repeated:
 - A random alive monster attacks another random alive monster.
 - As a result, the health of the monster attacked is reduced by the amount equal to the current health of the monster attacking.
Find the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

-----Output-----
Print the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive.

-----Sample Input-----
4
2 10 8 40

-----Sample Output-----
2

When only the first monster keeps on attacking, the final health of the last monster will be 2, which is minimum.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive after a series of attacks. The attacking monster reduces the health of the attacked monster by the amount of its own health. The attacking monster is chosen randomly from the set of alive monsters.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive after all the attacks have been made. We can do this by analyzing the attack pattern and finding the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive after each attack.

Let's consider the attack pattern for the given example:

1. The first monster attacks the second monster, reducing its health to 8.
2. The third monster attacks the fourth monster, reducing its health to 40 - 8 = 32.
3. The first monster attacks the third monster again, reducing its health to 32 - 8 = 24.
4. The second monster attacks the fourth monster again, reducing its health to 40 - 8 - 8 = 24.

After the fourth attack, the last monster alive has a health

Golorps are mysterious creatures who feed on variables. Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.

Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.

For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.

A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) — the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.


-----Output-----

Output lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output "false".


-----Examples-----
Input
?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.

Output
0010

Input
?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.

Output
false

Input
?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.

Output
0250341

Input
?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.

Output
0101

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to understand the rules of feeding golorps. A golorp's name is a program in some programming language, and the language is assumed to be Befunge. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.

The first step is to identify the shape of the jaws. The name of the golorp is a string of characters, and each character represents a variable. The shape of the jaws is determined by the number of characters in the name.

For example, if the name of the golorp is "?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.", then the shape of the jaws is 5, because there are 5 characters in the name.

Once we know the shape of the jaws, we can determine the number of variables that the golorp can consume. The number of variables is equal to the shape of the jaws.

For example, if the shape of the jaws is 5, then the golorp can consume 5 variables.

Now, we need to determine the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values that will feed the golorp. This is

There is a rectangular grid of size $n \times m$. Each cell has a number written on it; the number on the cell ($i, j$) is $a_{i, j}$. Your task is to calculate the number of paths from the upper-left cell ($1, 1$) to the bottom-right cell ($n, m$) meeting the following constraints:

  You can move to the right or to the bottom only. Formally, from the cell ($i, j$) you may move to the cell ($i, j + 1$) or to the cell ($i + 1, j$). The target cell can't be outside of the grid.  The xor of all the numbers on the path from the cell ($1, 1$) to the cell ($n, m$) must be equal to $k$ (xor operation is the bitwise exclusive OR, it is represented as '^' in Java or C++ and "xor" in Pascal). 

Find the number of such paths in the given grid.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, m \le 20$, $0 \le k \le 10^{18}$) — the height and the width of the grid, and the number $k$.

The next $n$ lines contain $m$ integers each, the $j$-th element in the $i$-th line is $a_{i, j}$ ($0 \le a_{i, j} \le 10^{18}$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of paths from ($1, 1$) to ($n, m$) with xor sum equal to $k$.

All the paths from the second example:   $(1, 1) \rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (3, 1) \rightarrow (3, 2) \rightarrow (3, 3) \rightarrow (3, 4)$;  $(1, 1) \rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (3, 2) \rightarrow (3, 3) \rightarrow (3, 4)$;  $(1, 1) \rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (3, 4)$;  $(1, 1) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (3, 3) \rightarrow (3, 4)$;  $(1, 1) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (3, 3) \rightarrow (3, 4)$.

-----Plan-----
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of paths from the top-left cell (1, 1) to the cell (i, j) that have a xor sum equal to k.

The base case is dp[1][1] = 1, as there is only one path from (1, 1) to (1, 1) with xor sum equal to 0.

For each cell (i, j) in the grid, we can calculate dp[i][j] using the following formula:

dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]

This formula is derived from the fact that for each cell (i, j), we can either move to the cell (i - 1, j) or to the cell (i, j - 1) to get to the cell (i, j).

The final answer is dp[n][m], which represents the number of paths from the top-left cell (1, 1)

A string $s$ of length $n$ can be encrypted by the following algorithm:  iterate over all divisors of $n$ in decreasing order (i.e. from $n$ to $1$),  for each divisor $d$, reverse the substring $s[1 \dots d]$ (i.e. the substring which starts at position $1$ and ends at position $d$). 

For example, the above algorithm applied to the string $s$="codeforces" leads to the following changes: "codeforces" $\to$ "secrofedoc" $\to$ "orcesfedoc" $\to$ "rocesfedoc" $\to$ "rocesfedoc" (obviously, the last reverse operation doesn't change the string because $d=1$).

You are given the encrypted string $t$. Your task is to decrypt this string, i.e., to find a string $s$ such that the above algorithm results in string $t$. It can be proven that this string $s$ always exists and is unique.


-----Input-----

The first line of input consists of a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the length of the string $t$. The second line of input consists of the string $t$. The length of $t$ is $n$, and it consists only of lowercase Latin letters.

-----Note-----

The first example is described in the problem statement.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to decrypt a string that has been encrypted using the given algorithm. The algorithm reverses the substring of the string starting at position 1 and ending at position d for each divisor d of the length of the string.

To solve this problem, you need to find the original string that was encrypted. One way to do this is to apply the algorithm in reverse, starting from the length of the string and working backwards. For each divisor d of the length of the string, you can find the original substring by reversing the substring of the encrypted string starting at position 1 and ending at position d.

For example, if the encrypted string is "rocesfedoc" and the length of the string is 10, you can find the original substring by reversing the substring of the encrypted string starting at position 1 and ending at position 5, which is "rocesf". Then, you can find the original substring for the next divisor, which is 6, by reversing the substring of the encrypted string starting at position 6 and ending at position 10, which is "edoc".

Once you have found the original substring for each divisor, you can

The problem is to find the sum of two given integers, A and B, where A and B are both integers between 0 and 10^3. The input is given in the format of two integers separated by a single space. The output is the sum of the two integers.

To solve this problem, we can simply read the input as two integers, A and B, and then print the sum of A and B.

Here is an example of how to solve this problem in Python:
```
a, b = input().split()
print(int(a) + int(b))

In this example, we first read the input as two integers, A and B, using the `input()` function and the `split()` method to separate the two integers. We then convert the two integers to integers using the `int()` function and add them together using the `+` operator. Finally, we print the sum using the `print()` function.

You are given an arithmetic expression consisting of integers from 0 to 255 and addition/subtraction signs between them. Output a Brainfuck program which, when executed, will print the result of evaluating this expression.

We use a fairly standard Brainfuck interpreter for checking the programs:

Each operand will be an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive. The calculations result is guaranteed to be an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive (results of intermediary calculations might be outside of these boundaries).

The only difference between the easy and the hard versions is the maximum value of $k$.

You are given an infinite sequence of form "112123123412345$\dots$" which consist of blocks of all consecutive positive integers written one after another. The first block consists of all numbers from $1$ to $1$, the second one — from $1$ to $2$, the third one — from $1$ to $3$, $\dots$, the $i$-th block consists of all numbers from $1$ to $i$. 

So the first $56$ elements of the sequence are "11212312341234512345612345671234567812345678912345678910". Elements of the sequence are numbered from one. For example, the $1$-st element of the sequence is $1$, the $3$-rd element of the sequence is $2$, the $20$-th element of the sequence is $5$, the $38$-th element is $2$, the $56$-th element of the sequence is $0$.

Your task is to answer $q$ independent queries. In the $i$-th query you are given one integer $k_i$. Calculate the digit at the position $k_i$ of the sequence.

The condition can be satisfied by repainting the middle tile white.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the minimum number of tiles that need to be repainted so that any two adjacent tiles have different colors.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that checks each tile and its adjacent tiles to see if they have the same color. If they do, we can repaint one of the tiles to make them different colors.

We can start by checking the first tile. If it is black, we can repaint it white. If it is white, we can do nothing.

Next, we check the second tile. If it is black, we can repaint it white. If it is white, we can repaint the first tile black.

We continue this process until we reach the end of the row. If we have reached the end of the row and we have not yet found a pair of adjacent tiles with different colors, we can repaint the last tile white.

The number of tiles that need to be repainted is the number of tiles that are not already white. Since we have already checked each tile and its adjacent tiles, we know that we can repaint at most N-1 tiles to make sure that any

We can check this by iterating through the characters of S and checking if they are R, U, or D. If any character is not R, U, or D, we can immediately return "No" because the string does not satisfy condition 1.

Condition 2: Every character in an even position (2-nd, 4-th, 6-th) is L, U, or D.

We can check this by iterating through the characters of S and checking if they are L, U, or D. If any character is not L, U, or D, we can immediately return "No" because the string does not satisfy condition 2.

If both conditions are satisfied, we can return "Yes" because the string S is easily playable.

In 2028 and after a continuous growth, AtCoder Inc. finally built an empire with six cities (City 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)!
There are five means of transport in this empire:
 - Train: travels from City 1 to 2 in one minute. A train can occupy at most A people.
 - Bus: travels from City 2 to 3 in one minute. A bus can occupy at most B people.
 - Taxi: travels from City 3 to 4 in one minute. A taxi can occupy at most C people.
 - Airplane: travels from City 4 to 5 in one minute. An airplane can occupy at most D people.
 - Ship: travels from City 5 to 6 in one minute. A ship can occupy at most E people.
For each of them, one vehicle leaves the city at each integer time (time 0, 1, 2, ...).
There is a group of N people at City 1, and they all want to go to City 6.

At least how long does it take for all of them to reach there? 
You can ignore the time needed to transfer.  

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N, A, B, C, D, E \leq 10^{15}
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A

-----Output-----
Print the minimum time required for all of the people to reach City 6, in minutes.

-----Sample Input-----
5

5

-----Sample Output-----

One possible way to travel is as follows.
First, there are N = 5 people at City 1, as shown in the following image:

In the first minute, three people travels from City 1 to City 2 by train. Note that a train can only occupy at most three people.

In the second minute, the remaining two people travels from City 1 to City 2 by train, and two of the three people who were already at City 2 travels to City 3 by bus. Note that a bus can only occupy at most two people.

In the third minute, two people travels from City 2 to City 3 by train, and another two people travels from City 3 to City 4 by taxi.

From then on, if they continue traveling without stopping until they reach City 6, all of them can reach there in seven minutes.

There is no way for them to reach City 6 in 6 minutes or less.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum time required for all of the people to reach City 6.

We can start by considering the time it takes for each person to travel from City 1 to City 6. We know that the time it takes for a train to travel from City 1 to City 2 is one minute, and the time it takes for a bus to travel from City 2 to City 3 is one minute, and so on.

We also know that there are five means of transport in this empire: train, bus, taxi, airplane, and ship. Each of these means of transport can occupy at most A, B, C, D, and E people, respectively.

We can start by considering the time it takes for each person to travel from City 1 to City 2 by train. Since a train can occupy at most A people, we know that it takes at most A/A minutes for a train to travel from City 1 to City 2.

We can then consider the time it takes for each person to travel from City 2 to City 3 by bus. Since a bus can occupy at most B people, we

How many integer sequences A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_N of length N satisfy all of the following conditions?
 - 0 \leq A_i \leq 9
 - There exists some i such that A_i=0 holds.
 - There exists some i such that A_i=9 holds.
The answer can be very large, so output it modulo 10^9 + 7.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^6
 - N is an integer.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

-----Output-----
Print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

-----Sample Input-----
2

-----Sample Output-----
2

Two sequences \{0,9\} and \{9,0\} satisfy all conditions.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the number of integer sequences of length N that satisfy the following conditions:

1. Each element of the sequence is between 0 and 9, inclusive.
2. There exists at least one element in the sequence that is equal to 0.
3. There exists at least one element in the sequence that is equal to 9.

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of bitmasks and a dynamic programming approach.

First, let's consider the case where N is equal to 1. In this case, there is only one possible sequence, which is {0} or {9}. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Now, let's consider the case where N is greater than 1. We can divide the problem into two sub-problems:

1. Find the number of sequences of length N-1 that satisfy the conditions.
2. Find the number of sequences of length N-1 that do not satisfy the conditions.

We can use dynamic programming to solve the first sub-problem. We can create a 10x10 matrix, where the rows represent the possible values of the first element of the sequence

Find the minimum prime number greater than or equal to X.

-----Notes-----
A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that cannot be evenly divided by any positive integer except 1 and itself.
For example, 2, 3, and 5 are prime numbers, while 4 and 6 are not.

-----Constraints-----
 -  2 \le X \le 10^5 
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X

-----Output-----
Print the minimum prime number greater than or equal to X.

-----Sample Input-----
20

-----Sample Output-----
23

The minimum prime number greater than or equal to 20 is 23.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest prime number greater than or equal to X. We can do this by iterating through all prime numbers starting from 2 and checking if they are greater than or equal to X. If we find a prime number that is greater than or equal to X, we can print it and stop the loop. If we don't find any prime number that is greater than or equal to X, we can print -1.

Here's an example of how this solution would work:

Input: 20

1. Start at the first prime number, 2.
2. Check if 2 is greater than or equal to 20. Yes, so print 23.
3. Stop the loop.

Output: 23

Note that this solution is not the most efficient way to solve this problem, as it involves iterating through all prime numbers up to X. However, it is a simple and straightforward solution that works for small values of X.

A sequence a_1,a_2,... ,a_n is said to be /\/\/\/ when the following conditions are satisfied:

The sequence 3,1,3,2 is not /\/\/\/, but we can make it /\/\/\/ by replacing one of its elements: for example, replace the fourth element to make it 3,1,3,1.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of elements that need to be replaced in the given sequence to make it /\/\/\/.

We can start by analyzing the given sequence. We know that the sequence has an even number of elements, and that each element is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive. We also know that the sequence is not /\/\/\/, since it does not satisfy the first condition.

To make the sequence /\/\/\/, we need to replace some of its elements. We can start by looking at the first and last elements of the sequence. If the first element is not equal to the last element, we can replace the first element with the last element to make the sequence /\/\/\/.

For example, if the given sequence is 3,1,3,2, we can replace the first element 3 with the last element 2 to make it /\/\/\/.

However, if the first element is equal to the last element, we need to replace at least one of the elements in the middle of the sequence. We can do this by replacing the middle element with a different number.

For example, if the given sequence is 3

You have N bamboos. The lengths (in centimeters) of these are l_1, l_2, ..., l_N, respectively.
Your objective is to use some of these bamboos (possibly all) to obtain three bamboos of length A, B, C. For that, you can use the following three kinds of magics any number:
 - Extension Magic: Consumes 1 MP (magic point). Choose one bamboo and increase its length by 1.
 - Shortening Magic: Consumes 1 MP. Choose one bamboo of length at least 2 and decrease its length by 1.
 - Composition Magic: Consumes 10 MP. Choose two bamboos and combine them into one bamboo. The length of this new bamboo is equal to the sum of the lengths of the two bamboos combined. (Afterwards, further magics can be used on this bamboo.)
At least how much MP is needed to achieve the objective?

We are obtaining three bamboos of lengths 100, 90, 80 from five bamboos 98, 40, 30, 21, 80. We already have a bamboo of length 80, and we can obtain bamboos of lengths 100, 90 by using the magics as follows at the total cost of 23 MP, which is optimal.
 - Use Extension Magic twice on the bamboo of length 98 to obtain a bamboo of length 100. (MP consumed: 2)
 - Use Composition Magic on the bamboos of lengths 40, 30 to obtain a bamboo of length 70. (MP consumed: 10)
 - Use Shortening Magic once on the bamboo of length 21 to obtain a bamboo of length 20. (MP consumed: 1)
 - Use Composition Magic on the bamboo of length 70 obtained in step 2 and the bamboo of length 20 obtained in step 3 to obtain a bamboo of length 90. (MP consumed: 10)

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum amount of MP needed to obtain three bamboos of lengths A, B, C from N bamboos.

We can use the following three kinds of magics:

* Extension Magic: Consumes 1 MP and increases the length of a bamboo by 1.
* Shortening Magic: Consumes 1 MP and decreases the length of a bamboo by 1 if the length is at least 2.
* Composition Magic: Consumes 10 MP and combines two bamboos into one bamboo of length equal to the sum of the lengths of the two bamboos combined.

We can use these magics to obtain the three bamboos of lengths A, B, C from the N bamboos.

Let's assume we have N = 5 bamboos with lengths l_1, l_2,..., l_N. We want to obtain three bamboos of lengths A, B, C.

We have a string S consisting of uppercase English letters. Additionally, an integer N will be given.
Shift each character of S by N in alphabetical order (see below), and print the resulting string.
We assume that A follows Z. For example, shifting A by 2 results in C (A \to B \to C), and shifting Y by 3 results in B (Y \to Z \to A \to B).

Note that A follows Z.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to take a string S consisting of uppercase English letters and shift each character by N in alphabetical order. We need to assume that A follows Z, meaning that shifting A by 2 results in C (A \to B \to C), and shifting Y by 3 results in B (Y \to Z \to A \to B).

To solve this problem, we can use a loop to iterate through each character of S and shift it by N in alphabetical order. We can use the modulo operator (%) to wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet if the character is shifted beyond Z.

Here's an example of how we can implement this:
```
def shift_string(s, n):
    result = ""
    for c in s:
        if c.isalpha():
            new_c = chr((ord(c) - ord('A') + n) % 26 + ord('A'))
            result += new_c
        else:
            result += c
    return result

Authors guessed an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers; each integer is not less than $2$ and not greater than $2 \cdot 10^5$. You don't know the array $a$, but you know the array $b$ which is formed from it with the following sequence of operations:  Firstly, let the array $b$ be equal to the array $a$;  Secondly, for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$:   if $a_i$ is a prime number, then one integer $p_{a_i}$ is appended to array $b$, where $p$ is an infinite sequence of prime numbers ($2, 3, 5, \dots$);  otherwise (if $a_i$ is not a prime number), the greatest divisor of $a_i$ which is not equal to $a_i$ is appended to $b$;   Then the obtained array of length $2n$ is shuffled and given to you in the input. 

Here $p_{a_i}$ means the $a_i$-th prime number. The first prime $p_1 = 2$, the second one is $p_2 = 3$, and so on.

Your task is to recover any suitable array $a$ that forms the given array $b$. It is guaranteed that the answer exists (so the array $b$ is obtained from some suitable array $a$). If there are multiple answers, you can print any.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in $a$.

The second line of the input contains $2n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_{2n}$ ($2 \le b_i \le 2750131$), where $b_i$ is the $i$-th element of $b$. $2750131$ is the $199999$-th prime number.


-----Output-----

In the only line of the output print $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($2 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) in any order — the array $a$ from which the array $b$ can be obtained using the sequence of moves given in the problem statement. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to recover the original array $a$ from the shuffled array $b$. The given array $b$ is obtained from the array $a$ by performing the following sequence of operations:

1. Append the $i$-th prime number to the array $b$ if $a_i$ is a prime number.
2. Append the greatest divisor of $a_i$ that is not equal to $a_i$ to the array $b$ if $a_i$ is not a prime number.

The given array $b$ is shuffled, but the order of the elements is not changed. The goal is to recover the original array $a$ from the shuffled array $b$.

To solve this problem, we can use a technique called "backtracking". The idea is to start with an empty array $a$ and try to fill it in with the elements of $b$. At each step, we check if the current array $a$ can be obtained from the array $b$ by the sequence of operations given in the problem statement. If it can, we continue to fill in the array $a$ with the remaining elements of $b$. If

There are $n$ students standing in a row. Two coaches are forming two teams — the first coach chooses the first team and the second coach chooses the second team.

The $i$-th student has integer programming skill $a_i$. All programming skills are distinct and between $1$ and $n$, inclusive.

Firstly, the first coach will choose the student with maximum programming skill among all students not taken into any team, and $k$ closest students to the left of him and $k$ closest students to the right of him (if there are less than $k$ students to the left or to the right, all of them will be chosen). All students that are chosen leave the row and join the first team. Secondly, the second coach will make the same move (but all students chosen by him join the second team). Then again the first coach will make such move, and so on. This repeats until the row becomes empty (i. e. the process ends when each student becomes to some team).

Your problem is to determine which students will be taken into the first team and which students will be taken into the second team.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of students and the value determining the range of chosen students during each move, respectively.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$), where $a_i$ is the programming skill of the $i$-th student. It is guaranteed that all programming skills are distinct.

In the first example the first coach chooses the student on a position $3$, and the row becomes empty (all students join the first team).

In the second example the first coach chooses the student on position $4$, and the row becomes $[2, 1]$ (students with programming skills $[3, 4, 5]$ join the first team). Then the second coach chooses the student on position $1$, and the row becomes empty (and students with programming skills $[1, 2]$ join the second team).

In the third example the first coach chooses the student on position $1$, and the row becomes $[1, 3, 5, 4, 6]$ (students with programming skills $[2, 7]$ join the first team). Then the second coach chooses the student on position $5$, and the row becomes $[1, 3, 5]$ (students with programming skills $[4, 6]$ join the second team). Then the first coach chooses the student on position $3$, and the row becomes $[1]$ (students with programming skills $[3, 5]$ join the first team). And then the second coach chooses the remaining student (and the student with programming skill $1$ joins the second team).

In the fourth example the first coach chooses the student on position $3$, and the row becomes $[2, 1]$ (students with programming skills $[3, 4, 5]$ join the first team). Then the second coach chooses the student on position $1$, and the row becomes empty (and students with programming skills $[1, 2]$ join the second team).

-----Plan-----
The problem is to determine which students will be taken into the first team and which students will be taken into the second team. The solution is to use a greedy algorithm that chooses the student with the highest programming skill at each step, and then chooses the closest students to the left and right of the chosen student.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. The first coach chooses the student with the highest programming skill, which is the student with the highest programming skill among all students not taken into any team.
2. The first coach then chooses the $k$ closest students to the left of the chosen student, and the $k$ closest students to the right of the chosen student.
3. All students that are chosen by the first coach leave the row and join the first team.
4. The second coach then makes the same move as the first coach, choosing the student with the highest programming skill and the closest students to the left and right of the chosen student.
5. All students that are chosen by the second coach leave the row and join the second team.
6. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until the row becomes empty.

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. Let's denote monotonic renumeration of array $a$ as an array $b$ consisting of $n$ integers such that all of the following conditions are met:

  $b_1 = 0$;  for every pair of indices $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \le i, j \le n$, if $a_i = a_j$, then $b_i = b_j$ (note that if $a_i \ne a_j$, it is still possible that $b_i = b_j$);  for every index $i \in [1, n - 1]$ either $b_i = b_{i + 1}$ or $b_i + 1 = b_{i + 1}$. 

For example, if $a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]$, then two possible monotonic renumerations of $a$ are $b = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$ and $b = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]$.

The problem is asking for the number of different monotonic renumerations of an array $a$. A monotonic renumeration is an array $b$ such that $b_1 = 0$ and for every pair of indices $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \le i, j \le n$, if $a_i = a_j$, then $b_i = b_j$. Additionally, for every index $i \in [1, n - 1]$, either $b_i = b_{i + 1}$ or $b_i + 1 = b_{i + 1}$.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let $f(i, j)$ be the number of different monotonic renumerations of the first $i$ elements of $a$ that end with $j$. Then, we have the following recurrence relation:

$$f(i, j) = \begin{cases}

A sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ is called good if, for each element $a_i$, there exists an element $a_j$ ($i \ne j$) such that $a_i+a_j$ is a power of two (that is, $2^d$ for some non-negative integer $d$).

For example, the following sequences are good:  $[5, 3, 11]$ (for example, for $a_1=5$ we can choose $a_2=3$. Note that their sum is a power of two. Similarly, such an element can be found for $a_2$ and $a_3$),  $[1, 1, 1, 1023]$,  $[7, 39, 89, 25, 89]$,  $[]$. 

Note that, by definition, an empty sequence (with a length of $0$) is good.

For example, the following sequences are not good:  $[16]$ (for $a_1=16$, it is impossible to find another element $a_j$ such that their sum is a power of two),  $[4, 16]$ (for $a_1=4$, it is impossible to find another element $a_j$ such that their sum is a power of two),  $[1, 3, 2, 8, 8, 8]$ (for $a_3=2$, it is impossible to find another element $a_j$ such that their sum is a power of two).

-----Note-----

In the first example, it is enough to delete one element $a_4=5$. The remaining elements form the sequence $[4, 7, 1, 4, 9]$, which is good.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given sequence in order to make it "good". A good sequence is defined as follows: for each element $a_i$ in the sequence, there exists an element $a_j$ ($i \ne j$) such that $a_i+a_j$ is a power of two.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start by considering the first element of the sequence. If the first element is a power of two, then we can keep it in the sequence. Otherwise, we need to remove it.

Next, we consider the second element of the sequence. If the second element is a power of two, then we can keep it in the sequence. Otherwise, we need to remove it.

We continue this process until we reach the end of the sequence. If we have removed all the elements that are not powers of two, then we can keep the remaining elements in the sequence. Otherwise, we need to remove all the remaining elements that are not powers of two.

The key insight is that we can always find an element $a_j$ such that $a_i+a

There are N cubes stacked vertically on a desk.
You are given a string S of length N. The color of the i-th cube from the bottom is red if the i-th character in S is 0, and blue if that character is 1.
You can perform the following operation any number of times: choose a red cube and a blue cube that are adjacent, and remove them. Here, the cubes that were stacked on the removed cubes will fall down onto the object below them.
At most how many cubes can be removed?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - |S| = N
 - Each character in S is 0 or 1.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
Print the maximum number of cubes that can be removed.

-----Sample Input-----
0011

-----Sample Output-----

All four cubes can be removed, by performing the operation as follows:
 - Remove the second and third cubes from the bottom. Then, the fourth cube drops onto the first cube.
 - Remove the first and second cubes from the bottom.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the maximum number of cubes that can be removed from a stack of N cubes, where each cube has a color that is determined by the corresponding character in a given string S. The operation we can perform is to remove two adjacent cubes of different colors, and the cubes that fall down will be placed on top of the removed cubes.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by removing the two cubes that are at the bottom of the stack, since they are the only two cubes that we can remove. Then, we can continue to remove the next two cubes that are adjacent to the removed cubes, and so on.

We can keep track of the number of cubes that we have removed, and the number of cubes that we have left. We can stop removing cubes when we have removed all of the cubes from the stack, or when we have removed the maximum number of cubes that we can remove.

The maximum number of cubes that we can remove is the number of cubes that we have left, minus the number of cubes that we have removed. This is because we can only remove adjacent cub

-----Constraints-----

 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5

Two ID cards allow us to pass all the gates alone, as follows:
 - The first ID card does not allow us to pass the second gate.
 - The second ID card allows us to pass all the gates.
 - The third ID card allows us to pass all the gates.
 - The fourth ID card does not allow us to pass the first gate.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the number of ID cards that allow us to pass all the gates alone. We are given N ID cards and M gates, and we can pass the i-th gate if we have one of the following ID cards: the L_i-th, (L_i+1)-th,..., and R_i-th ID cards.

To solve this problem, we can use a bitmask to keep track of which ID cards we have. We can initialize the bitmask with all 0s, which means we don't have any ID cards. Then, for each gate, we can check if we have the ID cards that allow us to pass that gate. If we have all the required ID cards, we can set the corresponding bits in the bitmask to 1.

After we have processed all the gates, we can count the number of 1s in the bitmask to get the number of ID cards that allow us to pass all the gates alone.

Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the bitmask with all 0s.
2. For each gate, check if we have the ID cards that allow us to pass

In a flower bed, there are N flowers, numbered 1,2,......,N. Initially, the heights of all flowers are 0.
You are given a sequence h=\{h_1,h_2,h_3,......\} as input. You would like to change the height of Flower k to h_k for all k (1 \leq  k \leq N), by repeating the following "watering" operation:
 - Specify integers l and r. Increase the height of Flower x by 1 for all x such that l \leq x \leq r.
Find the minimum number of watering operations required to satisfy the condition.

-----Constraints-----

 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----

-----Output-----
Print the minimum number of watering operations required to satisfy the condition.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----
2

The minimum number of watering operations required is 2.
One way to achieve it is:
 - Perform the operation with (l,r)=(1,3).
 - Perform the operation with (l,r)=(2,4).

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of watering operations required to satisfy the condition that the height of each flower in the flower bed is equal to the corresponding value in the input sequence.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by watering all flowers with height 0, and then repeatedly water the flowers with height 1, then the flowers with height 2, and so on.

We can keep track of the number of watering operations required by keeping a count of the number of flowers with each height. We can start with the flowers with height 0, and then gradually increase the height of the flowers as we water them.

The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of flowers in the flower bed. The space complexity is O(N), where N is the number of flowers in the flower bed.

The solution is:

1. Initialize a count array of size N, where each element is 0.
2. For each flower with height 0, increment the count of the corresponding height in the count array.
3. For each flower with height 1, increment the count of the corresponding height in the count

The busses in Berland are equipped with a video surveillance system. The system records information about changes in the number of passengers in a bus after stops.

If $x$ is the number of passengers in a bus just before the current bus stop and $y$ is the number of passengers in the bus just after current bus stop, the system records the number $y-x$. So the system records show how number of passengers changed.

The test run was made for single bus and $n$ bus stops. Thus, the system recorded the sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ (exactly one number for each bus stop), where $a_i$ is the record for the bus stop $i$. The bus stops are numbered from $1$ to $n$ in chronological order.

Determine the number of possible ways how many people could be in the bus before the first bus stop, if the bus has a capacity equals to $w$ (that is, at any time in the bus there should be from $0$ to $w$ passengers inclusive).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $w$ $(1 \le n \le 1\,000, 1 \le w \le 10^{9})$ — the number of bus stops and the capacity of the bus.

The second line contains a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ $(-10^{6} \le a_i \le 10^{6})$, where $a_i$ equals to the number, which has been recorded by the video system after the $i$-th bus stop.


-----Output-----

Print the number of possible ways how many people could be in the bus before the first bus stop, if the bus has a capacity equals to $w$. If the situation is contradictory (i.e. for any initial number of passengers there will be a contradiction), print 0.

In the first example initially in the bus could be $0$, $1$ or $2$ passengers.

In the second example initially in the bus could be $1$, $2$, $3$ or $4$ passengers.

In the third example initially in the bus could be $0$ or $1$ passenger.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the number of possible ways that the number of passengers in the bus before the first bus stop can be determined, given the sequence of integers recorded by the video system. The video system records the number of passengers in the bus after each bus stop, and the bus has a capacity of $w$.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways that the number of passengers in the bus before the first bus stop can be determined, subject to the constraint that the number of passengers in the bus at any time must be between 0 and $w$.

We can approach this problem by considering all possible combinations of passengers in the bus before the first bus stop, and then counting the number of combinations that satisfy the constraint.

Let's consider a specific combination of passengers in the bus before the first bus stop. Let's say the combination is $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, where $x_i$ is the number of passengers in the bus before the $i$th bus stop.

We can determine the number of possible combinations of passengers in the bus before the first bus stop by considering all possible values of $x_1, x_2

Polycarp likes to play with numbers. He takes some integer number $x$, writes it down on the board, and then performs with it $n - 1$ operations of the two kinds:   divide the number $x$ by $3$ ($x$ must be divisible by $3$);  multiply the number $x$ by $2$. 

After each operation, Polycarp writes down the result on the board and replaces $x$ by the result. So there will be $n$ numbers on the board after all.

You are given a sequence of length $n$ — the numbers that Polycarp wrote down. This sequence is given in arbitrary order, i.e. the order of the sequence can mismatch the order of the numbers written on the board.

Your problem is to rearrange (reorder) elements of this sequence in such a way that it can match possible Polycarp's game in the order of the numbers written on the board. I.e. each next number will be exactly two times of the previous number or exactly one third of previous number.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contatins an integer number $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of the elements in the sequence. The second line of the input contains $n$ integer numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 3 \cdot 10^{18}$) — rearranged (reordered) sequence that Polycarp can wrote down on the board.


-----Output-----

Print $n$ integer numbers — rearranged (reordered) input sequence that can be the sequence that Polycarp could write down on the board.

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example the given sequence can be rearranged in the following way: $[9, 3, 6, 12, 4, 8]$. It can match possible Polycarp's game which started with $x = 9$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to rearrange the given sequence in such a way that each number is either twice the previous number or one third of the previous number.

We can start by sorting the sequence in ascending order. This will ensure that the first number in the sequence is the smallest number, and the last number is the largest number.

Next, we can start iterating through the sequence from the second element to the last element. For each element, we can either multiply it by 2 or divide it by 3, depending on whether the previous element is twice the current element or one third of the current element.

For example, if the current element is 4, and the previous element is 9, we can either multiply 4 by 2 to get 8, or divide 9 by 3 to get 3. If we choose to multiply 4 by 2, then the next element in the sequence will be 8, and the previous element will be 9. If we choose to divide 9 by 3, then the next element in the sequence will be 3, and the previous element will be 9.

By following this process, we can construct a rearr

There are $n$ distinct points on a coordinate line, the coordinate of $i$-th point equals to $x_i$. Choose a subset of the given set of points such that the distance between each pair of points in a subset is an integral power of two. It is necessary to consider each pair of points, not only adjacent. Note that any subset containing one element satisfies the condition above. Among all these subsets, choose a subset with maximum possible size.

In other words, you have to choose the maximum possible number of points $x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}, \dots, x_{i_m}$ such that for each pair $x_{i_j}$, $x_{i_k}$ it is true that $|x_{i_j} - x_{i_k}| = 2^d$ where $d$ is some non-negative integer number (not necessarily the same for each pair of points).


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of points.

The second line contains $n$ pairwise distinct integers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ ($-10^9 \le x_i \le 10^9$) — the coordinates of points.


-----Output-----

-----Note-----

In the first example the answer is $[7, 3, 5]$. Note, that $|7-3|=4=2^2$, $|7-5|=2=2^1$ and $|3-5|=2=2^1$. You can't find a subset having more points satisfying the required property.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum possible number of points in a subset of the given set of points such that the distance between each pair of points in the subset is an integral power of two.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by selecting the point with the smallest coordinate as the first point in our subset. Then, we can select the point with the next smallest coordinate that is closest to the previous point in our subset. We continue this process until we have selected all the points.

To determine the distance between each pair of points in our subset, we can use the formula:

|x_i - x_j| = 2^d

where d is the number of times we need to double the distance between the two points to get the required distance.

For example, if we have two points with coordinates 3 and 5, the distance between them is 2, so d = 1. If we have two points with coordinates 7 and 11, the distance between them is 4, so d = 2.

By following this greedy approach, we can ensure that the distance between each pair of points in our subset is an

 - Now he has one cookie left, and he eats it.
 - Now he has no cookies left, but Aoki has three, so Takahashi eats one of them.
Thus, in the end, Takahashi will have 0 cookies, and Aoki will have 2.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to simulate the actions of Takahashi and Aoki for K times. The rules for the actions are as follows:

* If Takahashi has one or more cookies, eat one of his cookies.
* Otherwise, if Aoki has one or more cookies, eat one of Aoki's cookies.
* If they both have no cookies, do nothing.

We need to keep track of the number of cookies that Takahashi and Aoki have at each step. At the end of K steps, we need to print the number of cookies that Takahashi and Aoki have, respectively.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can solve this problem:

1. Read the input: The input consists of three integers A, B, and K, which represent the number of cookies that Takahashi and Aoki have, and the number of actions that Takahashi will perform, respectively.
2. Initialize the variables: We need to initialize two variables, `takahashi` and `aoki`, to keep track of the number of cookies that Takahashi and Aoki have, respectively. We can initialize them to 0.

 - The balance after one year is 101 yen.
 - The balance after two years is 102 yen.
 - The balance after three years is 103 yen.
Thus, it takes three years for the balance to reach 103 yen or above.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of years it takes for Takahashi's balance to reach X yen or above for the first time.

We know that the annual interest rate is 1% and it is compounded annually. We also know that the balance after one year is 101 yen.

We can start by assuming that the balance after one year is 100 yen, since the interest rate is 1% and the balance is 100 yen. This means that the interest for the first year is 1 yen.

For the second year, we can assume that the balance is 101 yen, since the interest for the first year is 1 yen and the balance is 100 yen. This means that the interest for the second year is 1 yen.

For the third year, we can assume that the balance is 102 yen, since the interest for the first two years is 2 yen and the balance is 100 yen. This means that the interest for the third year is 2 yen.

Thus, the answer is 9.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the sum of the greatest common divisors of all possible triples of integers from 1 to K, where K is a given integer between 1 and 200.

To solve this problem, we can use a nested loop to iterate over all possible triples of integers from 1 to K. For each triple, we can calculate the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
2. Iterate over all possible triples of integers from 1 to K using nested loops.
3. For each triple, calculate the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.
4. Add the calculated greatest common divisor to the `sum` variable.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all possible triples have been considered.
6. Print the value of `sum`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(K^3), since we need to iterate over all possible triples of integers from 1 to K. The space complexity is O(1), since we only need to store the `sum` variable.

To find the maximum value of f, we need to find the maximum value of the sum of the remainders of m divided by each of the integers a_1, a_2,..., a_N.

We can do this by considering the following:

* For a given integer m, the sum of the remainders of m divided by each of the integers a_1, a_2,..., a_N is equal to the sum of the remainders of m divided by the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers a_1, a_2,..., a_N.

Given is an integer r.
How many times is the area of a circle of radius r larger than the area of a circle of radius 1?
It can be proved that the answer is always an integer under the constraints given.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq r \leq 100
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
r

-----Output-----
Print the area of a circle of radius r, divided by the area of a circle of radius 1, as an integer.

-----Sample Input-----
2

-----Sample Output-----
4

The area of a circle of radius 2 is 4 times larger than the area of a circle of radius 1.
Note that output must be an integer - for example, 4.0 will not be accepted.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking how many times the area of a circle of radius r is larger than the area of a circle of radius 1. To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the area of the two circles.

The area of a circle can be calculated using the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. So, if we want to find the ratio of the area of a circle of radius r to the area of a circle of radius 1, we can simply divide the area of the circle of radius r by the area of the circle of radius 1.

The area of a circle of radius 1 is A1 = π(1)^2 = π, and the area of a circle of radius r is A2 = π(r)^2. So, the ratio of the area of the two circles is A2/A1 = π(r)^2/π = r^2.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is r^2.

Determine if an N-sided polygon (not necessarily convex) with sides of length L_1, L_2, ..., L_N can be drawn in a two-dimensional plane.
You can use the following theorem:
Theorem: an N-sided polygon satisfying the condition can be drawn if and only if the longest side is strictly shorter than the sum of the lengths of the other N-1 sides.

If an N-sided polygon satisfying the condition can be drawn, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Output-----

Since 8 < 9 = 3 + 5 + 1, it follows from the theorem that such a polygon can be drawn on a plane.

-----Plan-----
To determine if an N-sided polygon with sides of length L_1, L_2,..., L_N can be drawn in a two-dimensional plane, we can use the following theorem:

Theorem: an N-sided polygon satisfying the condition can be drawn if and only if the longest side is strictly shorter than the sum of the lengths of the other N-1 sides.

To apply this theorem, we need to find the longest side of the polygon and compare it to the sum of the lengths of the other N-1 sides. If the longest side is strictly shorter than the sum of the lengths of the other N-1 sides, then the polygon can be drawn on a plane.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input: The first line of input contains an integer N, which is the number of sides of the polygon. The next N lines contain the lengths of the sides of the polygon.
2. Find the longest side: We need to find the longest side of the polygon. We can do this by comparing the lengths of the sides and keeping track of the longest side.
3. Calculate the sum of the lengths of the other N

702 satisfies the conditions - its 1-st and 3-rd digits are 7 and 2, respectively - while no non-negative integer less than 702 satisfies them.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the smallest non-negative integer that has exactly N digits in base 10 and satisfies the given conditions.

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of mathematical induction and a binary search algorithm.

First, we can prove that the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies the conditions is greater than or equal to 10^N - 1. This is because we can always add a digit to the left of the integer, and the new integer will still satisfy the conditions. Therefore, the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies the conditions is greater than or equal to 10^N - 1.

Next, we can use a binary search algorithm to find the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies the conditions. We can start by setting the lower bound to 10^N - 1 and the upper bound to 10^N. We can then repeatedly divide the upper bound by 10 and check if the resulting integer satisfies the conditions. If it does, we can set the upper bound to the resulting integer. If it doesn't, we can set the lower bound to the resulting integer.

Once we have found the smallest non-negative integer that

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of positive integers not greater than N such that a + b, b + c, and c + a are all multiples of K.

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of modular arithmetic and the fact that the sum of two multiples of K is also a multiple of K.

We can start by considering the case where a = b = c. In this case, we have a + b + c = 3K, which is a multiple of K. Therefore, there are K such triples.

Next, we consider the case where a = b and c = 1. In this case, we have a + b + c = 2K, which is also a multiple of K. Therefore, there are K such triples.

Now, we consider the case where a = 1 and b = c. In this case, we have a + b + c = 2K, which is also a multiple of K. Therefore, there are K such triples.

Finally, we consider the case where a = b = c = 1. In this case, we have

 - Unless S = 0, the initial character of S is 1.
 - Let S = S_k S_{k-1} ... S_0, then S_0 \times (-2)^0 + S_1 \times (-2)^1 + ... + S_k \times (-2)^k = N.
It can be proved that, for any integer M, the base -2 representation of M is uniquely determined.

-----Output-----

-----Sample Output-----

As (-2)^0 + (-2)^1 + (-2)^3 = 1 + (-2) + (-8) = -9, 1011 is the base -2 representation of -9.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the base -2 representation of N. We can do this by finding the binary representation of N and then reversing it.

First, we need to find the binary representation of N. We can do this by dividing N by 2 and taking the remainder. We can repeat this process until we reach 0.

For example, if N = -9, we can start by dividing it by 2 to get -9 / 2 = -4 with a remainder of 1. We can then divide -4 by 2 to get -4 / 2 = -2 with a remainder of 0. We can then divide -2 by 2 to get -2 / 2 = -1 with a remainder of 0. Finally, we can divide -1 by 2 to get -1 / 2 = 0 with a remainder of 1.

So, the binary representation of -9 is 1011.

Now, we need to reverse the binary representation to get the base -2 representation of N. We can do this by reversing the order of the digits in the binary representation.

 - 1 \leq N, M \leq 10^5

With 12 yen, we can buy one drink at the first store and four drinks at the second store, for the total of five drinks. However, we cannot buy 5 drinks with 11 yen or less.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum amount of money that Takahashi can spend to buy M cans of energy drinks.

Let's consider the first store. We can buy at most B_1 cans of energy drinks for A_1 yen each. If we buy M cans of energy drinks, we need to spend at least M \* A_1 yen.

Let's consider the second store. We can buy at most B_2 cans of energy drinks for A_2 yen each. If we buy M cans of energy drinks, we need to spend at least M \* A_2 yen.

Since we have N stores, we need to find the minimum amount of money that we can spend to buy M cans of energy drinks from all N stores. We can do this by finding the minimum amount of money that we need to spend to buy M cans of energy drinks from each store.

Let's call the minimum amount of money that we need to spend to buy M cans of energy drinks from each store "x". We can calculate x as follows:

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the maximum number of times you can move from a given square to the right, while maintaining the condition that the height of the next square is not greater than that of the current square.

To solve this problem, you can use a dynamic programming approach. Let dp[i] be the maximum number of times you can move from the i-th square to the right, while maintaining the condition. Then, dp[i] = 1 + dp[i+1] if the height of the i+1-th square is not greater than that of the i-th square, and dp[i] = 0 otherwise.

The base case is dp[N] = 0, since you cannot move from the last square to the right.

The answer is dp[1], which is the maximum number of times you can move from the first square to the right.

In the sample input, the maximum number of times you can move is 2, since you can move from the third square to the right twice.

The only difference between easy and hard versions is the number of elements in the array.

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. In one move you can choose any $a_i$ and divide it by $2$ rounding down (in other words, in one move you can set $a_i := \lfloor\frac{a_i}{2}\rfloor$).

You can perform such an operation any (possibly, zero) number of times with any $a_i$.

Your task is to calculate the minimum possible number of operations required to obtain at least $k$ equal numbers in the array.

Don't forget that it is possible to have $a_i = 0$ after some operations, thus the answer always exists.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in the array and the number of equal numbers required.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of operations required to make at least $k$ elements in the array equal. The only difference between the easy and hard versions is the number of elements in the array.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start with the first element of the array and divide it by 2. If the result is 0, we move on to the next element. If the result is not 0, we repeat the process until we reach the desired number of equal elements.

For example, let's say we have an array of 5 elements and we want to make at least 3 elements equal. We start with the first element and divide it by 2. If the result is 0, we move on to the next element. If the result is not 0, we repeat the process until we reach the desired number of equal elements.

We can use a variable to keep track of the number of equal elements we have reached. If the variable is equal to or greater than $k$, we stop the process. If the variable is less than $k$, we continue the process until we reach the desired number of equal elements.

  Take one of the minimum elements of the array and increase its value by one (more formally, if the minimum value of $a$ is $mn$ then you choose such index $i$ that $a_i = mn$ and set $a_i := a_i + 1$);  take one of the maximum elements of the array and decrease its value by one (more formally, if the maximum value of $a$ is $mx$ then you choose such index $i$ that $a_i = mx$ and set $a_i := a_i - 1$). 

Your task is to calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least $k$ equal elements in the array.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of moves required to make at least $k$ elements equal in an array $a$ of size $n$. The moves are either increasing or decreasing the value of a single element in the array.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can maintain a count of the number of equal elements in the array, and for each move, we can either increase or decrease the value of a single element in the array.

We can start by sorting the array in non-decreasing order. We can then iterate through the array and for each element, we can either increase or decrease its value by 1. We can keep track of the number of equal elements in the array and update it accordingly.

We can continue this process until we have at least $k$ equal elements in the array. The minimum number of moves required to make at least $k$ elements equal in the array is the number of moves required to make all the elements equal.

The time complexity of this approach is $O(n \log n)$ and the space complexity is $O(1)$.

The problem is asking for the number of times the ball will make a bounce where the coordinate is at most X. To solve this problem, we need to find the number of times the ball will make a bounce where the coordinate is less than or equal to X.

We can solve this problem by using a simple algorithm. We can start by finding the maximum value of L_i, which is the distance the ball will travel on the i-th bounce. We can then find the number of times the ball will make a bounce where the coordinate is less than or equal to X by counting the number of times the sum of the distances traveled on each bounce is less than or equal to X.

Shiritori is a game as follows:
 - In the first turn, a player announces any one word.
 - In the subsequent turns, a player announces a word that satisfies the following conditions:
 - That word is not announced before.
 - The first character of that word is the same as the last character of the last word announced.
In this game, he is practicing to announce as many words as possible in ten seconds.
You are given the number of words Takahashi announced, N, and the i-th word he announced, W_i, for each i. Determine if the rules of shiritori was observed, that is, every word announced by him satisfied the conditions.

-----Constraints-----

-----Sample Output-----

As hoge is announced multiple times, the rules of shiritori was not observed.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to check if the words announced by Takahashi satisfy the conditions of the game.

First, we need to check if the first word, W_1, satisfies the condition that it is not announced before. If it is not, then the game is not possible.

Next, we need to check if the second word, W_2, satisfies the condition that its first character is the same as the last character of the last word announced, which is W_1. If it does not satisfy this condition, then the game is not possible.

We continue this process for each word, W_i, until we reach the last word, W_N. If any word does not satisfy the conditions, then the game is not possible.

If all the words satisfy the conditions, then the game is possible. Therefore, we print "Yes" if the game is possible, and "No" if it is not.

A B

-----Output-----
Print the minimum number of pieces that can be evenly distributed to the guests in both of the cases with A guests and B guests.

-----Sample Input-----
2 3

-----Sample Output-----
6

When we have six snack pieces, each guest can take three pieces if we have two guests, and each guest can take two if we have three guests.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the minimum number of snack pieces that can be evenly distributed to a group of guests, where the number of guests is either A or B. The snack pieces cannot be divided and distributed to multiple guests.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of snack pieces that can be evenly distributed to both A and B guests.

Let's consider the case where there are A guests. In this case, we need to find the minimum number of snack pieces that can be evenly distributed to A guests.

We can start by dividing the total number of snack pieces by A. This will give us the number of snack pieces that each guest will receive.

For example, if there are 6 snack pieces and A = 2, then each guest will receive 3 snack pieces.

Now, let's consider the case where there are B guests. In this case, we need to find the minimum number of snack pieces that can be evenly distributed to B guests.

We can start by dividing the total number of snack pieces by B. This will give us the number of snack pieces that each

Given is a string S. Replace every character in S with x and print the result.

-----Constraints-----
 - S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
 - The length of S is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
Replace every character in S with x and print the result.

-----Sample Input-----
sardine

-----Sample Output-----
xxxxxxx

Replacing every character in S with x results in xxxxxxx.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to replace every character in a given string S with the character x. The solution is to iterate through each character in S and replace it with x.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Read the input string S from Standard Input.
2. Create a new string T with the same length as S.
3. Iterate through each character in S and replace it with x.
4. Print the modified string T.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string S. The space complexity is O(n) as well, since we need to create a new string T of the same length as S.

There are N squares arranged in a row from left to right. The height of the i-th square from the left is H_i.
For each square, you will perform either of the following operations once:
 - Decrease the height of the square by 1.
 - Do nothing.
Determine if it is possible to perform the operations so that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq H_i \leq 10^9

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

-----Output-----
If it is possible to perform the operations so that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
5
1 2 1 1 3

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

You can achieve the objective by decreasing the height of only the second square from the left by 1.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking if it is possible to make the heights of the squares non-decreasing from left to right by performing the operations. The operations are either decreasing the height of a square by 1 or doing nothing.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by considering the first square and then iterate through the remaining squares. For each square, we can either decrease the height by 1 or do nothing.

If we decrease the height of a square, we need to make sure that the height of the next square is greater than or equal to the current height. If the next square's height is less than the current height, then we cannot perform the operation and we need to move on to the next square.

If we do nothing, we can simply move on to the next square.

If we are able to perform the operations in this way, then we can print Yes, otherwise we can print No.

For example, in the sample input, we have 5 squares with heights 1, 2, 1, 1, and 3. We can perform the operations as follows:

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of 1000-yen bills required to pay the price N.

Let's break down the problem:

What is the maximum total number of monsters the heroes can cooperate to defeat?

If the heroes choose the monsters to defeat as follows, they can defeat nine monsters in total, which is the maximum result.
 - The first hero defeats two monsters attacking the first town and two monsters attacking the second town.
 - The second hero defeats three monsters attacking the second town and two monsters attacking the third town.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the maximum total number of monsters that can be defeated by the heroes. The heroes can cooperate to defeat the monsters by choosing which monsters to defeat.

The first step is to determine which towns the heroes can attack. Each hero can attack either the i-th town or the (i+1)-th town, for a total of at most B_i monsters. Therefore, the heroes can attack at most B_1 + B_2 +... + B_N towns.

The second step is to determine which monsters the heroes can defeat. Each hero can defeat at most B_i monsters, and there are N+1 towns, so the heroes can defeat at most B_1 + B_2 +... + B_N monsters in total.

The third step is to determine the maximum total number of monsters that can be defeated by the heroes. This is the maximum number of monsters that can be defeated by the heroes, which is the sum of the maximum number of monsters that can be defeated by each hero.

Therefore, the maximum total number of monsters that can be defeated by the hero

Our world is one-dimensional, and ruled by two empires called Empire A and Empire B.
The capital of Empire A is located at coordinate X, and that of Empire B is located at coordinate Y.
One day, Empire A becomes inclined to put the cities at coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_N under its control, and Empire B becomes inclined to put the cities at coordinates y_1, y_2, ..., y_M under its control.
If there exists an integer Z that satisfies all of the following three conditions, they will come to an agreement, but otherwise war will break out.
 - X < Z \leq Y
 - x_1, x_2, ..., x_N < Z
 - y_1, y_2, ..., y_M \geq Z
Determine if war will break out.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N, M \leq 100
 - -100 \leq X < Y \leq 100
 - -100 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 100

The choice Z = 16 satisfies all of the three conditions as follows, thus they will come to an agreement.
 - X = 10 < 16 \leq 20 = Y
 - 8, 15, 13 < 16
 - 16, 22 \geq 16

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to determine if war will break out between two empires, Empire A and Empire B, based on the coordinates of their capitals and the cities they control. The problem is one-dimensional, meaning that the cities are located on a line.

The first line of input contains three integers, N, M, and X, which represent the number of cities controlled by Empire A and Empire B, respectively, and the coordinate of the capital of Empire A, respectively. The next N lines contain the coordinates of the cities controlled by Empire A. The last M lines contain the coordinates of the cities controlled by Empire B.

The problem is asking us to determine if there exists an integer Z that satisfies all of the following three conditions:

1. X < Z \leq Y
2. x_1, x_2,..., x_N < Z
3. y_1, y_2,..., y_M \geq Z

If there exists such an integer Z, then the two empires will come to an agreement. Otherwise, war will break out.

We have N clocks. The hand of the i-th clock (1≤i≤N) rotates through 360° in exactly T_i seconds.

Initially, the hand of every clock stands still, pointing directly upward.

Now, Dolphin starts all the clocks simultaneously.

In how many seconds will the hand of every clock point directly upward again?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1≤N≤100 
 - 1≤T_i≤10^{18} 
 - All input values are integers.  
 - The correct answer is at most 10^{18} seconds.

We have two clocks. The time when the hand of each clock points upward is as follows:
 - Clock 1: 2, 4, 6, ... seconds after the beginning
 - Clock 2: 3, 6, 9, ... seconds after the beginning
Therefore, it takes 6 seconds until the hands of both clocks point directly upward.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the smallest time t such that the hands of all N clocks point directly upward again. We can solve this problem by using the least common multiple (LCM) of the time it takes for each clock to point directly upward.

Let T_i be the time it takes for the i-th clock to point directly upward. We can find the LCM of T_1, T_2,..., T_N using the following formula:

LCM(T_1, T_2,..., T_N) = T_1 \* T_2 \*... \* T_N / GCD(T_1, T_2,..., T_N)

where GCD(T_1, T_2,..., T_N) is the greatest common divisor of T_1, T_2,..., T_N.

In this case, we have N = 2, T_1 = 2, T_2 = 3, so we can calculate the LCM as follows:

LCM(2, 3) = 2 \* 3 / GCD

Consider all possible such divisions and find the minimum possible absolute difference of S_1 and S_2.

If T = 2, S_1 = 1 + 2 = 3 and S_2 = 3, with the absolute difference of 0.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum absolute difference between the sum of the weights of the first T weights and the sum of the weights of the remaining weights.

To solve this problem, we can consider all possible divisions of the weights into two groups, where the first group contains the first T weights and the second group contains the remaining weights.

For each division, we can calculate the sum of the weights in each group and the absolute difference between the two sums. We can then find the minimum absolute difference among all possible divisions.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N^2), since we need to consider all possible divisions of the weights. The space complexity is O(N), since we need to store the weights in an array.

In Python, we can implement this solution as follows:
```
def solve(weights, T):
    # Calculate the sum of the weights in each group
    group1_sum = sum(weights[:T])
    group2_sum = sum(weights[T:])

    # Calculate the absolute difference between the two sums

You are given a rectangular matrix of size $n \times m$ consisting of integers from $1$ to $2 \cdot 10^5$.

In one move, you can:  choose any element of the matrix and change its value to any integer between $1$ and $n \cdot m$, inclusive;  take any column and shift it one cell up cyclically (see the example of such cyclic shift below). 

A cyclic shift is an operation such that you choose some $j$ ($1 \le j \le m$) and set $a_{1, j} := a_{2, j}, a_{2, j} := a_{3, j}, \dots, a_{n, j} := a_{1, j}$ simultaneously. [Image] Example of cyclic shift of the first column 

You want to perform the minimum number of moves to make this matrix look like this: $\left. \begin{array}{|c c c c|} \hline 1 & {2} & {\ldots} & {m} \\{m + 1} & {m + 2} & {\ldots} & {2m} \\{\vdots} & {\vdots} & {\ddots} & {\vdots} \\{(n - 1) m + 1} & {(n - 1) m + 2} & {\ldots} & {nm} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$ 

In other words, the goal is to obtain the matrix, where $a_{1, 1} = 1, a_{1, 2} = 2, \dots, a_{1, m} = m, a_{2, 1} = m + 1, a_{2, 2} = m + 2, \dots, a_{n, m} = n \cdot m$ (i.e. $a_{i, j} = (i - 1) \cdot m + j$) with the minimum number of moves performed.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5, n \cdot m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the size of the matrix.

The next $n$ lines contain $m$ integers each. The number at the line $i$ and position $j$ is $a_{i, j}$ ($1 \le a_{i, j} \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum number of moves required to obtain the matrix, where $a_{1, 1} = 1, a_{1, 2} = 2, \dots, a_{1, m} = m, a_{2, 1} = m + 1, a_{2, 2} = m + 2, \dots, a_{n, m} = n \cdot m$ ($a_{i, j} = (i - 1)m + j$).

-----Note-----

In the first example, you can set $a_{1, 1} := 7, a_{1, 2} := 8$ and $a_{1, 3} := 9$ then shift the first, the second and the third columns cyclically, so the answer is $6$. It can be shown that you cannot achieve a better answer.

In the second example, the matrix is already good so the answer is $0$.

In the third example, it is enough to shift the second column cyclically twice to obtain a good matrix, so the answer is $2$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of moves required to transform a given rectangular matrix into a specific target matrix. The matrix is described by its size $n \times m$ and its elements $a_{i, j}$ ($1 \le i, j \le n, m$). The goal is to obtain the target matrix, where $a_{1, 1} = 1, a_{1, 2} = 2, \dots, a_{1, m} = m, a_{2, 1} = m + 1, a_{2, 2} = m + 2, \dots, a_{n, m} = n \cdot m$ ($a_{i, j} = (i - 1)m + j$).

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can define a function $f(i, j)$ that represents the minimum number of moves required to transform the submatrix $A[1..i, 1..j]$ into the target matrix.

We can use the following recurrence relation to compute $f(i, j)$:

$$f(i, j) = \min\left

There are $n$ students in a university. The number of students is even. The $i$-th student has programming skill equal to $a_i$. 

The coach wants to form $\frac{n}{2}$ teams. Each team should consist of exactly two students, and each student should belong to exactly one team. Two students can form a team only if their skills are equal (otherwise they cannot understand each other and cannot form a team).

Students can solve problems to increase their skill. One solved problem increases the skill by one.

The coach wants to know the minimum total number of problems students should solve to form exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ teams (i.e. each pair of students should form a team). Your task is to find this number.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of students. It is guaranteed that $n$ is even.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$), where $a_i$ is the skill of the $i$-th student.

5 10 2 3 14 5

1 100

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example the optimal teams will be: $(3, 4)$, $(1, 6)$ and $(2, 5)$, where numbers in brackets are indices of students. Then, to form the first team the third student should solve $1$ problem, to form the second team nobody needs to solve problems and to form the third team the second student should solve $4$ problems so the answer is $1 + 4 = 5$.

In the second example the first student should solve $99$ problems to form a team with the second one.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of problems that each student should solve to form exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ teams, where $n$ is even and the $i$-th student has programming skill equal to $a_i$.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We can start by sorting the students in non-decreasing order of their programming skills.

Let $i$ be the index of the $i$-th student. We can form teams with students $i$ and $i+1$ if their skills are equal. We can also form teams with students $i$ and $i+2$ if their skills are equal.

We can repeat this process until we have formed all the teams. The total number of problems that each student should solve is the sum of the number of problems that each student should solve to form a team.

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n\log n)$ because we need to sort the students in non-decreasing order of their programming skills. The space complexity is $O(1)$ because we only need to store the sorted array of students.

The algorithm is correct because we have shown that

Each day in Berland consists of $n$ hours. Polycarp likes time management. That's why he has a fixed schedule for each day — it is a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ (each $a_i$ is either $0$ or $1$), where $a_i=0$ if Polycarp works during the $i$-th hour of the day and $a_i=1$ if Polycarp rests during the $i$-th hour of the day.

In the second example, Polycarp has maximal rest from the $4$-th to the $5$-th hour.

In the third example, Polycarp has maximal rest from the $3$-rd to the $5$-th hour.

In the fourth example, Polycarp has no rest at all.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the maximum number of continuous hours during which Polycarp rests. The input is a sequence of $n$ integers, where each integer is either $0$ or $1$, indicating whether the corresponding hour is a rest hour or a working hour. The goal is to find the maximum number of continuous rest hours.

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window technique. We can maintain a window of size $n$ that contains the current sequence of rest hours. We can start the window at the beginning of the sequence and move it forward one hour at a time. At each step, we check if the current window contains the maximum number of continuous rest hours. If it does, we update the maximum number of continuous rest hours.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Initialize the window to contain the first $n$ hours of the sequence.
2. Check if the current window contains the maximum number of continuous rest hours. If it does, update the maximum number of continuous rest hours.
3. Move the window forward one hour.
4. Repeat step 2 until the end of the sequence is reached.

Little Petya wanted to give an April Fools Day present to some scientists. After some hesitation he decided to give them the array that he got as a present in Codeforces Round #153 (Div.2). The scientists rejoiced at the gift and decided to put some important facts to this array. Here are the first few of the facts: The highest mountain above sea level in the world is Mount Everest. Its peak rises to 8848 m.  The largest board game tournament consisted of 958 participants playing chapaev. The largest online maths competition consisted of 12766 participants. The Nile is credited as the longest river in the world. From its farthest stream in Burundi, it extends 6695 km in length. While not in flood, the main stretches of the Amazon river in South America can reach widths of up to 1100 km at its widest points. Angel Falls is the highest waterfall. Its greatest single drop measures 807 m. The Hotel Everest View above Namche, Nepal — the village closest to Everest base camp – is at a record height of 31962 m Uranium is the heaviest of all the naturally occurring elements. Its most common isotope has a nucleus containing 146 neutrons. The coldest permanently inhabited place is the Siberian village of Oymyakon, where the temperature of -68°C was registered in the twentieth century. The longest snake held in captivity is over 25 feet long. Its name is Medusa. Colonel Meow holds the world record for longest fur on a cat — almost 134 centimeters. Sea otters can have up to 10000 hairs per square inch. This is the most dense fur in the animal kingdom. The largest state of USA is Alaska; its area is 663268 square miles Alaska has a longer coastline than all of the other 49 U.S. States put together: it is 154103 miles long. Lake Baikal is the largest freshwater lake in the world. It reaches 1642 meters in depth and contains around one-fifth of the world’s unfrozen fresh water. The most colorful national flag is the one of Turkmenistan, with 106 colors.

The problem is asking you to find the number of facts that are true for a given input. The input is an integer between 1 and 16, and the output is a single integer that represents the number of facts that are true.

To solve this problem, you need to go through the list of facts and check which ones are true for the given input. You can use a loop to iterate through the facts and check each one. If a fact is true, you can increment a counter to keep track of the number of true facts.

Here's an example of how you can solve this problem:
```
def solve(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i == 1:
            count += 1

-----Input-----

The first line of input contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) — the number of cheeses you have.

The next N lines describe the cheeses you have. Each line contains two space-separated strings: the name of the cheese and its type. The name is a string of lowercase English letters between 1 and 10 characters long. The type is either "soft" or "hard. All cheese names are distinct.


-----Output-----

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of different types of cheese you have.

To solve this problem, we need to read in the input, which consists of a number of lines, each describing a cheese. Each line contains the name of the cheese and its type, which is either "soft" or "hard".

We can store the names and types of the cheeses in a data structure, such as a dictionary or a list of tuples. We can then iterate through the list of cheeses and count the number of different types of cheese.

Once we have counted the number of different types of cheese, we can output the result.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Python:
```
cheeses = []

# Read in the input
for _ in range(int(input())):
    cheeses.append(input().split())

# Count the number of different types of cheese
types = set()
for cheese in cheeses:
    types.add(cheese[1])

# Output the result
print(len(types))

You are given two arrays $a$ and $b$, both of length $n$. All elements of both arrays are from $0$ to $n-1$.

You can reorder elements of the array $b$ (if you want, you may leave the order of elements as it is). After that, let array $c$ be the array of length $n$, the $i$-th element of this array is $c_i = (a_i + b_i) \% n$, where $x \% y$ is $x$ modulo $y$.

Your task is to reorder elements of the array $b$ to obtain the lexicographically minimum possible array $c$.

Array $x$ of length $n$ is lexicographically less than array $y$ of length $n$, if there exists such $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$), that $x_i < y_i$, and for any $j$ ($1 \le j < i$) $x_j = y_j$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in $a$, $b$ and $c$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i < n$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.

The third line of the input contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$ ($0 \le b_i < n$), where $b_i$ is the $i$-th element of $b$.


-----Output-----

Print the lexicographically minimum possible array $c$. Recall that your task is to reorder elements of the array $b$ and obtain the lexicographically minimum possible array $c$, where the $i$-th element of $c$ is $c_i = (a_i + b_i) \% n$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the lexicographically minimum possible array $c$ such that the $i$-th element of $c$ is $(a_i + b_i) \% n$, where $a$ and $b$ are two given arrays of length $n$. The goal is to reorder the elements of $b$ to obtain the lexicographically minimum possible array $c$.

To solve this problem, we can first sort the elements of $b$ in non-decreasing order. Then, we can iterate through the elements of $b$ and update the corresponding elements of $c$ accordingly.

Let $c_i$ be the $i$-th element of $c$. We have $c_i = (a_i + b_i) \% n$. Since $a$ and $b$ are both arrays of length $n$, we know that $a_i$ and $b_i$ are both between $0$ and $n-1$. Therefore, we can compute $c_i$ as follows:

$$c_i = (a_i + b_i) \% n = (a_i + b_i)

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the majority element in an array of 4 elements. The majority element is an element that appears more than half of the time in the array.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm called the "Boyer-Moore majority vote" algorithm. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize a counter to 0.
2. For each element in the array, if the element is 0, increment the counter by 1. If the element is 1, decrement the counter by 1.
3. If the counter is greater than 0, the majority element is 0. If the counter is less than 0, the majority element is 1.

In the example input, the counter starts at 0. When we encounter the first 0, we increment the counter by 1, so the counter is now 1. When we encounter the second 1, we decrement the counter by 1, so the counter is now 0. Since the counter is 0, the majority element is 0.

Therefore, the output is 0.

They have planned to meet at a place that is D meters away from Takahashi's house in T minutes from now.
Takahashi will leave his house now and go straight to the place at a speed of S meters per minute.
Will he arrive in time?

 - 1 \leq D \leq 10000
 - 1 \leq T \leq 10000
 - 1 \leq S \leq 10000
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----

D T S

-----Output-----
If Takahashi will reach the place in time, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
1000 15 80

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

It takes 12.5 minutes to go 1000 meters to the place at a speed of 80 meters per minute. They have planned to meet in 15 minutes so he will arrive in time.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Takahashi to reach the place. We know that he will leave his house now and go straight to the place at a speed of S meters per minute. We also know that he will meet Aoki at a place that is D meters away from Takahashi's house in T minutes from now.

We can calculate the time it takes for Takahashi to reach the place by dividing the distance by the speed. We get:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is D meters and the speed is S meters per minute. We can plug these values into the formula to get:

Time = D / S

We know that Takahashi will meet Aoki at a place that is D meters away from Takahashi's house in T minutes from now. We can calculate the time it takes for Takahashi to reach the place by subtracting the time it takes for him to reach the house from the total time he has to meet Aoki. We get:

Time to reach place = T - (D / S)

We can simplify this expression by multiplying both sides by S to

Determine whether we will have a bingo when the N numbers are chosen, that is, the sheet will contain three marked numbers in a row, column, or diagonal.

-----Constraints-----

We will mark A_{1, 1}, A_{2, 1}, A_{2, 2}, A_{3, 3}, and complete the diagonal from the top-left to the bottom-right.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to check if there are three marked numbers in a row, column, or diagonal on the bingo card.

We can do this by keeping track of the numbers that have been marked on the card. When a number is chosen by the MC, we check if it is already marked on the card. If it is, we mark it again. If it is not, we mark it and check if it is part of a row, column, or diagonal that contains three marked numbers.

We can use a 2D array to keep track of the numbers that have been marked on the card. The array will have a size of 100 x 100, since the maximum value of A_{i, j} is 100.

We can use a for loop to iterate through the numbers that have been chosen by the MC. For each number, we check if it is already marked on the card. If it is, we mark it again. If it is not, we mark it and check if it is part of a row, column, or diagonal that contains three marked numbers.

For example, he can do the first assignment on the first 5 days, hang out on the next 30 days, and do the second assignment on the last 6 days of the vacation. In this way, he can safely spend 30 days hanging out.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the maximum number of days Takahashi can spend hanging out during his summer vacation if he finishes all his summer assignments. The constraints are that he has N days of vacation, M summer assignments, and each assignment takes A_i days to complete.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of days Takahashi can hang out during his vacation while still completing all his assignments. We can do this by finding the minimum number of days he needs to spend on each assignment.

Let's say he needs to complete the first assignment in A_1 days. If he spends A_1 days on the first assignment, he will have N - A_1 days left for hanging out. If he spends A_2 days on the second assignment, he will have N - A_1 - A_2 days left for hanging out.

We can continue this process for each assignment, finding the minimum number of days he needs to spend on each assignment. Let's call this minimum number of days for each assignment "x_i".

We can then find the maximum number of days Takahashi can hang out by adding

As the name of the contest is AtCoder Beginner Contest 100, Ringo would be happy if he is given a positive integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times.
Find the N-th smallest integer that would make Ringo happy.

-----Constraints-----

 - N is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
D N

-----Output-----

-----Sample Output-----
5

The integers that can be divided by 100 exactly 0 times (that is, not divisible by 100) are as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...

Thus, the 5-th smallest integer that would make Ringo happy is 5.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times.

If D is 0, then the integer must be divisible by 100 exactly 0 times, which means it must be a multiple of 100. The smallest such integer is 100, and the N-th smallest integer is 100.

If D is 1, then the integer must be divisible by 100 exactly 1 time, which means it must be a multiple of 10. The smallest such integer is 10, and the N-th smallest integer is 10.

If D is 2, then the integer must be divisible by 100 exactly 2 times, which means it must be a multiple of 1000. The smallest such integer is 1000, and the N-th smallest integer is 1000.

Therefore, the N-th smallest integer that would make Ringo happy is 100 if D is 0, 10 if D is 1, and 1000 if

First, student number 3 entered the classroom.
Then, student number 1 entered the classroom.
Finally, student number 2 entered the classroom.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to reconstruct the order in which the students entered the classroom based on the information provided in the input.

We are given N students, each with a unique student number from 1 to N. We are also given the number of students in the classroom when each student entered the classroom, including the student number of the student who entered the classroom.

We can start by sorting the input based on the student number of the student who entered the classroom. This will give us the order in which the students entered the classroom.

For example, if the input is:

3
2 3 1

We can sort the input as follows:

1 2 3

This means that student number 1 entered the classroom first, followed by student number 2, and finally student number 3.

Therefore, the output should be:

3 1 2

This is the order in which the students entered the classroom.

-----Sample Input-----
10 7 100

-----Sample Output-----

The integer 9 is sold for 10 \times 9 + 7 \times 1 = 97 yen, and this is the greatest integer that can be bought.
Some of the other integers are sold for the following prices:
 - 10: 10 \times 10 + 7 \times 2 = 114 yen
 - 100: 10 \times 100 + 7 \times 3 = 1021 yen
 - 12345: 10 \times 12345 + 7 \times 5 = 123485 yen

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the largest integer that can be bought by Takahashi when he has X yen. The shop sells integers from 1 to 10^9, and the price of each integer is A times the integer plus B times the number of digits in the decimal notation of the integer.

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest integer that can be bought when we have X yen. We can do this by finding the largest integer that is less than or equal to X, and then checking if it can be bought.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Find the largest integer that is less than or equal to X. This can be done by finding the largest integer that is less than or equal to X divided by (A + B).
2. Check if the largest integer found in step 1 can be bought. This can be done by checking if the price of the integer is less than or equal to X.
3. If the integer can be bought, print it. If it cannot be bought, print 0.

The problem is asking us to find the number of friends of Takahashi who can ride the roller coaster. The roller coaster requires a minimum height of K centimeters to ride. The height of each friend is given in the input.

We can solve this problem by using a simple algorithm. We can iterate through each friend and check if their height is greater than or equal to K. If it is, we can increment a counter to keep track of the number of friends who can ride the roller coaster.

Here's the pseudocode for the solution:

1. Read the input: N, K, and the heights of each friend.
2. Initialize a counter to 0.
3. Iterate through each friend:
	* If the height of the current friend is greater than or equal to K, increment the counter.
4. Print the value of the counter.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of friends. The space complexity is O(1), as we only need to keep track of the counter.

We have held a popularity poll for N items on sale. Item i received A_i votes.
From these N items, we will select M as popular items. However, we cannot select an item with less than \dfrac{1}{4M} of the total number of votes.
If M popular items can be selected, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq M \leq N \leq 100
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 1000
 - A_i are distinct.
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 ... A_N

-----Output-----
If M popular items can be selected, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
4 1
5 4 2 1

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

There were 12 votes in total. The most popular item received 5 votes, and we can select it.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to determine if we can select M popular items from a set of N items, where each item has a vote count. The catch is that we cannot select an item with less than 1/4M of the total number of votes.

To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of votes. We can do this by summing up the vote counts for each item. Let's call this total number of votes T.

Next, we need to find the number of votes for the most popular item. We can do this by finding the item with the highest vote count and then counting the number of votes for that item. Let's call this number of votes for the most popular item M.

Now, we need to check if we can select M popular items. We can do this by checking if the total number of votes is at least 4M. If the total number of votes is less than 4M, then we cannot select M popular items.

So, the solution is to first find the total number of votes and the number of votes for the most popular item. Then, we can check if we can select M popular items. If we can, then we

We have a grid of H rows and W columns of squares. The color of the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left (1 \leq i \leq H, 1 \leq j \leq W) is given to you as a character c_{i,j}: the square is white if c_{i,j} is ., and black if c_{i,j} is #.
Consider doing the following operation:
 - Choose some number of rows (possibly zero), and some number of columns (possibly zero). Then, paint red all squares in the chosen rows and all squares in the chosen columns.
You are given a positive integer K. How many choices of rows and columns result in exactly K black squares remaining after the operation? Here, we consider two choices different when there is a row or column chosen in only one of those choices.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq H, W \leq 6
 - 1 \leq K \leq HW
 - c_{i,j} is . or #.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H W K

Five choices below satisfy the condition.

 - The 1-st row and 3-rd column
 - The 1-st and 2-nd column
 - The 3-rd column

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the number of ways to choose rows and columns such that exactly K black squares remain after the operation.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to choose rows and columns such that the number of black squares in the chosen rows and columns is equal to K.

Let's consider a few examples to understand the problem better:

* If K = 0, then there is only one way to choose rows and columns: choose no rows and no columns.
* If K = 1, then there are two ways to choose rows and columns: choose the 1-st row and the 1-st column, or choose the 2-nd row and the 2-nd column.
* If K = 2, then there are three ways to choose rows and columns: choose the 1-st row and the 1-st column, choose the 1-st row and the 2-nd column, or choose the 2-nd row and the 2-nd column.

In general, the number of ways to choose rows and columns such that the number of black squares in the chosen rows and columns is equal to K is

-----Output-----
Print the minimum possible value of (i \times j) \mbox{ mod } 2019 when i and j are chosen under the given condition.

-----Sample Input-----
2020 2040

-----Sample Output-----
2

When (i, j) = (2020, 2021), (i \times j) \mbox{ mod } 2019  = 2.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum value of (i \times j) mod 2019, where i and j are integers between L and R, inclusive.

To solve this problem, we can use a brute force approach. We can iterate through all possible values of i and j, and calculate (i \times j) mod 2019 for each pair. We can then keep track of the minimum value we have seen so far, and print it when we are done.

Here is a step-by-step description of the solution:

1. Read the input: The first line of input contains two integers L and R, which are the lower and upper bounds of the range of values for i and j.
2. Initialize the minimum value: Set the minimum value to a large number, such as 2019.
3. Iterate through all possible values of i and j: Iterate through all possible values of i and j, where L <= i < j <= R.

-----Output-----
If S satisfies all of the conditions in the problem statement, print AC; otherwise, print WA.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----

The first letter is A, the third letter is C and the remaining letters are all lowercase, so all the conditions are satisfied.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to check if the given string S satisfies all the conditions mentioned in the problem statement.

First, we need to check if the initial character of S is an uppercase A. We can do this by checking if the first character of S is 'A'.

Next, we need to check if there is exactly one occurrence of C between the third character from the beginning and the second to last character (inclusive). We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of 'C' in the string. If the count is 1, then we have exactly one occurrence of 'C'.

Finally, we need to check if all the letters except the A and C mentioned above are lowercase. We can do this by checking if all the characters in the string are lowercase.

If all the conditions are satisfied, then we print AC. Otherwise, we print WA.

Here is the pseudocode for the solution:

1. Check if the first character of S is 'A'.
2. Count the number of occurrences of 'C' in the string.

Mr. Infinity has a string S consisting of digits from 1 to 9. Each time the date changes, this string changes as follows:
 - Each occurrence of 2 in S is replaced with 22. Similarly, each 3 becomes 333, 4 becomes 4444, 5 becomes 55555, 6 becomes 666666, 7 becomes 7777777, 8 becomes 88888888 and 9 becomes 999999999. 1 remains as 1.
For example, if S is 1324, it becomes 1333224444 the next day, and it becomes 133333333322224444444444444444 the day after next.
You are interested in what the string looks like after 5 \times 10^{15} days. What is the K-th character from the left in the string after 5 \times 10^{15} days?

-----Constraints-----
 - S is a string of length between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
 - K is an integer between 1 and 10^{18} (inclusive).
 - The length of the string after 5 \times 10^{15} days is at least K.

 - Now: 1214
 - After one day: 12214444
 - After two days: 1222214444444444444444

The first five characters in the string after 5 \times 10^{15} days is 12222. As K=4, we should print the fourth character, 2.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the K-th character from the left in Mr. Infinity's string after 5 \times 10^{15} days.

First, we need to understand how the string changes. Each occurrence of 2 in S is replaced with 22, each 3 becomes 333, and so on.

Now, let's find the length of the string after 5 \times 10^{15} days. We can do this by counting the number of times each digit appears in the string.

For example, if S is 1324, it becomes 1333224444 the next day, and it becomes 133333333322224444444444444444 the day after next.

-----Sample Output-----

You can sort p in ascending order by swapping p_1 and p_5.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to determine if it is possible to sort a given permutation of the numbers 1 to N in ascending order by performing at most one swap operation.

To solve this problem, you can use a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start with the first element of the permutation and compare it to the next element. If the next element is smaller, then you can swap them. If the next element is larger, then you cannot swap them.

After the first swap, you can continue comparing the next element to the next element after that, and so on. If you reach the end of the permutation without swapping any elements, then you can print YES, because you have sorted the permutation in ascending order.

If you reach the end of the permutation and you have not swapped any elements, then you can print NO, because you cannot sort the permutation in ascending order.

Here is an example of how you can implement this algorithm:
```
def sort_permutation(p):
    # Start with the first element of the permutation
    i = 0

Polycarp likes numbers that are divisible by 3.

He has a huge number $s$. Polycarp wants to cut from it the maximum number of numbers that are divisible by $3$. To do this, he makes an arbitrary number of vertical cuts between pairs of adjacent digits. As a result, after $m$ such cuts, there will be $m+1$ parts in total. Polycarp analyzes each of the obtained numbers and finds the number of those that are divisible by $3$.

For example, if the original number is $s=3121$, then Polycarp can cut it into three parts with two cuts: $3|1|21$. As a result, he will get two numbers that are divisible by $3$.

Polycarp can make an arbitrary number of vertical cuts, where each cut is made between a pair of adjacent digits. The resulting numbers cannot contain extra leading zeroes (that is, the number can begin with 0 if and only if this number is exactly one character '0'). For example, 007, 01 and 00099 are not valid numbers, but 90, 0 and 10001 are valid.

What is the maximum number of numbers divisible by $3$ that Polycarp can obtain?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer $s$. The number of digits of the number $s$ is between $1$ and $2\cdot10^5$, inclusive. The first (leftmost) digit is not equal to 0.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum number of numbers divisible by $3$ that Polycarp can get by making vertical cuts in the given number $s$.

-----Note-----

In the first example, an example set of optimal cuts on the number is 3|1|21.

In the second example, you do not need to make any cuts. The specified number 6 forms one number that is divisible by $3$.

In the third example, cuts must be made between each pair of digits. As a result, Polycarp gets one digit 1 and $33$ digits 0. Each of the $33$ digits 0 forms a number that is divisible by $3$.

In the fourth example, an example set of optimal cuts is 2|0|1|9|201|81. The numbers $0$, $9$, $201$ and $81$ are divisible by $3$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the maximum number of numbers that can be obtained by cutting a given number $s$ into parts, where each part is divisible by 3.

To solve this problem, we can start by analyzing the number $s$ and finding the number of digits that are divisible by 3. We can do this by counting the number of digits that are either 3, 6, 9, or 12.

For example, if the number $s$ is 3121, we can see that the number 3 is divisible by 3, and the numbers 6, 9, and 12 are not divisible by 3. Therefore, the number of digits that are divisible by 3 in $s$ is 1.

Next, we can consider the number of parts that we can obtain by cutting $s$ into parts. We can do this by making vertical cuts between pairs of adjacent digits. For example, if we cut $s$ into parts with two cuts, we can obtain two parts: 312 and 1. Each of these parts is divisible by 3, so we have obtained two numbers that

In the fourth example, we may choose $d = 6$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum number of zeroes in an array $c$ that is created by multiplying two other arrays $a$ and $b$ by a real number $d$. The goal is to maximize the number of zeroes in $c$.

To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal value of $d$ that maximizes the number of zeroes in $c$.

Let's consider the value of $d$ that maximizes the number of zeroes in $c$. We can see that if $d$ is a positive integer, then the product $d \cdot a_i + b_i$ will always be non-zero, so the number of zeroes in $c$ will be zero.

On the other hand, if $d$ is a negative integer, then the product $d \cdot a_i + b_i$ will be zero if and only if $a_i$ is an integer multiple of $d$. Therefore, the number of zeroes in $c$ will be equal to the number of elements in $a$ that are integer multiples of $d$.

Therefore, the optimal value of $d$ is the

There are $n$ left boots and $n$ right boots. Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $l$ and $r$, both of length $n$. The character $l_i$ stands for the color of the $i$-th left boot and the character $r_i$ stands for the color of the $i$-th right boot.

A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.

For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').

Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.

Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.


-----Input-----

The first line contains $n$ ($1 \le n \le 150000$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).

The second line contains the string $l$ of length $n$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $i$-th character stands for the color of the $i$-th left boot.

The third line contains the string $r$ of length $n$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $i$-th character stands for the color of the $i$-th right boot.


-----Output-----

Print $k$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.

The $j$-th of these lines should contain the index $a_j$ of the left boot in the $j$-th pair and index $b_j$ of the right boot in the $j$-th pair. All the numbers $a_j$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $b_j$ should be distinct (unique).

-----Plan-----
This problem is a classic problem in combinatorics, known as the "Colored Boots" problem. The problem is to find the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.

To solve this problem, we need to first understand the concept of compatibility between colors. A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.

For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').

Once we understand the concept of compatibility, we can start solving the problem. We can start by creating a matrix of size $n \times n$, where $n$ is the number of boots. Each element of the matrix represents the compatibility between two boots. If two boots are compatible, then the corresponding element in

You are given an array of integers $a[1], a[2], \dots, a[n].$ A block is a sequence of contiguous (consecutive) elements $a[l], a[l+1], \dots, a[r]$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$). Thus, a block is defined by a pair of indices $(l, r)$.

Find a set of blocks $(l_1, r_1), (l_2, r_2), \dots, (l_k, r_k)$ such that:  They do not intersect (i.e. they are disjoint). Formally, for each pair of blocks $(l_i, r_i)$ and $(l_j, r_j$) where $i \neq j$ either $r_i < l_j$ or $r_j < l_i$.  For each block the sum of its elements is the same.

-----Plan-----
This problem is a classic problem in combinatorics, known as the "Partition Problem". The goal is to partition a set of $n$ elements into a maximum number of blocks such that each block has the same sum.

The solution to this problem is to use a greedy algorithm. We start by sorting the elements in non-decreasing order. Then, we start with the first element and add it to the current block. We continue adding elements to the current block until we reach the end of the array or until we reach an element that is not equal to the current block's sum. If we reach the end of the array, we add the current block to the set of blocks.

We repeat this process until we have added all the elements to the set of blocks. The final set of blocks is the solution to the problem.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. Sort the elements in non-decreasing order.
2. Initialize the current block to be empty.
3. For each element in the array, do the following:
	* If the element is not equal to the current block's sum, add it to the current block.

You are given an array $a$, consisting of $n$ positive integers.

Let's call a concatenation of numbers $x$ and $y$ the number that is obtained by writing down numbers $x$ and $y$ one right after another without changing the order. For example, a concatenation of numbers $12$ and $3456$ is a number $123456$.

Count the number of ordered pairs of positions $(i, j)$ ($i \neq j$) in array $a$ such that the concatenation of $a_i$ and $a_j$ is divisible by $k$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the number of ordered pairs of positions $(i, j)$ ($i \neq j$) in array $a$ such that the concatenation of $a_i$ and $a_j$ is divisible by $k$.

-----Note-----

In the first example pairs $(1, 2)$, $(1, 3)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 1)$, $(3, 4)$, $(4, 2)$, $(4, 3)$ suffice. They produce numbers $451$, $4510$, $110$, $1045$, $1012$, $121$, $1210$, respectively, each of them is divisible by $11$.

In the second example all $n(n - 1)$ pairs suffice.

In the third example no pair is sufficient.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of ordered pairs of positions $(i, j)$ ($i \neq j$) in an array $a$ such that the concatenation of $a_i$ and $a_j$ is divisible by $k$.

To solve this problem, we can use a brute force approach. We can iterate through all possible pairs of positions $(i, j)$ and check if the concatenation of $a_i$ and $a_j$ is divisible by $k$. If it is, we increment a counter.

The time complexity of this approach is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the array. The space complexity is $O(1)$, since we only need to store a single counter.

However, this approach is not efficient for large inputs. A more efficient approach would be to use a hash table to keep track of the divisibility of each number by $k$. We can iterate through the array once and for each number, we can check if it is divisible by $k$ and if so, we can increment a counter.

The time complexity of this approach is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the

A can be, for example, ( 2 , 1 , 5 ), ( -1 , -2 , -3 ), or ( 2 , 2 , 5 ). Among those candidates, A = ( 2 , 2 , 5 ) has the maximum possible sum.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum possible sum of the elements of a sequence A of length N, where the sequence B of length N-1 is known to satisfy the constraint that B_i ≥ max(A_i, A_{i+1}).

To solve this problem, we can start by considering the first element of A, which is A_1. Since B_1 ≥ max(A_1, A_2), we know that A_1 ≤ B_1. Therefore, the maximum possible sum of the elements of A is at most B_1 + A_2 +... + A_N.

Now, let's consider the second element of A, which is A_2. Since B_2 ≥ max(A_2, A_3), we know that A_2 ≤ B_2. Therefore, the maximum possible sum of the elements of A is at most B_1 + B_2 + A_3 +... + A_N.

We can continue this process for each element of A, considering the constraint that B_i ≥ max(A_i, A_{i+1}). This means that the maximum possible sum of

Given are positive integers N, M, Q, and Q quadruples of integers ( a_i , b_i , c_i , d_i ).
Consider a sequence A satisfying the following conditions:
 - A is a sequence of N positive integers.
 - 1 \leq A_1 \leq A_2 \le \cdots \leq A_N \leq M.
Let us define a score of this sequence as follows:
 - The score is the sum of d_i over all indices i such that A_{b_i} - A_{a_i} = c_i. (If there is no such i, the score is 0.)
Find the maximum possible score of A.

-----Constraints-----

 - 2 ≤ N ≤ 10

When A = \{1, 3, 4\}, its score is 110. Under these conditions, no sequence has a score greater than 110, so the answer is 110.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the maximum possible score of a sequence A, given that it satisfies certain conditions. The conditions are as follows:

* A is a sequence of N positive integers.
* 1 <= A_1 <= A_2 <=... <= A_N <= M.
* Let us define a score of this sequence as the sum of d_i over all indices i such that A_{b_i} - A_{a_i} = c_i. If there is no such i, the score is 0.

The input consists of four lines:

* The first line contains three integers N, M, and Q, separated by spaces.
* The second line contains Q quadruples of integers (a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i), separated by spaces.

The output is a single integer, the maximum possible score of A.

-----Sample Output-----

The maximum absolute difference of two elements is A_3-A_1=6-1=5.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum absolute difference between two elements in the array A. We can do this by iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum absolute difference we have seen so far.

We start by initializing a variable maxDiff to 0, which will store the maximum absolute difference we have seen so far. We then iterate through the array A, starting from the first element. For each element A_i, we compare it to the previous element A_i-1. If the absolute difference between the two elements is greater than maxDiff, we update maxDiff to the new maximum absolute difference.

We continue this process until we have iterated through the entire array. At the end, we return the maximum absolute difference we have seen, which is stored in the variable maxDiff.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the length of the array A. The space complexity is O(1), since we only need to keep track of the maximum absolute difference we have seen so far.

There are N towns in a coordinate plane. Town i is located at coordinates (x_i, y_i). The distance between Town i and Town j is \sqrt{\left(x_i-x_j\right)^2+\left(y_i-y_j\right)^2}.
There are N! possible paths to visit all of these towns once. Let the length of a path be the distance covered when we start at the first town in the path, visit the second, third, \dots, towns, and arrive at the last town (assume that we travel in a straight line from a town to another). Compute the average length of these N! paths.

-----Sample Output-----

There are six paths to visit the towns: 1 → 2 → 3, 1 → 3 → 2, 2 → 1 → 3, 2 → 3 → 1, 3 → 1 → 2, and 3 → 2 → 1.
The length of the path 1 → 2 → 3 is \sqrt{\left(0-1\right)^2+\left(0-0\right)^2} + \sqrt{\left(1-0\right)^2+\left(0-1\right)^2} = 1+\sqrt{2}.
By calculating the lengths of the other paths in this way, we see that the average length of all routes is:
\frac{\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)+\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)+\left(2\right)+\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)+\left(2\right)+\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)}{6} = 2.276142...

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average length of all possible paths that visit all N towns.

First, we need to calculate the distance between each pair of towns. We can do this by calculating the Euclidean distance between each pair of towns, which is given by the formula:

distance = sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)

where x1, y1, x2, and y2 are the coordinates of the two towns.

Next, we need to calculate the length of each path. We can do this by summing up the distances between each pair of towns in the path. For example, if we have a path that goes from town 1 to town 2 to town 3, the length of the path would be:

distance(1, 2) + distance(2, 3)

We can calculate the average length of all possible paths by dividing the sum of the lengths of all paths by the number of possible paths.

The number of possible paths is N! (N factorial), which is equal to N × (N - 1) × (N - 2) ×...

We have a window with a horizontal length of 12, and two curtains, each of length 4, that cover both ends of the window, for example. The uncovered part has a horizontal length of 4.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum horizontal length of the uncovered part of the window.

Let's call the horizontal length of the uncovered part of the window "x".

We know that the total horizontal length of the uncovered part of the window is equal to the horizontal length of the window minus the sum of the horizontal lengths of the two curtains.

So, we can write the equation:

x + B = A

where B is the horizontal length of one of the curtains.

We can solve for x by subtracting B from both sides of the equation:

x = A - B

So, the total horizontal length of the uncovered part of the window is equal to A - B.

Therefore, the output is A - B.

The problem is asking for the minimum value of the function F(A,B) over all pairs of positive integers (A,B) such that N = A \* B.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum value of F(A,B) as (A,B) ranges over all pairs of positive integers such that N = A \* B.

Let's first define the function F(A,B):

F(A,B) = max(log10(A), log10(B))

where log10(x) is the base-10 logarithm of x.

Now, let's find the minimum value of F(A,B) as (A,B) ranges over all pairs of positive integers such that N = A \* B.

We know that N = A \* B, so we can write:

log10(N) = log10(A) + log10(B)

We also know that log10(A) and log10(B) are both non-negative, so we can take the maximum of them:

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the probability that Takahashi chooses an odd integer when choosing an integer from the positive integers not greater than N with equal probability.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of odd integers in the set of positive integers not greater than N.

Let's first consider the case where N is odd. In this case, there are N/2 odd integers in the set of positive integers not greater than N.

Now, let's consider the case where N is even. In this case, there are (N/2) odd integers in the set of positive integers not greater than N.

So, the probability that Takahashi chooses an odd integer is:

P = (N/2) / N

This is because the probability of choosing an odd integer is equal to the number of odd integers in the set of positive integers not greater than N divided by the total number of integers in the set.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is:

P = (N/2) / N

This is the probability that Takahashi chooses an odd integer when choosing an integer from the positive integers not greater than N with equal

This problem is a classic example of a graph coloring problem. We can represent the people as nodes in a graph, and the testimonies as edges between the nodes. The goal is to color the nodes (i.e., assign a color to each person) such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by coloring the first person (Person 1) with color 1. Then, for each subsequent person, we check if it is consistent with the testimonies given by the previous people. If the person is consistent with the testimonies, we can color it with the same color as the previous person. If the person is not consistent with the testimonies, we need to find a new color that is not used by any of the previous people.

We can use a hash table to keep track of the colors used by the previous people. We initialize the hash table with an empty set of colors. For each person, we check if the color we want to assign to that person is already used by any of the previous people. If it is, we need to find a new color that is not used by any of the previous people

apple ends with e, so its plural form is apples.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to write a program that takes a single word in Taknese as input and outputs its plural form. The plural form of a Taknese word is formed by adding "s" to the end of the singular form if the singular form does not end with "s", and adding "es" to the end of the singular form if the singular form ends with "s".

To solve this problem, you can use a simple if-else statement to check if the singular form ends with "s" or not. If it ends with "s", you can add "es" to the end of the singular form to get the plural form. If it does not end with "s", you can add "s" to the end of the singular form to get the plural form.

Here is an example of how you can solve this problem:
```
def plural(word):
    if word.endswith("s"):
        return word + "es"
    else:
        return word + "s"
```
This function takes a single word as input and returns its plural form. It uses the `endswith()` method to check if the singular form

N Snukes called Snuke 1, Snuke 2, ..., Snuke N live in a town.
There are K kinds of snacks sold in this town, called Snack 1, Snack 2, ..., Snack K. The following d_i Snukes have Snack i: Snuke A_{i, 1}, A_{i, 2}, \cdots, A_{i, {d_i}}.
Takahashi will walk around this town and make mischief on the Snukes who have no snacks. How many Snukes will fall victim to Takahashi's mischief?

-----Constraints-----

 - Snuke 1 has Snack 1.
 - Snuke 2 has no snacks.
 - Snuke 3 has Snack 1 and 2.
Thus, there will be one victim: Snuke 2.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the number of Snukes that will fall victim to Takahashi's mischief.

We are given N Snukes, and each Snuke has a set of Snacks that it has. There are K kinds of Snacks, and each Snuke has a set of Snacks that it has.

Takahashi will walk around the town and make mischief on the Snukes who have no snacks. We need to find the number of Snukes that will fall victim to Takahashi's mischief.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of Snukes that have no snacks. We can do this by finding the number of Snukes that have no Snack 1, the number of Snukes that have no Snack 2, and so on.

We can do this by using a loop to iterate through each Snuke and check if it has any Snack. If a Snuke has no Snack, we can add it to a list of Snukes that have no snacks.

There are N slimes lining up from left to right. The colors of these slimes will be given as a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters. The i-th slime from the left has the color that corresponds to the i-th character of S.
Adjacent slimes with the same color will fuse into one larger slime without changing the color. If there were a slime adjacent to this group of slimes before fusion, that slime is now adjacent to the new larger slime.
Ultimately, how many slimes will be there?

-----Sample Output-----

Ultimately, these slimes will fuse into abaca.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the number of slimes after all the adjacent slimes with the same color have fused together.

We can solve this problem by keeping track of the number of slimes and the colors of the slimes. We can use a hash table to keep track of the colors of the slimes and their corresponding number.

We start by initializing the hash table with the colors of the first slime. We then iterate through the rest of the slimes, and for each slime, we check if the color of the current slime is already in the hash table. If it is, we increase the number of slimes with that color by 1. If it's not, we add the color of the current slime to the hash table with a count of 1.

After we've processed all the slimes, we can print the number of slimes by summing up the counts of all the colors in the hash table.

Here's an example of how this would work:

As AtCoder Beginner Contest 100 is taking place, the office of AtCoder, Inc. is decorated with a sequence of length N, a = {a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_N}.

Snuke, an employee, would like to play with this sequence.
Specifically, he would like to repeat the following operation as many times as possible:
For every i satisfying 1 \leq i \leq N, perform one of the following: "divide a_i by 2" and "multiply a_i by 3".  
Here, choosing "multiply a_i by 3" for every i is not allowed, and the value of a_i after the operation must be an integer.

At most how many operations can be performed?

-----Constraints-----
 - N is an integer between 1 and 10 \ 000 (inclusive).
 - a_i is an integer between 1 and 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000 (inclusive).

-----Input-----

a_1 a_2 a_3 ... a_N

-----Output-----
Print the maximum number of operations that Snuke can perform.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----

The sequence is initially {5, 2, 4}. Three operations can be performed as follows:
 - First, multiply a_1 by 3, multiply a_2 by 3 and divide a_3 by 2. The sequence is now {15, 6, 2}.
 - Next, multiply a_1 by 3, divide a_2 by 2 and multiply a_3 by 3. The sequence is now {45, 3, 6}.
 - Finally, multiply a_1 by 3, multiply a_2 by 3 and divide a_3 by 2. The sequence is now {135, 9, 3}.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the maximum number of operations that Snuke can perform on the sequence {a_1, a_2, a_3,..., a_N} such that the following conditions are met:

1. For every i satisfying 1 ≤ i ≤ N, perform one of the following: "divide a_i by 2" and "multiply a_i by 3".
2. Choosing "multiply a_i by 3" for every i is not allowed.
3. The value of a_i after the operation must be an integer.

The solution is to perform the following operations:

1. Divide a_1 by 2 and multiply a_1 by 3.
2. Divide a_2 by 2 and multiply a_2 by 3.
3. Divide a_3 by 2 and multiply a_3 by 3.

This will result in the sequence {3, 2, 2}.

The maximum number of operations that Snuke can perform is 3.

The statement "there are 3 animals in total in the garden, and they have 8 legs in total" is correct if there are two cranes and one turtle. Thus, there is a combination of numbers of cranes and turtles in which the statement is correct.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking whether there is a combination of numbers of cranes and turtles in which the statement "there are X animals in total in the garden, and they have Y legs in total" is correct, where X and Y are given as input.

To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of numbers of cranes and turtles that satisfies the given statement.

Let's consider the statement "there are X animals in total in the garden, and they have Y legs in total".

If X = 2 and Y = 8, then there are two cranes and one turtle in the garden, and they have 8 legs in total. This satisfies the statement.

If X = 3 and Y = 8, then there are three cranes and one turtle in the garden, and they have 8 legs in total. This also satisfies the statement.

If X = 4 and Y = 8, then there are four cranes and one turtle in the garden, and they have 8 legs in total. This does not satisfy the statement, because there are only three cranes and one turtle

You are given an undirected unweighted graph with N vertices and M edges that contains neither self-loops nor double edges.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of different paths that start from vertex 1 and visit all the vertices exactly once in an undirected unweighted graph with N vertices and M edges that contains neither self-loops nor double edges.

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. Let's define a function `countPaths(u)` that returns the number of different paths that start from vertex `u` and visit all the vertices exactly once. The base case is when `u` is the last vertex in the graph, in which case there is only one path that starts from `u` and visits all the vertices exactly once.

The recursive case is when `u` is not the last vertex in the graph. In this case, we need to find the number of different paths that start from `u` and visit all the vertices exactly once. We can do this by finding the number of different paths that start from each of the vertices that are connected to `u` and visit all the vertices exactly once.

We can use a DFS (Depth-First Search) algorithm to find the number of different paths that start from each of the vertices that are connected to `u`. We can

You have N apples, called Apple 1, Apple 2, Apple 3, ..., Apple N. The flavor of Apple i is L+i-1, which can be negative.
You can make an apple pie using one or more of the apples. The flavor of the apple pie will be the sum of the flavors of the apples used.
You planned to make an apple pie using all of the apples, but being hungry tempts you to eat one of them, which can no longer be used to make the apple pie.
You want to make an apple pie that is as similar as possible to the one that you planned to make. Thus, you will choose the apple to eat so that the flavor of the apple pie made of the remaining N-1 apples will have the smallest possible absolute difference from the flavor of the apple pie made of all the N apples.
Find the flavor of the apple pie made of the remaining N-1 apples when you choose the apple to eat as above.
We can prove that this value is uniquely determined.

The flavors of Apple 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively. The optimal choice is to eat Apple 1, so the answer is 3+4+5+6=18.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the flavor of the apple pie made of the remaining N-1 apples when you optimally choose the apple to eat. The flavor of the apple pie made of all the N apples is the sum of the flavors of the apples used. The flavor of the apple pie made of the remaining N-1 apples is the sum of the flavors of the apples used, minus the flavor of the apple that you eat.

To find the optimal choice, you want to minimize the absolute difference between the flavor of the apple pie made of all the N apples and the flavor of the apple pie made of the remaining N-1 apples. This means that you want to choose the apple to eat so that the flavor of the apple pie made of the remaining N-1 apples has the smallest possible absolute difference from the flavor of the apple pie made of all the N apples.

We can prove that this value is uniquely determined. Let's call the flavor of the apple pie made of all the N apples "f". Let's call the flavor of the apple pie made of the remaining N-1 apples "g".

The problem is to find the nearest integer to X in the set of integers not contained in the sequence p_1,..., p_N.

To solve this problem, we can first find the set of integers not contained in the sequence p_1,..., p_N. This set can be obtained by taking the set of all integers between 1 and 100 and removing the elements in the sequence p_1,..., p_N.

Once we have the set of integers not contained in the sequence, we can find the nearest integer to X by finding the integer in the set that has the smallest absolute difference with X.

For example, if X = 6 and the sequence is 4, 7, 10, 6, 5, then the set of integers not contained in the sequence is {1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12,..., 99, 100}. The nearest integer to 6 in this set is 8.

You are given a sequence of integers of length $n$ and integer number $k$. You should print any integer number $x$ in the range of $[1; 10^9]$ (i.e. $1 \le x \le 10^9$) such that exactly $k$ elements of given sequence are less than or equal to $x$.

Note that the sequence can contain equal elements.

If there is no such $x$, print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integer numbers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le k \le n$). The second line of the input contains $n$ integer numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the sequence itself.


-----Output-----

Print any integer number $x$ from range $[1; 10^9]$ such that exactly $k$ elements of given sequence is less or equal to $x$.

If there is no such $x$, print "-1" (without quotes).

-----Note-----

In the first example $5$ is also a valid answer because the elements with indices $[1, 3, 4, 6]$ is less than or equal to $5$ and obviously less than or equal to $6$.

In the second example you cannot choose any number that only $2$ elements of the given sequence will be less than or equal to this number because $3$ elements of the given sequence will be also less than or equal to this number.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the smallest integer $x$ such that exactly $k$ elements of the given sequence are less than or equal to $x$. If such an integer does not exist, print "-1".

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can iterate through the sequence and keep track of the number of elements that are less than or equal to $x$. If the number of elements is equal to $k$, we have found the smallest integer $x$ such that exactly $k$ elements of the given sequence are less than or equal to $x$. If the number of elements is less than $k$, we can increment $x$ and repeat the process.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Initialize $x$ to 1 and $count$ to 0.
2. Iterate through the sequence and for each element $a_i$, check if $a_i \leq x$. If it is, increment $count$.
3. If $count = k$, print $x$ and stop.
4. If $count < k$, increment $x$ and repeat steps 2 and 3.

A star is a figure of the following type: an asterisk character '*' in the center of the figure and four rays (to the left, right, top, bottom) of the same positive length. The size of a star is the length of its rays. The size of a star must be a positive number (i.e. rays of length $0$ are not allowed).

Let's consider empty cells are denoted by '.', then the following figures are stars:

 [Image] The leftmost figure is a star of size $1$, the middle figure is a star of size $2$ and the rightmost figure is a star of size $3$. 

You are given a rectangular grid of size $n \times m$ consisting only of asterisks '*' and periods (dots) '.'. Rows are numbered from $1$ to $n$, columns are numbered from $1$ to $m$. Your task is to draw this grid using any number of stars or find out that it is impossible. Stars can intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. The number of stars in the output can't exceed $n \cdot m$. Each star should be completely inside the grid. You can use stars of same and arbitrary sizes.

In this problem, you do not need to minimize the number of stars. Just find any way to draw the given grid with at most $n \cdot m$ stars.

Otherwise in the first line print one integer $k$ ($0 \le k \le n \cdot m$) — the number of stars needed to draw the given grid. The next $k$ lines should contain three integers each — $x_j$, $y_j$ and $s_j$, where $x_j$ is the row index of the central star character, $y_j$ is the column index of the central star character and $s_j$ is the size of the star. Each star should be completely inside the grid.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to draw a rectangular grid of size $n \times m$ consisting only of asterisks '*' and periods (dots) '.'. The grid can be drawn using stars of different sizes. The size of a star is the length of its rays. The number of stars in the output can't exceed $n \cdot m$. Each star should be completely inside the grid.

To solve this problem, we need to find a way to draw the grid using stars of different sizes. We can start by drawing a star in the center of the grid, and then draw stars around it with different sizes. We can use the same size for multiple stars if they are not intersecting or overlapping.

Here's an example of how we can draw the grid using stars of different sizes:

1. Draw a star in the center of the grid with size $1$.
2. Draw a star on the left side of the grid with size $2$.
3. Draw a star on the right side of the grid with size $3$.
4. Draw a star on the top side of the grid with size $2$.

Let's call (yet again) a string good if its length is even, and every character in odd position of this string is different from the next character (the first character is different from the second, the third is different from the fourth, and so on). For example, the strings good, string and xyyx are good strings, and the strings bad, aa and aabc are not good. Note that the empty string is considered good.

You are given a string $s$, you have to delete minimum number of characters from this string so that it becomes good.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of characters in $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$, consisting of exactly $n$ lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

In the first line, print one integer $k$ ($0 \le k \le n$) — the minimum number of characters you have to delete from $s$ to make it good.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from the string so that it becomes good.

A good string is defined as a string with an even length, and every character in an odd position is different from the next character. For example, the string "good" is good because it has an even length and the characters in odd positions are different from the next character.

To check if a string is good, we can use a simple algorithm that checks if the length of the string is even, and if the characters in odd positions are different from the next character. If the string is good, we can print the string as is, and print 0 as the number of characters that need to be deleted.

If the string is not good, we need to delete some characters from the string so that it becomes good. We can do this by deleting the characters in odd positions that are the same as the next character. For example, if the string "aabc" is not good, we can delete the character "b" from the string, so that it becomes "aaac".

The minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from the string is the number of characters that

You are given a connected undirected graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. There are no self-loops or multiple edges in the given graph.

You have to direct its edges in such a way that the obtained directed graph does not contain any paths of length two or greater (where the length of path is denoted as the number of traversed edges).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integer numbers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $n - 1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of vertices and edges, respectively.

The following $m$ lines contain edges: edge $i$ is given as a pair of vertices $u_i$, $v_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $u_i \ne v_i$). There are no multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair ($u_i, v_i$) there are no other pairs ($u_i, v_i$) and ($v_i, u_i$) in the list of edges. It is also guaranteed that the given graph is connected (there is a path between any pair of vertex in the given graph).


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to direct edges of the given graph in such a way that the obtained directed graph does not contain paths of length at least two, print "NO" in the first line.

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line, and then print any suitable orientation of edges: a binary string (the string consisting only of '0' and '1') of length $m$. The $i$-th element of this string should be '0' if the $i$-th edge of the graph should be directed from $u_i$ to $v_i$, and '1' otherwise. Edges are numbered in the order they are given in the input.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find a directed graph with the same number of vertices and edges as the given undirected graph, such that no path of length two or greater exists in the directed graph.

To solve this problem, we can start by creating a directed graph with the same number of vertices and edges as the given undirected graph. We can do this by creating a directed edge between each pair of vertices in the undirected graph.

Next, we need to determine which edges should be directed from one vertex to another. We can do this by considering each edge in the undirected graph and determining whether it should be directed from one vertex to another. If the edge should be directed from one vertex to another, we can set the corresponding bit in the binary string to 0. If the edge should be directed from another vertex to the first vertex, we can set the corresponding bit in the binary string to 1.

Finally, we need to check whether the resulting directed graph contains any paths of length two or greater. If it does, we can print "NO" and stop. If it does not, we can print "YES" and the binary string representing the orientation of the edges.

You are given a set of $n$ segments on the axis $Ox$, each segment has integer endpoints between $1$ and $m$ inclusive. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. Each segment is characterized by two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le m$) — coordinates of the left and of the right endpoints. 

Consider all integer points between $1$ and $m$ inclusive. Your task is to print all such points that don't belong to any segment. The point $x$ belongs to the segment $[l; r]$ if and only if $l \le x \le r$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 100$) — the number of segments and the upper bound for coordinates.

The next $n$ lines contain two integers each $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le m$) — the endpoints of the $i$-th segment. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. Note, it is possible that $l_i=r_i$, i.e. a segment can degenerate to a point.


-----Output-----

In the first line print one integer $k$ — the number of points that don't belong to any segment.

In the second line print exactly $k$ integers in any order — the points that don't belong to any segment. All points you print should be distinct.

If there are no such points at all, print a single integer $0$ in the first line and either leave the second line empty or do not print it at all.

-----Note-----

In the first example the point $1$ belongs to the second segment, the point $2$ belongs to the first and the second segments and the point $5$ belongs to the third segment. The points $3$ and $4$ do not belong to any segment.

In the second example all the points from $1$ to $7$ belong to the first segment.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find all the points that do not belong to any segment. We can do this by first finding all the points that belong to at least one segment, and then finding the points that do not belong to any segment.

To find the points that belong to at least one segment, we can iterate through each segment and check if the point is between the left and right endpoints of the segment. If the point is between the endpoints, we can mark it as belonging to that segment.

Once we have marked all the points that belong to at least one segment, we can find the points that do not belong to any segment by iterating through all the points and checking if they have been marked as belonging to a segment. If a point has not been marked as belonging to a segment, we can print it as a point that does not belong to any segment.

The time complexity of this solution is $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of segments and $m$ is the upper bound for coordinates. The space complexity is $O(m)$, since we need to store all the points that belong to at least one segment.

The problem is to find the number of integers between A and B (inclusive) that can be evenly divided by neither C nor D.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by checking if A is evenly divisible by C or D. If it is, we can subtract 1 from A and repeat the process.

Next, we can check if B is evenly divisible by C or D. If it is, we can add 1 to B and repeat the process.

Now, we can start iterating over the numbers between A and B (inclusive). For each number, we can check if it is evenly divisible by C or D. If it is, we can skip it and move on to the next number. If it is not, we can increment a counter to keep track of the number of integers that can be evenly divided by neither C nor D.

Finally, we can print the counter as the answer.

The problem is to determine whether a given integer N is a multiple of 9. To do this, we need to check if the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of N is a multiple of 9.

To solve this problem, we can first convert the integer N to a string. We can then iterate through the characters of the string and add up the values of each character. If the sum of the digits is a multiple of 9, then N is a multiple of 9.

Here is an example of how to solve this problem:

1. Convert N to a string:

N = 123456789

 - 9 yen, 9^2(=81) yen, 9^3(=729) yen, ...
At least how many operations are required to withdraw exactly N yen in total?

By withdrawing 1 yen, 9 yen, 36(=6^2) yen and 81(=9^2) yen, we can withdraw 127 yen in four operations.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of operations required to withdraw exactly N yen in total.

We can start by noticing that the bank allows us to withdraw only one of the following amounts in one operation:

* 6 yen, 6^2(=36) yen, 6^3(=216) yen,...
* 9 yen, 9^2(=81) yen, 9^3(=729) yen,...

We can also see that the amounts are in the form of powers of 6 and 9, and the difference between each amount is 6^2 or 9^2.

To find the minimum number of operations required to withdraw exactly N yen in total, we can start by finding the minimum number of operations required to withdraw N yen in total using the amounts that are not in the form of powers of 6 and 9.

You are given string S and T consisting of lowercase English letters.

That is, determine if S equals T after the following operation is performed some number of times:
Operation: Let S = S_1 S_2 ... S_{|S|}. Change S to S_{|S|} S_1 S_2 ... S_{|S|-1}.
Here, |X| denotes the length of the string X.

 - S and T consist of lowercase English letters.

S

-----Output-----
If S equals T after rotation, print Yes; if it does not, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
kyoto
tokyo

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

 - In the first operation, kyoto becomes okyot.
 - In the second operation, okyot becomes tokyo.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to determine if two strings, S and T, are equal after a rotation operation. The rotation operation involves reversing the order of the characters in the string.

For example, if the input strings are "kyoto" and "tokyo", the rotation operation would be to reverse the order of the characters in "kyoto", so the result would be "tokyo".

To solve this problem, you can simply perform the rotation operation on both strings and then compare them to see if they are equal. If the strings are equal after the rotation operation, then they are equal after rotation.

Here's an example of how you could solve this problem:

1. Read the input strings S and T from Standard Input.
2. Perform the rotation operation on both strings by reversing the order of the characters.
3. Compare the two rotated strings to see if they are equal. If they are equal, print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".

Given are two strings S and T.
Let us change some of the characters in S so that T will be a substring of S.
At least how many characters do we need to change?
Here, a substring is a consecutive subsequence. For example, xxx is a substring of yxxxy, but not a substring of xxyxx.

-----Constraints-----
 - The lengths of S and T are each at least 1 and at most 1000.
 - The length of T is at most that of S.
 - S and T consist of lowercase English letters.

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
T

-----Output-----
Print the minimum number of characters in S that need to be changed.

-----Sample Input-----
cabacc
abc

-----Sample Output-----
1

For example, changing the fourth character a in S to c will match the second through fourth characters in S to T.
Since S itself does not have T as its substring, this number of changes - one - is the minimum needed.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of characters in string S that need to be changed so that T is a substring of S.

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We start with an empty window, and then move the window along the string S, one character at a time.

At each position, we check if the characters in the window match the characters in T. If they do, we increment a counter to keep track of the number of characters that need to be changed.

If the characters in the window do not match T, we reset the counter to 0 and move the window to the next position.

Once we have processed the entire string S, we print the minimum number of characters that need to be changed.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of S. The space complexity is O(1), since we only need to keep track of a single counter.

By exchanging his money so that he gets two 500-yen coins and four 5-yen coins, he gains 2020 happiness points, which is the maximum number of happiness points that can be earned.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of happiness points that Takahashi can earn by exchanging his money.

Next, let's consider the number of 5-yen coins that Takahashi can get. Since Takahashi has X yen, he can get 2000 5-yen coins.

Now, let's calculate the total number of happiness points that Takahashi can earn. For each 500-yen coin, he gains 1000 happiness points, and for each 5-yen coin, he gains 5 happiness points. Therefore, the total number of happiness points that Takahashi can earn is:

Assume the meeting is held at coordinate 2. In this case, the first person will spend (1 - 2)^2 points of stamina, and the second person will spend (4 - 2)^2 = 4 points of stamina, for a total of 5 points of stamina. This is the minimum total stamina that the 2 people have to spend.
Note that you can hold the meeting only at an integer coordinate.

-----Plan-----
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum total stamina that the first i people have to spend to attend a meeting at coordinate j.

We can fill in the dp array as follows:

* dp[0][j] = 0, since there are no people to attend the meeting.
* dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + (X_i - j)^2, if j is an integer.
* dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + (X_i - j)^2 + 1, if j is not an integer.

The reasoning behind this is as follows:

* If j is an integer, then the first i people can attend the meeting at coordinate j without spending any additional stamina. The total stamina spent by the first i people is dp[i-1][j-1], since the first i-1 people have already attended the meeting at coordinate j-1. The stamina spent by the i-th person is (

B = A x N

where N is the number of power strips required.

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
You will be given a string S of length 3 representing the weather forecast for three days in the past.
The i-th character (1 \leq i \leq 3) of S represents the forecast for the i-th day. S, C, and R stand for sunny, cloudy, and rainy, respectively.
You will also be given a string T of length 3 representing the actual weather on those three days.
The i-th character (1 \leq i \leq 3) of S represents the actual weather on the i-th day. S, C, and R stand for sunny, cloudy, and rainy, respectively.
Print the number of days for which the forecast was correct.

-----Constraints-----
 - S and T are strings of length 3 each.
 - S and T consist of S, C, and R.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
T

-----Output-----
Print the number of days for which the forecast was correct.

-----Sample Input-----
CSS
CSR

-----Sample Output-----

 - For the first day, it was forecast to be cloudy, and it was indeed cloudy.
 - For the second day, it was forecast to be sunny, and it was indeed sunny.
 - For the third day, it was forecast to be sunny, but it was rainy.
Thus, the forecast was correct for two days in this case.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the number of days for which the forecast was correct. The forecast is given in the string S, and the actual weather is given in the string T. The forecast and actual weather are represented by the characters S, C, and R, respectively.

To solve this problem, you need to iterate through the characters of both strings and compare them. If the character in the forecast string matches the character in the actual weather string, then the forecast was correct for that day. You can use a counter to keep track of the number of correct forecasts.

Here's an example of how you can solve this problem:

1. Initialize a counter to 0.
2. Iterate through the characters of both strings.
3. If the character in the forecast string matches the character in the actual weather string, then increment the counter by 1.
4. Print the counter as the final answer.

For example, if the forecast string is "CSS" and the actual weather string is "CSR", then the correct forecasts are "C" and "S", so the counter should be incremented by 2. The final answer should be

We have a permutation p = {p_1,\ p_2,\ ...,\ p_n} of {1,\ 2,\ ...,\ n}.

 - p_i is the second smallest number among the three numbers p_{i - 1}, p_i, and p_{i + 1}.

-----Constraints-----

 - 3 \leq n \leq 20
 - p is a permutation of {1,\ 2,\ ...,\ n}.

-----Input-----

-----Output-----
Print the number of elements p_i (1 < i < n) that satisfy the condition.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----

p_2 = 3 is the second smallest number among p_1 = 1, p_2 = 3, and p_3 = 5. Also, p_4 = 4 is the second smallest number among p_3 = 5, p_4 = 4, and p_5 = 2. These two elements satisfy the condition.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of elements in the permutation that satisfy the condition that they are the second smallest number among the three numbers on either side of them.

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We can start by iterating through the permutation from left to right, and for each element, we can check if it is the second smallest number among the three numbers on either side of it. If it is, we can increment a counter to keep track of the number of elements that satisfy the condition.

Here's an example of how this approach would work:

Let's say we have the permutation {1, 3, 5, 4, 2}. We start by iterating through the permutation from left to right, and for each element, we check if it is the second smallest number among the three numbers on either side of it.

For the first element, p_1 = 1, we check if it is the second smallest number among p_2 = 3, p_3 = 5, and p_4 = 4. Since p_2 = 3 is the second smallest number, we increment the counter by

The problem is to find the angle between the line connecting two points and the x-axis. The input consists of a set of points on a plane, and the output is the angle between the line connecting two points and the x-axis.

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Read the input: The first line of the input contains the number of points, n, and the next n lines contain the coordinates of the points.
2. Calculate the angle: For each pair of points, calculate the angle between the line connecting the two points and the x-axis. The angle can be calculated using the formula:

tan(θ) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points.
3. Output the angle: Output the angle for each pair of points. The output should be a single real number θ, which is the angle between the line connecting the two points and the x-axis.

The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraints.

Polycarp has to write a coursework. The coursework consists of $m$ pages.

Polycarp also has $n$ cups of coffee. The coffee in the $i$-th cup Polycarp has $a_i$ caffeine in it. Polycarp can drink some cups of coffee (each one no more than once). He can drink cups in any order. Polycarp drinks each cup instantly and completely (i.e. he cannot split any cup into several days).

Surely, courseworks are not being written in a single day (in a perfect world of Berland, at least).

Let's consider some day of Polycarp's work. Consider Polycarp drinks $k$ cups of coffee during this day and caffeine dosages of cups Polycarp drink during this day are $a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \dots, a_{i_k}$. Then the first cup he drinks gives him energy to write $a_{i_1}$ pages of coursework, the second cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_2} - 1)$ pages, the third cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_3} - 2)$ pages, ..., the $k$-th cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_k} - k + 1)$ pages.

If Polycarp doesn't drink coffee during some day, he cannot write coursework at all that day.

Polycarp has to finish his coursework as soon as possible (spend the minimum number of days to do it). Your task is to find out this number of days or say that it is impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \le m \le 10^9$) — the number of cups of coffee and the number of pages in the coursework.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the caffeine dosage of coffee in the $i$-th cup.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to write the coursework, print -1. Otherwise print the minimum number of days Polycarp needs to do it.

-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can drink fourth cup during first day (and write $1$ page), first and second cups during second day (and write $2 + (3 - 1) = 4$ pages), fifth cup during the third day (and write $2$ pages) and third cup during the fourth day (and write $1$ page) so the answer is $4$. It is obvious that there is no way to write the coursework in three or less days.

In the second example Polycarp can drink third, fourth and second cups during first day (and write $4 + (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 6$ pages) and sixth cup during second day (and write $4$ pages) so the answer is $2$. It is obvious that Polycarp cannot write the whole coursework in one day in this test.

In the third example Polycarp can drink all cups of coffee during first day and write $5 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 2) + (5 - 3) + (5 - 4) = 15$ pages of coursework.

In the fourth example Polycarp cannot drink all cups during first day and should drink one of them during the second day. So during first day he will write $5 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 2) + (5 - 3) = 14$ pages of coursework and during second day he will write $5$ pages of coursework. This is enough to complete it.

In the fifth example Polycarp cannot write the whole coursework at all, even if he will drink one cup of coffee during each day, so the answer is -1.

-----Plan-----
This problem is a classic problem in dynamic programming. The idea is to find the minimum number of days it takes to write the coursework by considering all possible combinations of cups of coffee that Polycarp can drink.

Let's consider the case where Polycarp drinks $k$ cups of coffee during a day. The number of pages he can write during that day is given by the formula:

$$\text{pages} = \sum_{i=1}^k \max(0, a_i - i + 1)$$

where $a_i$ is the caffeine dosage of the $i$-th cup of coffee.

Now, let's consider the case where Polycarp drinks $k$ cups of coffee during $d$ days. The number of pages he can write during those $d$ days is given by the formula:

$$\text{pages} = \sum_{i=1}^k \max(0, a_i - i + 1) \cdot d$$

Now, let's consider the case where Polycarp drinks $k$ cups of coffee during $d$ days, and

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
You are given an array $s$ consisting of $n$ integers.

You have to find any array $t$ of length $k$ such that you can cut out maximum number of copies of array $t$ from array $s$.

Cutting out the copy of $t$ means that for each element $t_i$ of array $t$ you have to find $t_i$ in $s$ and remove it from $s$. If for some $t_i$ you cannot find such element in $s$, then you cannot cut out one more copy of $t$. The both arrays can contain duplicate elements.

For example, if $s = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 1]$ and $k = 3$ then one of the possible answers is $t = [1, 2, 3]$. This array $t$ can be cut out $2$ times.   To cut out the first copy of $t$ you can use the elements $[1, \underline{\textbf{2}}, 3, 2, 4, \underline{\textbf{3}}, \underline{\textbf{1}}]$ (use the highlighted elements). After cutting out the first copy of $t$ the array $s$ can look like $[1, 3, 2, 4]$.  To cut out the second copy of $t$ you can use the elements $[\underline{\textbf{1}}, \underline{\textbf{3}}, \underline{\textbf{2}}, 4]$. After cutting out the second copy of $t$ the array $s$ will be $[4]$. 

Your task is to find such array $t$ that you can cut out the copy of $t$ from $s$ maximum number of times. If there are multiple answers, you may choose any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in $s$ and the desired number of elements in $t$, respectively.

The second line of the input contains exactly $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ ($1 \le s_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print $k$ integers — the elements of array $t$ such that you can cut out maximum possible number of copies of this array from $s$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. The required array $t$ can contain duplicate elements. All the elements of $t$ ($t_1, t_2, \dots, t_k$) should satisfy the following condition: $1 \le t_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$.

-----Note-----

The first example is described in the problem statement.

In the second example the only answer is $[7, 3, 1, 3]$ and any its permutations. It can be shown that you cannot choose any other array such that the maximum number of copies you can cut out would be equal to $2$.

In the third example the array $t$ can be cut out $5$ times.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum number of copies of an array that can be cut out from another array. The given array $s$ consists of $n$ integers, and the desired array $t$ consists of $k$ integers. The goal is to find the array $t$ such that the maximum number of copies of $t$ can be cut out from $s$.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by selecting the first element of $t$ that is present in $s$. We can then remove all the copies of this element from $s$. We can repeat this process until we have used all the elements of $t$.

For example, if $s = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 1]$ and $t = [1, 2, 3]$, we can cut out two copies of $t$ from $s$. We can remove the first copy by using the elements $[1, \underline{\textbf{2}}, 3, 2, 4, \underline{\textbf{3}}, \underline{\textbf{1}}]$ (use the highlighted elements). After cutting out the first

You are given a matrix $a$, consisting of $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each cell contains an integer in it.

You can change the order of rows arbitrarily (including leaving the initial order), but you can't change the order of cells in a row. After you pick some order of rows, you traverse the whole matrix the following way: firstly visit all cells of the first column from the top row to the bottom one, then the same for the second column and so on. During the traversal you write down the sequence of the numbers on the cells in the same order you visited them. Let that sequence be $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_{nm}$. 

The traversal is $k$-acceptable if for all $i$ ($1 \le i \le nm - 1$) $|s_i - s_{i + 1}| \ge k$.

Find the maximum integer $k$ such that there exists some order of rows of matrix $a$ that it produces a $k$-acceptable traversal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 16$, $1 \le m \le 10^4$, $2 \le nm$) — the number of rows and the number of columns, respectively.

Each of the next $n$ lines contains $m$ integers ($1 \le a_{i, j} \le 10^9$) — the description of the matrix.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer $k$ — the maximum number such that there exists some order of rows of matrix $a$ that it produces an $k$-acceptable traversal.

-----Note-----

In the first example you can rearrange rows as following to get the $5$-acceptable traversal:

5 3

4 3

9 9



Then the sequence $s$ will be $[5, 10, 4, 9, 3, 8, 3, 9]$. Each pair of neighbouring elements have at least $k = 5$ difference between them.

In the second example the maximum $k = 0$, any order is $0$-acceptable.

In the third example the given order is already $3$-acceptable, you can leave it as it is.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum value of $k$ such that there exists a row order of the matrix $a$ that produces a $k$-acceptable traversal. A traversal is $k$-acceptable if for all $i$ ($1 \le i \le nm - 1$), the absolute difference between the numbers in the $i$th and $(i+1)$th cells is greater than or equal to $k$.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of $k$ such that there exists a row order of the matrix $a$ that produces a $k$-acceptable traversal. We can do this by considering all possible row orders of the matrix $a$ and checking whether each order produces a $k$-acceptable traversal.

Let $n$ and $m$ be the number of rows and columns of the matrix $a$, respectively. We can consider all possible row orders of the matrix $a$, which can be done in $n!$ ways. For each row order, we can traverse the matrix in the following way: first, we visit all cells of the first column from the top row to the bottom one, then we visit all cells of

You can not just take the file and send it. When Polycarp trying to send a file in the social network "Codehorses", he encountered an unexpected problem. If the name of the file contains three or more "x" (lowercase Latin letters "x") in a row, the system considers that the file content does not correspond to the social network topic. In this case, the file is not sent and an error message is displayed.

Determine the minimum number of characters to remove from the file name so after that the name does not contain "xxx" as a substring. Print 0 if the file name does not initially contain a forbidden substring "xxx".

You can delete characters in arbitrary positions (not necessarily consecutive). If you delete a character, then the length of a string is reduced by $1$. For example, if you delete the character in the position $2$ from the string "exxxii", then the resulting string is "exxii".


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer $n$ $(3 \le n \le 100)$ — the length of the file name.

The second line contains a string of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters only — the file name.

-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp tried to send a file with name contains number $33$, written in Roman numerals. But he can not just send the file, because it name contains three letters "x" in a row. To send the file he needs to remove any one of this letters.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of characters to remove from the file name so that the name does not contain the substring "xxx" as a substring. The file name can be modified by deleting any number of characters in arbitrary positions. The goal is to find the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the file name valid.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a table to store the minimum number of characters to remove for each substring of the file name. We can start by initializing the table with the length of the file name. We can then iterate through the file name and for each position, we can calculate the minimum number of characters to remove for the substring starting at that position. We can use a recursive formula to calculate the minimum number of characters to remove for each substring.

The recursive formula is:

min(i, j) = min(i - 1, j) if the substring starting at position i does not contain "xxx"
min(i, j) = min(i - 1, j - 1) + 1 if the substring starting at position i contains "xxx"

To solve this problem, we need to find the area of a regular dodecagon inscribed in a circle of radius r. We know that the area of a regular dodecagon is 3a^2, where a is the radius of the circle.

We can start by assuming that the radius of the circle is a, and the area of the dodecagon is 3a^2. We can then use the formula for the area of a regular dodecagon to find the area of the dodecagon inscribed in a circle of radius r.

The formula for the area of a regular dodecagon is:

A = (3 \* (r/2))^2 \* sin(30 degrees)

We can substitute the value of r/2 for a in the formula to get:

A = (3 \* (r/2))^2 \* sin(30 degrees)
= (3 \* r/2)^2 \* sin(30 degrees)
= (3 \* r)^2 \* sin(30 degrees)

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----
unsafe

There are four sheep and five wolves. The number of wolves is not less than that of sheep, so they will attack them.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to determine whether the wolves will attack the sheep based on the number of wolves and sheep. We can solve this problem by using a simple logical statement.

If the number of wolves is greater than or equal to the number of sheep, then the wolves will attack the sheep. Therefore, we can print "unsafe" if the number of wolves is greater than or equal to the number of sheep.

On the other hand, if the number of wolves is less than the number of sheep, then the wolves will not attack the sheep. Therefore, we can print "safe" if the number of wolves is less than the number of sheep.

In summary, we can solve this problem by using the following steps:

1. Read the input from Standard Input in the format S W, where S is the number of sheep and W is the number of wolves.
2. Check if the number of wolves is greater than or equal to the number of sheep.

In this case, the base of the triangle is the length of the side opposite the 90-degree angle, which is |CA|. The height of the triangle is the length of the side adjacent to the 90-degree angle, which is |AB|.

So, we can calculate the area of the triangle as follows:

Area = (|CA| × |AB|) / 2

Since the area of the triangle is an integer, we can round the result of the calculation to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the solution to the problem is to read in the lengths of the three sides of the triangle from Standard Input, calculate the area of the triangle using the formula above, and print the rounded area to Standard Output.

Takahashi likes the sound when he buys a drink from a vending machine.
That sound can be heard by spending A yen (the currency of Japan) each time.
Takahashi has B yen. He will hear the sound as many times as he can with that money, but at most C times, as he would be satisfied at that time.
How many times will he hear the sound?

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq A, B, C \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B C

-----Output-----
Print the number of times Takahashi will hear his favorite sound.

-----Sample Input-----
2 11 4

-----Sample Output-----
4

Since he has not less than 8 yen, he will hear the sound four times and be satisfied.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the maximum number of times Takahashi can hear his favorite sound with the given amount of money.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of times Takahashi can hear the sound while still having enough money to buy the drink.

Let's break down the problem:

1. Takahashi has B yen.
2. He needs to spend A yen each time to hear the sound.
3. He wants to hear the sound at most C times.

We can start by finding the maximum number of times Takahashi can hear the sound without going over the limit. We can do this by dividing B by A:

B / A = C

This gives us the maximum number of times Takahashi can hear the sound:

C = B / A

Now, we need to find the number of times Takahashi can hear the sound while still having enough money to buy the drink. We can do this by rounding down the result of the division:

C = ⌊B / A⌋

This gives us the number of times Takahashi can hear the sound:

We have 2 \times 5 = 10.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to compute the product of two integers, A and B. The input is given in the format A B, where A and B are integers between 1 and 100, inclusive.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Read the input from Standard Input.
2. Store the values of A and B in two variables, say, a and b.
3. Compute the product of A and B using the multiplication operator, * or \*.
4. Print the result as an integer.

Here is the code in Python:
```
a, b = input().split()
result = a * b
print(result)
```
In this code, we first read the input from Standard Input using the input() function. We then split the input string into two parts using the split() function, where the delimiter is a space. We store the first part in the variable a and the second part in the variable b.

Next, we compute the product of A and B using the multiplication operator, * or \*. We store the result in the variable result.

Finally, we print the result as an integer

 - Five biscuits will be produced three seconds after activation.
 - Another five biscuits will be produced six seconds after activation.
 - Thus, a total of ten biscuits will be produced within 7.5 seconds after activation.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of biscuits produced within T + 0.5 seconds after activation.

We know that the biscuit making machine produces B biscuits at the following moments: A seconds, 2A seconds, 3A seconds and each subsequent multiple of A seconds after activation.

We can start by finding the number of biscuits produced in the first T seconds after activation. We know that the machine produces B biscuits at the following moments: A seconds, 2A seconds, 3A seconds and each subsequent multiple of A seconds after activation.

So, we can calculate the number of biscuits produced in the first T seconds as follows:

1. Biscuits produced in the first A seconds: B
2. Biscuits produced in the first 2A seconds: 2B
3. Biscuits produced in the first 3A seconds: 3B
4. Biscuits produced in each subsequent multiple of A seconds: A biscuits

We can add up the number of biscuits produced in each of these intervals to find the total number of biscuits produced in the first T seconds

Takahashi the Jumbo will practice golf.
His objective is to get a carry distance that is a multiple of K, while he can only make a carry distance of between A and B (inclusive).

-----Sample Output-----

Among the multiples of 7, for example, 567 lies between 500 and 600.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find out if there is a multiple of K between A and B, where K is the carry distance.

We can start by checking if K is a multiple of A. If it is, then we know that K is a multiple of K, and we can print OK.

If K is not a multiple of A, then we need to find the next multiple of K that is greater than or equal to A. We can do this by dividing A by K and rounding up to the nearest integer. This will give us the next multiple of K that is greater than or equal to A.

Next, we need to check if this multiple is between A and B. If it is, then we know that K is a multiple of K, and we can print OK.

If this multiple is not between A and B, then we need to check if there is a multiple of K between A and B. We can do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of A and B, and then checking if K is a multiple of the GCD. If it is, then we know that K is a multiple of K, and we can print OK.

In order to pass the entrance examination tomorrow, Taro has to study for T more hours.
Fortunately, he can leap to World B where time passes X times as fast as it does in our world (World A).

How many hours will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B?

The output will be regarded as correct when its absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-3}.

-----Sample Input-----

While Taro studies for eight hours in World B where time passes three times as fast, 2.6666... hours will pass in World A.
Note that an absolute or relative error of at most 10^{-3} is allowed.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B.

We know that in World B, time passes X times as fast as it does in our world (World A). This means that if T hours pass in World B, (X \* T) hours will pass in World A.

We are given that Taro can leap to World B where time passes X times as fast as it does in our world. This means that if he studies for T hours in World A, he will leap to World B and study for (X \* T) hours.

Therefore, we can find the number of hours that will pass in World A by dividing the number of hours that will pass in World B by X. This will give us the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B.

So, the solution to the problem is to divide the number of hours that will pass in World B by X.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum amount of water that can be transferred from Bottle 2 to Bottle 1.

Next, we need to find the maximum amount of water that can be transferred from Bottle 2 to Bottle 1, which is the smaller of the two bottles' capacities and the amount of water in Bottle 2.

Finally, we need to subtract the amount of water that was transferred from Bottle 2 to Bottle 1 from the amount of water in Bottle 2 to find the amount of water that will remain in Bottle 2.

In the example given, the minimum amount of water that can be transferred from Bottle 2 to Bottle 1 is 2 milliliters, and the maximum amount of water that can be transferred is 3 milliliters. Therefore, the amount of water that will remain in Bott

-----Notes-----

There are 6 permutations of size 3: (1,~2,~3), (1,~3,~2), (2,~1,~3), (2,~3,~1), (3,~1,~2), and (3,~2,~1). Among them, (1,~3,~2) and (3,~1,~2) come 2-nd and 5-th in lexicographical order, so the answer is |2 - 5| = 3.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the difference between the indices of two permutations in lexicographical order.

To solve this problem, we need to find the index of the permutation P in lexicographical order. We can do this by comparing the elements of P and Q.

Let's say we have two permutations P and Q, where P is the a-th lexicographically smallest permutation and Q is the b-th lexicographically smallest permutation. We can compare the elements of P and Q to find the index of P in lexicographical order.

We can do this by comparing the elements of P and Q one by one. If the elements of P and Q are equal, we move on to the next element. If the elements of P and Q are not equal, we know that P is lexicographically smaller than Q.

We can keep doing this until we reach the end of either P or Q. If we reach the end of P before Q, we know that P is lexicographically smaller than Q. If we reach the end of Q before P, we know that Q is lexicographically smaller than P.

Here, a ACGT string is a string that contains no characters other than A, C, G and T.

-----Notes-----
A substring of a string T is a string obtained by removing zero or more characters from the beginning and the end of T.
For example, the substrings of ATCODER include TCO, AT, CODER, ATCODER and  (the empty string), but not AC.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
Print the length of the longest ACGT string that is a substring of S.

-----Sample Input-----

Among the ACGT strings that are substrings of ATCODER, the longest one is ATC.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the longest ACGT string that is a substring of the given string S. We can do this by iterating through the characters of S and keeping track of the current ACGT string. If the current character is A, C, G, or T, we add it to the current ACGT string. If the current character is not A, C, G, or T, we reset the current ACGT string to an empty string. We continue this process until we reach the end of S.

Once we have found the longest ACGT string that is a substring of S, we print its length.

Here is an example of how this solution would work:

S = ATCODER

We start by iterating through the characters of S:

A - current ACGT string: A
T - current ACGT string: AT
C - current ACGT string: ATC
O - current ACGT string: A

Among the positive integers less than or equal to 11, nine integers have an odd number of digits: 1, 2, \ldots, 9.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that have an odd number of digits.

We can start by considering the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that have an even number of digits. These numbers are the multiples of 10, such as 10, 20, 30,..., 10N.

The number of positive integers less than or equal to N that have an even number of digits is equal to the number of multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to N. This is because each multiple of 10 has an even number of digits.

To find the number of multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to N, we can use the formula:

10 * k <= N, where k is an integer.

We can solve this equation to find the largest integer k that satisfies the inequality. The largest integer k that satisfies the inequality is equal to the largest integer that is less than or equal to N/10.

Therefore, the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that have an even number of digits is equal

 - The three stones painted black are placed at coordinates 6, 7, and 8.

The problem is asking us to find all the coordinates that potentially contain a black stone, given that some K consecutive stones are painted black and the stone at coordinate X is painted black.

To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the possible coordinates that could contain a black stone. We know that the black stones are placed at coordinates 5, 6, and 7, or 6, 7, and 8, or 7, 8, and 9.

We can then print all the coordinates that potentially contain a black stone, in ascending order, with spaces in between. In this case, the coordinates are 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

 - The distance between the second point and the third point is \sqrt{|5-(-2)|^2 + |5-8|^2} = \sqrt{58}, which is not an integer.
 - The distance between the third point and the first point is \sqrt{|-2-1|^2+|8-2|^2} = 3\sqrt{5}, which is not an integer.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pairs (i, j) such that the distance between the i-th point and the j-th point is an integer.

We can start by considering the distance between the i-th point and the j-th point as a vector in D-dimensional space. Let's call this vector d_ij = (X_{ij1}, X_{ij2},..., X_{ijD}).

We can then find the integer distance between the i-th point and the j-th point by rounding the length of the vector d_ij to the nearest integer. Let's call this rounded length r_ij.

The number of pairs (i, j) such that the distance between the i-th point and the j-th point is an integer is equal to the number of pairs (i, j) such that r_ij is an integer.

We can count the number of pairs (i, j) such that r_ij is an integer by considering the following cases:

1. If r_ij is an integer, then the distance between the i-th point and the j-th point is an integer.

-----Output-----
If S is hard to enter, print Bad; otherwise, print Good.

The second and third digits are the same, so 3776 is hard to enter.

To solve this problem, we need to check if the security code contains two consecutive digits that are the same. We can do this by checking if the current digit is the same as the previous digit. If it is, then we know that the code is hard to enter.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

You have a pot and N ingredients. Each ingredient has a real number parameter called value, and the value of the i-th ingredient (1 \leq i \leq N) is v_i.
When you put two ingredients in the pot, they will vanish and result in the formation of a new ingredient. The value of the new ingredient will be (x + y) / 2 where x and y are the values of the ingredients consumed, and you can put this ingredient again in the pot.
After you compose ingredients in this way N-1 times, you will end up with one ingredient. Find the maximum possible value of this ingredient.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 50
 - 1 \leq v_i \leq 1000
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
v_1 v_2 \ldots v_N

-----Output-----
Print a decimal number (or an integer) representing the maximum possible value of the last ingredient remaining.
Your output will be judged correct when its absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-5}.

-----Sample Input-----

3 4

-----Sample Output-----
3.5

If you start with two ingredients, the only choice is to put both of them in the pot. The value of the ingredient resulting from the ingredients of values 3 and 4 is (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5.
Printing 3.50001, 3.49999, and so on will also be accepted.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the maximum possible value of the last ingredient remaining after composing N-1 ingredients in the pot. The ingredients have values v_1, v_2,..., v_N, and the value of the new ingredient after composing two ingredients is (x + y) / 2.

To solve this problem, you need to find the maximum value of the last ingredient. The maximum value is achieved when all the ingredients have the same value.

Let's consider the case where N = 2. In this case, the only choice is to put both ingredients in the pot. The value of the new ingredient is (v_1 + v_2) / 2.

Now, let's consider the case where N = 3. In this case, you have three ingredients with values v_1, v_2, and v_3. You can compose the ingredients in the following ways:

Takahashi went to an all-you-can-eat buffet with N kinds of dishes and ate all of them (Dish 1, Dish 2, \ldots, Dish N) once.
The i-th dish (1 \leq i \leq N) he ate was Dish A_i.
When he eats Dish i (1 \leq i \leq N), he gains B_i satisfaction points.
Additionally, when he eats Dish i+1 just after eating Dish i (1 \leq i \leq N - 1), he gains C_i more satisfaction points.
Find the sum of the satisfaction points he gained.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 2 \leq N \leq 20
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq N
 - A_1, A_2, ..., A_N are all different.
 - 1 \leq B_i \leq 50

-----Sample Input-----

Takahashi gained 14 satisfaction points in total, as follows:
 - First, he ate Dish 3 and gained 4 satisfaction points.
 - Next, he ate Dish 1 and gained 2 satisfaction points.
 - Lastly, he ate Dish 2 and gained 5 + 3 = 8 satisfaction points.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the total number of satisfaction points that Takahashi gained after eating all the dishes at the all-you-can-eat buffet.

We are given N dishes, and for each dish, we are given the number of satisfaction points that Takahashi gains when he eats that dish. Additionally, we are given the number of satisfaction points that Takahashi gains when he eats a dish just after eating the previous dish.

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of satisfaction points that Takahashi gains for each dish, and then sum up all the satisfaction points.

Let's consider the first dish, Dish 1. When Takahashi eats Dish 1, he gains B_1 satisfaction points. Since there is no dish before Dish 1, there is no additional satisfaction point gained. Therefore, the total number of satisfaction points that Takahashi gains for Dish 1 is B_1.

We have a string S of length N consisting of uppercase English letters.
How many times does ABC occur in S as contiguous subsequences (see Sample Inputs and Outputs)?

 - S consists of uppercase English letters.

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S

-----Output-----
Print number of occurrences of ABC in S as contiguous subsequences.

-----Sample Input-----

ZABCDBABCQ

-----Sample Output-----

Two contiguous subsequences of S are equal to ABC: the 2-nd through 4-th characters, and the 7-th through 9-th characters.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of times the substring "ABC" appears in the given string "S" as contiguous subsequences.

We can do this by using a sliding window approach. We start at the beginning of the string "S" and move the window of size 3 (i.e., the substring "ABC") over the string. We check if the substring "ABC" is equal to the substring of the same size starting at the current position of the window. If it is, we increment the count of occurrences.

We continue moving the window over the string until we reach the end of the string. We then print the count of occurrences as the final answer.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Start at the beginning of the string "S" and move the window of size 3 over the string.
2. Check if the substring "ABC" starting at the current position of the window is equal to the substring "ABC". If it is, increment the count of occurrences.
3. Move the window one character to the right and repeat step 2.
4. Continue moving the window over

How many such ways are there to choose three people, disregarding order?

-----Sample Output-----

We can choose three people with the following names:
 - MASHIKE, RUMOI, HABORO
 - MASHIKE, RUMOI, HOROKANAI
Thus, we have two ways.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of ways to choose three people from a group of N people such that the names of the chosen people start with different letters.

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of two techniques:

1. Using a hash table to keep track of the letters that have already been used.
2. Using a dynamic programming approach to find the number of ways to choose three people.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize a hash table with the letters M, A, R, C, and H.
2. For each person, check if the name starts with any of the letters in the hash table. If it does, remove that letter from the hash table.
3. If the hash table is empty, then all the letters have been used, and we have a valid combination.
4. If the hash table is not empty, then we have a combination that does not meet the condition.
5. Repeat step 2 for each person.
6. The number of valid combinations is the number of times we have a valid combination.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of people

The problem has N test cases, all of which must be passed to get an AC verdict.

We are given the number of test cases N and the number of test cases passed M. We need to check if M is equal to N, which means that all test cases have been passed. If M is equal to N, then Takahashi's submission gets an AC.

So, the solution is to check if M is equal to N. If M is equal to N, then print Yes, otherwise print No.

In sippuu, the 3-rd and 4-th characters are equal, and the 5-th and 6-th characters are also equal.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to check if the 3rd and 4th characters of the string are equal and if the 5th and 6th characters are also equal. We can do this by using a for loop to iterate through the characters of the string and check if the current character is equal to the character at the index 3 or 4, and also check if the current character is equal to the character at the index 5 or 6. If both conditions are true, then the string is coffee-like.

Here is the pseudocode for the solution:

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of whether the 3rd and 4th characters are equal.
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of whether the 5th and 6th characters are equal.
3. Iterate through the characters of the string using a for loop.

 - The first route gets him home at cost 7.
 - The second route takes longer than time T = 70.
 - The third route gets him home at cost 4.
Thus, the cost 4 of the third route is the minimum.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the smallest cost of a route that takes not longer than time T. We are given N routes, each with a cost c_i and a time t_i. We need to find the smallest cost of a route that takes not longer than time T.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We can start by considering the first route. If the cost of the first route is less than or equal to T, then we can take this route. Otherwise, we need to consider the second route. If the cost of the second route is less than or equal to T, then we can take this route. Otherwise, we need to consider the third route and so on.

We can keep doing this until we have considered all the routes. If we have considered all the routes and none of them have a cost less than or equal to T, then we print TLE. Otherwise, we print the smallest cost of a route that takes not longer than time T.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of routes. The space complexity is O(1), since we only need to store the cost and time of each route.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the minimum total travel expense for a group of N people going on a trip by train or taxi. The train will cost each person A yen, and the taxi will cost a total of B yen.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum total travel expense that is possible by using the train and taxi. We can do this by finding the minimum total travel expense that is possible by using the train alone, and then adding the cost of the taxi to that total.

To find the minimum total travel expense that is possible by using the train alone, we need to find the minimum number of trips that we can take by train to cover the total cost of the trip. We can do this by dividing the total cost of the trip by the cost of one trip by train.

For example, if the total cost of the trip is 100 yen and the cost of one trip by train is 20 yen, we can take 5 trips by train to cover the total cost of the trip. The minimum total travel expense that is possible by using the train alone is 5 \* 20 =

The only difference between the easy and the hard versions is the maximum value of $k$.

You are given an infinite sequence of form "112123123412345$\dots$" which consist of blocks of all consecutive positive integers written one after another. The first block consists of all numbers from $1$ to $1$, the second one — from $1$ to $2$, the third one — from $1$ to $3$, $\dots$, the $i$-th block consists of all numbers from $1$ to $i$. 

So the first $56$ elements of the sequence are "11212312341234512345612345671234567812345678912345678910". Elements of the sequence are numbered from one. For example, the $1$-st element of the sequence is $1$, the $3$-rd element of the sequence is $2$, the $20$-th element of the sequence is $5$, the $38$-th element is $2$, the $56$-th element of the sequence is $0$.

Your task is to answer $q$ independent queries. In the $i$-th query you are given one integer $k_i$. Calculate the digit at the position $k_i$ of the sequence.

Treeland consists of $n$ cities and $n-1$ roads. Each road is bidirectional and connects two distinct cities. From any city you can get to any other city by roads. Yes, you are right — the country's topology is an undirected tree.

There are some private road companies in Treeland. The government decided to sell roads to the companies. Each road will belong to one company and a company can own multiple roads.

The government is afraid to look unfair. They think that people in a city can consider them unfair if there is one company which owns two or more roads entering the city. The government wants to make such privatization that the number of such cities doesn't exceed $k$ and the number of companies taking part in the privatization is minimal.

Choose the number of companies $r$ such that it is possible to assign each road to one company in such a way that the number of cities that have two or more roads of one company is at most $k$. In other words, if for a city all the roads belong to the different companies then the city is good. Your task is to find the minimal $r$ that there is such assignment to companies from $1$ to $r$ that the number of cities which are not good doesn't exceed $k$. [Image] The picture illustrates the first example ($n=6, k=2$). The answer contains $r=2$ companies. Numbers on the edges denote edge indices. Edge colors mean companies: red corresponds to the first company, blue corresponds to the second company. The gray vertex (number $3$) is not good. The number of such vertices (just one) doesn't exceed $k=2$. It is impossible to have at most $k=2$ not good cities in case of one company. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \le n \le 200000, 0 \le k \le n - 1$) — the number of cities and the maximal number of cities which can have two or more roads belonging to one company.

The following $n-1$ lines contain roads, one road per line. Each line contains a pair of integers $x_i$, $y_i$ ($1 \le x_i, y_i \le n$), where $x_i$, $y_i$ are cities connected with the $i$-th road.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the required $r$ ($1 \le r \le n - 1$). In the second line print $n-1$ numbers $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_{n-1}$ ($1 \le c_i \le r$), where $c_i$ is the company to own the $i$-th road. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of companies $r$ such that each road is assigned to one company, and the number of cities with two or more roads belonging to one company is at most $k$.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We can start by assigning each road to a company in a way that minimizes the number of cities with two or more roads belonging to one company. We can do this by assigning each road to the company that has the fewest number of roads already assigned.

We can keep track of the number of cities with two or more roads belonging to one company as we go along. If we assign a road to a company, we check if the city it connects has two or more roads belonging to the same company. If it does, we increase the number of cities with two or more roads belonging to one company.

We can continue this process until we have assigned all the roads. If the number of cities with two or more roads belonging to one company exceeds $k$, we can backtrack and try a different assignment.

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of cities. The space

Oh, New Year. The time to gather all your friends and reflect on the heartwarming events of the past year...

$n$ friends live in a city which can be represented as a number line. The $i$-th friend lives in a house with an integer coordinate $x_i$. The $i$-th friend can come celebrate the New Year to the house with coordinate $x_i-1$, $x_i+1$ or stay at $x_i$. Each friend is allowed to move no more than once.

For all friends $1 \le x_i \le n$ holds, however, they can come to houses with coordinates $0$ and $n+1$ (if their houses are at $1$ or $n$, respectively).

For example, let the initial positions be $x = [1, 2, 4, 4]$. The final ones then can be $[1, 3, 3, 4]$, $[0, 2, 3, 3]$, $[2, 2, 5, 5]$, $[2, 1, 3, 5]$ and so on. The number of occupied houses is the number of distinct positions among the final ones.

So all friends choose the moves they want to perform. After that the number of occupied houses is calculated. What is the minimum and the maximum number of occupied houses can there be?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of friends.

The second line contains $n$ integers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ ($1 \le x_i \le n$) — the coordinates of the houses of the friends.


-----Output-----

Print two integers — the minimum and the maximum possible number of occupied houses after all moves are performed.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
1 2 4 4

Output
2 4

Input
9
1 1 8 8 8 4 4 4 4

Output
3 8

Input
7
4 3 7 1 4 3 3

Output
3 6



-----Note-----

In the first example friends can go to $[2, 2, 3, 3]$. So friend $1$ goes to $x_1+1$, friend $2$ stays at his house $x_2$, friend $3$ goes to $x_3-1$ and friend $4$ goes to $x_4-1$. $[1, 1, 3, 3]$, $[2, 2, 3, 3]$ or $[2, 2, 4, 4]$ are also all valid options to obtain $2$ occupied houses.

For the maximum number of occupied houses friends can go to $[1, 2, 3, 4]$ or to $[0, 2, 4, 5]$, for example.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the minimum and maximum number of occupied houses that can be achieved by a group of friends celebrating the New Year. The friends can move to the left or right of their current house, but they can only move once. The problem also states that the friends can come to houses with coordinates 0 and n+1 (if their houses are at 1 or n, respectively).

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum and maximum number of occupied houses that can be achieved by the friends. We can start by considering the number of occupied houses for each possible move.

If a friend moves to the left of their current house, the number of occupied houses decreases by 1. If a friend moves to the right of their current house, the number of occupied houses increases by 1. If a friend stays at their current house, the number of occupied houses remains the same.

We can use this information to find the minimum and maximum number of occupied houses that can be achieved by the friends. The minimum number of occupied houses is achieved when all friends move to the left of their current house, resulting in a decrease of 1 in the number of occupied houses. The maximum number of occupied houses is achieved

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
There are $n$ kids, numbered from $1$ to $n$, dancing in a circle around the Christmas tree. Let's enumerate them in a clockwise direction as $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_n$ (all these numbers are from $1$ to $n$ and are distinct, so $p$ is a permutation). Let the next kid for a kid $p_i$ be kid $p_{i + 1}$ if $i < n$ and $p_1$ otherwise. After the dance, each kid remembered two kids: the next kid (let's call him $x$) and the next kid for $x$. Each kid told you which kids he/she remembered: the kid $i$ remembered kids $a_{i, 1}$ and $a_{i, 2}$. However, the order of $a_{i, 1}$ and $a_{i, 2}$ can differ from their order in the circle. [Image] Example: 5 kids in a circle, $p=[3, 2, 4, 1, 5]$ (or any cyclic shift). The information kids remembered is: $a_{1,1}=3$, $a_{1,2}=5$; $a_{2,1}=1$, $a_{2,2}=4$; $a_{3,1}=2$, $a_{3,2}=4$; $a_{4,1}=1$, $a_{4,2}=5$; $a_{5,1}=2$, $a_{5,2}=3$. 

You have to restore the order of the kids in the circle using this information. If there are several answers, you may print any. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.

If you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of the kids.

The next $n$ lines contain $2$ integers each. The $i$-th line contains two integers $a_{i, 1}$ and $a_{i, 2}$ ($1 \le a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2} \le n, a_{i, 1} \ne a_{i, 2}$) — the kids the $i$-th kid remembered, given in arbitrary order.


-----Output-----

Print $n$ integers $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_n$ — permutation of integers from $1$ to $n$, which corresponds to the order of kids in the circle. If there are several answers, you may print any (for example, it doesn't matter which kid is the first in the circle). It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.

-----Plan-----
This problem can be solved using a combination of backtracking and permutation generation. The basic idea is to generate all possible permutations of the kids and then check if each permutation satisfies the given information.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Generate all possible permutations of the kids using a backtracking algorithm.
2. For each permutation, check if the information given by the kids is consistent with the permutation.
3. If the information is consistent, return the permutation.
4. If the information is not consistent, try the next permutation.

Here's a high-level description of the backtracking algorithm:

1. Start with an empty permutation.
2. For each kid, try to find the next kid in the permutation. If the next kid is not yet known, add it to the permutation and continue with the next kid.
3. If the next kid is known, check if the information given by the kid is consistent with the permutation. If it is not consistent, backtrack and try a different permutation.
4. If the information is consistent, return the permut

You are a coach at your local university. There are $n$ students under your supervision, the programming skill of the $i$-th student is $a_i$.

You have to create a team for a new programming competition. As you know, the more students some team has the more probable its victory is! So you have to create a team with the maximum number of students. But you also know that a team should be balanced. It means that the programming skill of each pair of students in a created team should differ by no more than $5$.

Your task is to report the maximum possible number of students in a balanced team.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of students.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is a programming skill of the $i$-th student.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the maximum possible number of students in a balanced team.

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example you can create a team with skills $[12, 17, 15]$.

In the second example you can take all students in a team because their programming skills are equal.

In the third example you can create a team consisting of a single student (and you cannot create a team consisting of at least two students).

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum number of students in a balanced team, where a balanced team is defined as a team with no more than 5 difference in programming skills between any two students.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We can start by sorting the students by their programming skills in non-decreasing order. We can then take the first student and add them to the team. We can then consider the next student and compare their programming skill to the current team's average programming skill. If the difference between the two is less than or equal to 5, we can add them to the team. If the difference is greater than 5, we cannot add them to the team.

We can continue this process until we have added all $n$ students to the team. The maximum number of students in a balanced team is the number of students we have added to the team.

For example, suppose we have 6 students with programming skills [1, 10, 17, 12, 15, 2]. We can sort the students by their programming skills in non-decreasing order to get [1, 2, 1

Vova is playing a computer game. There are in total $n$ turns in the game and Vova really wants to play all of them. The initial charge of his laptop battery (i.e. the charge before the start of the game) is $k$.

During each turn Vova can choose what to do:   If the current charge of his laptop battery is strictly greater than $a$, Vova can just play, and then the charge of his laptop battery will decrease by $a$;  if the current charge of his laptop battery is strictly greater than $b$ ($b<a$), Vova can play and charge his laptop, and then the charge of his laptop battery will decrease by $b$;  if the current charge of his laptop battery is less than or equal to $a$ and $b$ at the same time then Vova cannot do anything and loses the game. 

Regardless of Vova's turns the charge of the laptop battery is always decreases.

Vova wants to complete the game (Vova can complete the game if after each of $n$ turns the charge of the laptop battery is strictly greater than $0$). Vova has to play exactly $n$ turns. Among all possible ways to complete the game, Vova wants to choose the one where the number of turns when he just plays (first type turn) is the maximum possible. It is possible that Vova cannot complete the game at all.

Your task is to find out the maximum possible number of turns Vova can just play (make the first type turn) or report that Vova cannot complete the game.

You have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 10^5$) — the number of queries. Each query is presented by a single line.

The only line of the query contains four integers $k, n, a$ and $b$ ($1 \le k, n \le 10^9, 1 \le b < a \le 10^9$) — the initial charge of Vova's laptop battery, the number of turns in the game and values $a$ and $b$, correspondingly.


-----Output-----

For each query print one integer: -1 if Vova cannot complete the game or the maximum number of turns Vova can just play (make the first type turn) otherwise.


-----Example-----
Input
6
15 5 3 2
15 5 4 3

Output

-1
5

1



-----Note-----

In the first example query Vova can just play $4$ turns and spend $12$ units of charge and then one turn play and charge and spend $2$ more units. So the remaining charge of the battery will be $1$.

In the second example query Vova cannot complete the game because even if he will play and charge the battery during each turn then the charge of the laptop battery will be $0$ after the last turn.

-----Plan-----
In this problem, we are given a laptop battery with an initial charge of $k$ units. We are also given a game with $n$ turns, and we are asked to find the maximum number of turns that Vova can play (i.e., the first type of turn) such that the charge of the laptop battery is strictly greater than $0$ after all $n$ turns.

We are also given two values $a$ and $b$ such that if the current charge of the laptop battery is strictly greater than $a$, Vova can play and the charge of the laptop battery will decrease by $a$. If the current charge of the laptop battery is strictly greater than $b$ ($b < a$), Vova can play and charge the battery, and the charge of the laptop battery will decrease by $b$. If the current charge of the laptop battery is less than or equal to $a$ and $b$ at the same time, Vova cannot do anything and loses the game.

We need to find the maximum number of turns that Vova can play such that the charge of the laptop battery is strictly greater than $0$ after all $n$ turns. We can do this by finding the maximum

You are given a string $s$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters "a", "b" and "c" and question marks "?".

Let the number of question marks in the string $s$ be $k$. Let's replace each question mark with one of the letters "a", "b" and "c". Here we can obtain all $3^{k}$ possible strings consisting only of letters "a", "b" and "c". For example, if $s = $"ac?b?c" then we can obtain the following strings: $[$"acabac", "acabbc", "acabcc", "acbbac", "acbbbc", "acbbcc", "accbac", "accbbc", "accbcc"$]$.

Your task is to count the total number of subsequences "abc" in all resulting strings. Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo $10^{9} + 7$.

A subsequence of the string $t$ is such a sequence that can be derived from the string $t$ after removing some (possibly, zero) number of letters without changing the order of remaining letters. For example, the string "baacbc" contains two subsequences "abc" — a subsequence consisting of letters at positions $(2, 5, 6)$ and a subsequence consisting of letters at positions $(3, 5, 6)$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ $(3 \le n \le 200\,000)$ — the length of $s$.

The second line of the input contains the string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters "a", "b" and "c" and question marks"?".


-----Output-----

Print the total number of subsequences "abc" in all strings you can obtain if you replace all question marks with letters "a", "b" and "c", modulo $10^{9} + 7$.


-----Examples-----
Input

7
???????

Output

Input
9
cccbbbaaa

Output

Input

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, we can obtain $9$ strings:  "acabac" — there are $2$ subsequences "abc",  "acabbc" — there are $4$ subsequences "abc",  "acabcc" — there are $4$ subsequences "abc",  "acbbac" — there are $2$ subsequences "abc",  "acbbbc" — there are $3$ subsequences "abc",  "acbbcc" — there are $4$ subsequences "abc",  "accbac" — there is $1$ subsequence "abc",  "accbbc" — there are $2$ subsequences "abc",  "accbcc" — there are $2$ subsequences "abc". 

So, there are $2 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 24$ subsequences "abc" in total.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of substrings "abc" in a given string that can be formed by replacing all question marks with letters "a", "b", and "c".

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Replace all question marks with letters "a", "b", and "c" to obtain all possible strings.
2. Count the number of substrings "abc" in each string.
3. Sum up the number of substrings "abc" in all strings.

The number of substrings "abc" in a string can be calculated using a sliding window approach. We can use a sliding window of size 3 to scan the string and count the number of substrings "abc" in each window.

Here's an example of how to implement this approach:

1. Initialize a sliding window of size 3 with the first 3 characters of the string.
2. Scan the string from the 4th character to the last character.
3. For each character in the string, check if it is "a", "b", or "c". If it is, add it to the sliding window. If it

You are given an undirected graph consisting of $n$ vertices. A number is written on each vertex; the number on vertex $i$ is $a_i$. Initially there are no edges in the graph.

You may add some edges to this graph, but you have to pay for them. The cost of adding an edge between vertices $x$ and $y$ is $a_x + a_y$ coins. There are also $m$ special offers, each of them is denoted by three numbers $x$, $y$ and $w$, and means that you can add an edge connecting vertices $x$ and $y$ and pay $w$ coins for it. You don't have to use special offers: if there is a pair of vertices $x$ and $y$ that has a special offer associated with it, you still may connect these two vertices paying $a_x + a_y$ coins for it.

What is the minimum number of coins you have to spend to make the graph connected? Recall that a graph is connected if it's possible to get from any vertex to any other vertex using only the edges belonging to this graph.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of special offers, respectively.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^{12}$) — the numbers written on the vertices.

Then $m$ lines follow, each containing three integers $x$, $y$ and $w$ ($1 \le x, y \le n$, $1 \le w \le 10^{12}$, $x \ne y$) denoting a special offer: you may add an edge connecting vertex $x$ and vertex $y$, and this edge will cost $w$ coins.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to pay to make the graph connected.

-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to connect $1$ to $2$ using special offer $2$, and then $1$ to $3$ without using any offers.

In next two examples the optimal answer may be achieved without using special offers.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of coins required to make a graph connected. The graph is given as an undirected graph with $n$ vertices, and each vertex has a number written on it, denoted by $a_i$. The cost of adding an edge between two vertices is the sum of the numbers written on them, denoted by $a_x + a_y$. There are also $m$ special offers, which can be used to add edges between vertices.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D array $dp$ of size $n \times n$, where $dp[i][j]$ represents the minimum number of coins required to make the graph connected from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$. We can initialize $dp[i][i] = 0$ for all $i$, since we don't need to pay any coins to connect a vertex to itself.

We can then fill in the rest of the array using the following recurrence relation:

$$dp[i][j] = \min\left(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][

Polycarp lives on a coordinate line at the point $x = 0$. He goes to his friend that lives at the point $x = a$. Polycarp can move only from left to right, he can pass one unit of length each second.

Now it's raining, so some segments of his way are in the rain. Formally, it's raining on $n$ non-intersecting segments, the $i$-th segment which is in the rain is represented as $[l_i, r_i]$ ($0 \le l_i < r_i \le a$).

There are $m$ umbrellas lying on the line, the $i$-th umbrella is located at point $x_i$ ($0 \le x_i \le a$) and has weight $p_i$. When Polycarp begins his journey, he doesn't have any umbrellas.

During his journey from $x = 0$ to $x = a$ Polycarp can pick up and throw away umbrellas. Polycarp picks up and throws down any umbrella instantly. He can carry any number of umbrellas at any moment of time. Because Polycarp doesn't want to get wet, he must carry at least one umbrella while he moves from $x$ to $x + 1$ if a segment $[x, x + 1]$ is in the rain (i.e. if there exists some $i$ such that $l_i \le x$ and $x + 1 \le r_i$).

The condition above is the only requirement. For example, it is possible to go without any umbrellas to a point where some rain segment starts, pick up an umbrella at this point and move along with an umbrella. Polycarp can swap umbrellas while he is in the rain.

Each unit of length passed increases Polycarp's fatigue by the sum of the weights of umbrellas he carries while moving.

Can Polycarp make his way from point $x = 0$ to point $x = a$? If yes, find the minimum total fatigue after reaching $x = a$, if Polycarp picks up and throws away umbrellas optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $a$, $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le a, m \le 2000, 1 \le n \le \lceil\frac{a}{2}\rceil$) — the point at which Polycarp's friend lives, the number of the segments in the rain and the number of umbrellas.

Each of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($0 \le l_i < r_i \le a$) — the borders of the $i$-th segment under rain. It is guaranteed that there is no pair of intersecting segments. In other words, for each pair of segments $i$ and $j$ either $r_i < l_j$ or $r_j < l_i$.

Each of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $p_i$ ($0 \le x_i \le a$, $1 \le p_i \le 10^5$) — the location and the weight of the $i$-th umbrella.


-----Output-----

Print "-1" (without quotes) if Polycarp can't make his way from point $x = 0$ to point $x = a$. Otherwise print one integer — the minimum total fatigue after reaching $x = a$, if Polycarp picks up and throws away umbrellas optimally.

-----Note-----

In the first example the only possible strategy is to take the fourth umbrella at the point $x = 1$, keep it till the point $x = 7$ (the total fatigue at $x = 7$ will be equal to $12$), throw it away, move on from $x = 7$ to $x = 8$ without an umbrella, take the third umbrella at $x = 8$ and keep it till the end (the total fatigue at $x = 10$ will be equal to $14$). 

In the second example the only possible strategy is to take the first umbrella, move with it till the point $x = 9$, throw it away and proceed without an umbrella till the end.

-----Plan-----
This problem is a classic problem in dynamic programming. The idea is to find the minimum total fatigue after reaching $x = a$ by considering all possible strategies.

Let's define a function $f(x, y)$ that represents the minimum total fatigue after reaching $x = a$ with $y$ umbrellas. The function can be defined as follows:

* If $x = a$, then $f(x, y) = 0$ (since there is no fatigue at the end).
* If $x < a$ and $y = 0$, then $f(x, y) = -1$ (since there is no umbrella to protect Polycarp from the rain).
* If $x < a$ and $y > 0$, then $f(x, y) = \min\limits_{i = 1}^m \{f(x + 1, y - 1) + p_i\}$ (since Polycarp can pick up an umbrella at $x$ and move with it till $x + 1$ without an umbrella, throw it away and move on without an umbrella till $

-----Output-----
If the given triple is poor, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

A and C are equal, but B is different from those two numbers, so this triple is poor.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to determine whether a triple of numbers is poor or not. A triple is poor if two of the numbers are equal but the other number is different from those two numbers.

To solve this problem, you need to check if the two numbers that are equal are the same, and if the third number is different from those two numbers. If the two numbers are the same and the third number is different, then the triple is poor.

Here's an example of how you can solve this problem:

1. Read the three integers A, B, and C from Standard Input.
2. Check if A and C are equal. If they are, then the triple is poor.
3. If A and C are not equal, then check if B is different from A and C. If B is different, then the triple is not poor.
4. If B is the same as A or C, then the triple is poor.

In the sample input given in the problem, the triple is poor because A and C are equal, but B is different from those two numbers. So, you would print "Yes" as the output.

 - The average temperature of Place 1 is 12-1000 \times 0.006=6 degrees Celsius.
 - The average temperature of Place 2 is 12-2000 \times 0.006=0 degrees Celsius.
Thus, the palace should be built at Place 1.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the place with the closest average temperature to the desired temperature of A degrees Celsius. We can solve this problem by finding the difference between the average temperature of each place and the desired temperature, and then finding the place with the smallest difference.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input: The first line of input contains the number of places N, the average temperature T, and the desired temperature A. The next line contains the elevation H_i of each place.
2. Calculate the average temperature of each place: For each place, calculate the average temperature by subtracting the elevation from the average temperature and multiplying by 0.006.
3. Find the difference between the average temperature and the desired temperature: For each place, calculate the difference between the average temperature and the desired temperature by subtracting the desired temperature from the average temperature.
4. Find the place with the smallest difference: Find the place with the smallest difference between the average temperature and the desired temperature. This is the place where the palace should be built.

We have N+M balls, each of which has an integer written on it.

It is known that:  
 - The numbers written on N of the balls are even.
 - The numbers written on M of the balls are odd.
Find the number of ways to choose two of the N+M balls (disregarding order) so that the sum of the numbers written on them is even.

It can be shown that this count does not depend on the actual values written on the balls.

-----Constraints-----
 - 0 \leq N,M \leq 100
 - 2 \leq N+M
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M

-----Output-----
Print the answer.

-----Sample Input-----
2 1

-----Sample Output-----
1

For example, let us assume that the numbers written on the three balls are 1,2,4.
 - If we choose the two balls with 1 and 2, the sum is odd;
 - If we choose the two balls with 1 and 4, the sum is odd;
 - If we choose the two balls with 2 and 4, the sum is even.
Thus, the answer is 1.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of ways to choose two of the N+M balls (disregarding order) so that the sum of the numbers written on them is even.

We know that the numbers written on N of the balls are even, and the numbers written on M of the balls are odd.

To find the number of ways to choose two of the N+M balls so that the sum of the numbers written on them is even, we can use the following approach:

1. Choose one of the N even numbers. There are N ways to do this.
2. Choose one of the M odd numbers. There are M ways to do this.
3. The sum of the two numbers is even, so we can choose either the even number and the odd number, or the odd number and the even number. There are 2 ways to do this.

Therefore, the number of ways to choose two of the N+M balls so that the sum of the numbers written on them is even is N \* M \* 2.

This count does not depend on the actual values written on the balls, so we can ignore the values and simply calculate the number of ways

You are given a string S of length N consisting of A, C, G and T. Answer the following Q queries:
 - Query i (1 \leq i \leq Q): You will be given integers l_i and r_i (1 \leq l_i < r_i \leq N). Consider the substring of S starting at index l_i and ending at index r_i (both inclusive). In this string, how many times does AC occurs as a substring?

-----Notes-----
A substring of a string T is a string obtained by removing zero or more characters from the beginning and the end of T.
For example, the substrings of ATCODER include TCO, AT, CODER, ATCODER and  (the empty string), but not AC.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq Q \leq 10^5
 - S is a string of length N.
 - Each character in S is A, C, G or T.
 - 1 \leq l_i < r_i \leq N

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the answer to the i-th query.

 - Query 1: the substring of S starting at index 3 and ending at index 7 is ACTAC. In this string, AC occurs twice as a substring.
 - Query 2: the substring of S starting at index 2 and ending at index 3 is CA. In this string, AC occurs zero times as a substring.
 - Query 3: the substring of S starting at index 1 and ending at index 8 is ACACTACG. In this string, AC occurs three times as a substring.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of times the substring "AC" appears in a given substring of the original string. We can do this by using a sliding window approach.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to solve this problem:

1. Read the input: The first line of input contains two integers, N and Q, which represent the length of the original string S and the number of queries, respectively. The second line contains the string S.
2. Initialize the sliding window: Set the starting index of the sliding window to 0.
3. Iterate over the queries: For each query, we need to find the number of times the substring "AC" appears in the substring of S starting at index l_i and ending at index r_i.
4. Check for the presence of "AC" in the substring: We can do this by checking if the substring "AC" appears in the substring of S starting at index l_i and ending at index r_i. If it does, we increment the count by 1.
5. Update the sliding window: After checking for the presence of "AC" in the substring,

A shop sells N kinds of fruits, Fruit 1, \ldots, N, at prices of p_1, \ldots, p_N yen per item, respectively. (Yen is the currency of Japan.)
Here, we will choose K kinds of fruits and buy one of each chosen kind. Find the minimum possible total price of those fruits.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq K \leq N \leq 1000
 - 1 \leq p_i \leq 1000
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
p_1 p_2 \ldots p_N

-----Output-----
Print an integer representing the minimum possible total price of fruits.

-----Sample Input-----
5 3
50 100 80 120 80

-----Sample Output-----

This shop sells Fruit 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for 50 yen, 100 yen, 80 yen, 120 yen, and 80 yen, respectively.
The minimum total price for three kinds of fruits is 50 + 80 + 80 = 210 yen when choosing Fruit 1, 3, and 5.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum total price of fruits when buying K kinds of fruits.

First, we need to read the input from the standard input. The input consists of two lines. The first line contains the number of kinds of fruits, N, and the number of kinds of fruits to be chosen, K. The second line contains the prices of each kind of fruit.

Next, we need to sort the prices in ascending order. This is because we want to choose the cheapest fruits first.

Then, we need to calculate the minimum total price of fruits. We can do this by iterating through the sorted prices and adding the price of each fruit to a running total. We need to stop when we have chosen K kinds of fruits or when we have reached the total price of the last fruit.

Finally, we need to print the minimum total price of fruits.

Here is the pseudocode for the solution:

1. Read the input from the standard input.
2. Sort the prices in ascending order.
3. Initialize a running total to 0.
4. Iterate through the sorted prices and add the

There are three airports A, B and C, and flights between each pair of airports in both directions.
A one-way flight between airports A and B takes P hours, a one-way flight between airports B and C takes Q hours, and a one-way flight between airports C and A takes R hours.
Consider a route where we start at one of the airports, fly to another airport and then fly to the other airport.
What is the minimum possible sum of the flight times?

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
P Q R

-----Output-----
Print the minimum possible sum of the flight times.

-----Sample Input-----

 - The sum of the flight times in the route A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C: 1 + 3 = 4 hours
 - The sum of the flight times in the route A \rightarrow C \rightarrow C: 4 + 3 = 7 hours
 - The sum of the flight times in the route B \rightarrow A \rightarrow C: 1 + 4 = 5 hours
 - The sum of the flight times in the route B \rightarrow C \rightarrow A: 3 + 4 = 7 hours
 - The sum of the flight times in the route C \rightarrow A \rightarrow B: 4 + 1 = 5 hours
 - The sum of the flight times in the route C \rightarrow B \rightarrow A: 3 + 1 = 4 hours
The minimum of these is 4 hours.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum possible sum of the flight times for a route that starts at one of the airports, flies to another airport, and then flies back to the starting airport. The route can be formed in several ways, and the minimum possible sum of the flight times is 4 hours.

Here are the possible routes and their corresponding flight times:

1. A -> B -> C: 1 hour + 3 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours
2. A -> C -> C: 4 hours + 3 hours + 4 hours = 11 hours
3. B -> A -> C: 1 hour + 4 hours + 3 hours = 8 hours
4. B -> C -> A: 3 hours + 4 hours + 1 hour = 8 hours
5. C -> A -> B: 4 hours + 1 hour + 3 hours = 8 hours
6. C -> B -> A: 3 hours + 1 hour + 4 hours = 8 hours

The minimum possible sum of the flight times is 4 hours, which is achieved by the route A -> B -> C -> A.

3 is less than 5, so we should print 0.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to compare two integers, X and A, and print 0 if X is less than A, and 10 if X is not less than A.

To solve this problem, we can use an if-else statement to check if X is less than A. If it is, we print 0. If it's not, we print 10.

Here's an example of how we can implement this:
```
X = int(input())
A = int(input())

if X < A:

else:

In this code, we first read in the values of X and A from the user using the `input()` function. We then use an if-else statement to check if X is less than A. If it is, we print 0. If it's not, we print 10.

Note that we use the `<` operator to compare the values of X and A. This operator checks if the value of X is less than the value of A. If it is, the if-else statement will execute the first block of code (printing

Given any integer x, Aoki can do the operation below.
Operation: Replace x with the absolute difference of x and K.
You are given the initial value of an integer N. Find the minimum possible value taken by N after Aoki does the operation zero or more times.

Initially, N=7.
After one operation, N becomes |7-4| = 3.
After two operations, N becomes |3-4| = 1, which is the minimum value taken by N.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the minimum value that N can take after Aoki performs the operation zero or more times. The operation is to replace N with the absolute difference of N and K.

To solve this problem, we can use a loop to iterate over the operations that Aoki can perform. We can start with N and keep applying the operation until we reach the minimum value that N can take.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Read the input values N and K from the standard input.
2. Initialize a variable min to 0, which will store the minimum value that N can take after the operation is performed.
3. Initialize a variable x to N, which will store the current value of N after each operation.
4. Loop until x becomes 0 or less.
5. Inside the loop, perform the operation by replacing x with the absolute difference of x and K.

6 is divisible by both 2 and 3.
Also, there is no positive integer less than 6 that is divisible by both 2 and 3.
Thus, the answer is 6.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 2 and N.

We can start by finding the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 2. This is 2 itself.

Next, we need to find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by N. We can do this by dividing N by 2 and checking if the result is an integer. If it is, then we have found the smallest positive integer that is divisible by N.

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 2 and N. We can do this by multiplying the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 2 (which is 2) by the smallest positive integer that is divisible by N (which we just found).

In this case, the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 2 is 2, and the smallest positive integer that is divisible by N is 3. Therefore, the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 2 and N is 6.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 6.

The objective is to deploy an inspector under each of the N apple trees, and for each inspector, we want to inspect the trees with numbers between i-D and i+D (inclusive).

To achieve this objective, we need to deploy at least D+1 inspectors. This is because we need to inspect the trees with numbers between i-D and i+D (inclusive) for each inspector.

For example, if we have 6 apple trees and we want to inspect the trees with numbers between i-2 and i+2 (inclusive) for each inspector, we need to deploy at least 3 inspectors.

When counting pencils in Japanese, the counter word "本" follows the number. The pronunciation of this word varies depending on the number. Specifically, the pronunciation of "本" in the phrase "N 本" for a positive integer N not exceeding 999 is as follows:
 - hon when the digit in the one's place of N is 2, 4, 5, 7, or 9;
 - pon when the digit in the one's place of N is 0, 1, 6 or 8;

To solve this problem, we need to determine the pronunciation of "本" in the phrase "N 本" based on the digit in the one's place of N.

We can do this by using a switch statement to check the value of the digit in the one's place of N. If the digit is 2, 4, 5, 7, or 9, we print "hon". If the digit is 0, 1, 6, or 8, we print "pon". And if the digit is 3, we print "bon".

To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the health points restored from eating two takoyaki over all possible choices of two takoyaki from the N takoyaki served.

Let's consider the first takoyaki. There are N-1 takoyaki left to choose from, and each of them has a different deliciousness value. So, the total health points restored from eating the first takoyaki is N-1 times the deliciousness value of the first takoyaki.

Now, let's consider the second takoyaki. There are N-2 takoyaki left to choose from, and each of them has a different deliciousness value. So, the total health points restored from eating the second takoyaki is N-2 times the deliciousness value of the second takoyaki.

We can continue this process for all the takoyaki, and we will get the total health points restored from eating

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value among the N-1 elements other than A_i in the sequence. We can do this by iterating through the sequence and keeping track of the maximum value we've seen so far.

-----Output-----
Print the maximum number of coins you can get.

-----Sample Input-----
5 3

-----Sample Output-----
9

You can get 5 + 4 = 9 coins by pressing the button of size 5 twice, and this is the maximum result.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the maximum number of coins you can get by pressing two buttons. The two buttons have different sizes, and when you press a button, you get the size of the button as coins. The size of the button decreases by 1 each time you press it.

The problem gives you two constraints:

* All values in input are integers.
* 3 ≤ A, B ≤ 20

The input is given in the following format:
A B

The output is the maximum number of coins you can get.

The sample input is 5 3, which means you have two buttons, one of size 5 and one of size 3. The sample output is 9, which means you can get 5 + 4 = 9 coins by pressing the button of size 5 twice.

To solve this problem, you need to find the maximum number of coins you can get by pressing the two buttons. The maximum number of coins you can get is the sum of the sizes of the two buttons. However, you can only press each button once, so you need to find the maximum number of coins you can

There are N candles placed on a number line.
The i-th candle from the left is placed on coordinate x_i.
Here, x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_N holds.
Initially, no candles are burning.
Snuke decides to light K of the N candles.
Now, he is at coordinate 0.
He can move left and right along the line with speed 1.
He can also light a candle when he is at the same position as the candle, in negligible time.
Find the minimum time required to light K candles.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - x_i is an integer.
 - |x_i| \leq 10^8
 - x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_N

-----Output-----
Print the minimum time required to light K candles.

-----Sample Input-----

He should move and light candles as follows:
 - Move from coordinate 0 to -10.
 - Light the second candle from the left.
 - Move from coordinate -10 to 10.
 - Light the third candle from the left.
 - Move from coordinate 10 to 20.
 - Light the fourth candle from the left.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum time required to light K candles. The candles are placed on a number line, and Snuke can move left and right along the line with speed 1. He can also light a candle when he is at the same position as the candle, in negligible time.

The solution is to move Snuke to the position of the K-th candle and light it. Then, move Snuke to the position of the (K-1)-th candle and light it. Continue this process until all K candles are lit.

The time required to light K candles is the sum of the distances between Snuke's current position and the position of the K-th candle, plus the time required to light the K-th candle. The distance between Snuke's current position and the position of the K-th candle is equal to the absolute value of the difference between the two positions.

Therefore, the minimum time required to light K candles is the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the positions of the K-th candle and Snuke's current position, plus the time required

In some village, there are 999 towers that are 1,(1+2),(1+2+3),...,(1+2+3+...+999) meters high from west to east, at intervals of 1 meter.
It had been snowing for a while before it finally stopped. For some two adjacent towers located 1 meter apart, we measured the lengths of the parts of those towers that are not covered with snow, and the results are a meters for the west tower, and b meters for the east tower.
Assuming that the depth of snow cover and the altitude are the same everywhere in the village, find the amount of the snow cover.
Assume also that the depth of the snow cover is always at least 1 meter.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq a < b < 499500(=1+2+3+...+999)
 - All values in input are integers.
 - There is no input that contradicts the assumption.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
a b

-----Output-----
If the depth of the snow cover is x meters, print x as an integer.

-----Sample Input-----
8 13

-----Sample Output-----
2

The heights of the two towers are 10 meters and 15 meters, respectively.
Thus, we can see that the depth of the snow cover is 2 meters.

-----Plan-----
Let's call the height of the first tower "h1" and the height of the second tower "h2".

We know that the distance between the two towers is 1 meter, so the difference in height is h2 - h1 = b - a.

We also know that the depth of the snow cover is at least 1 meter, so we can write:

h1 - a + 1 = h2 - b + 1

Subtracting h1 - h2 from both sides gives:

a - b = 1

So, the depth of the snow cover is 1 meter.

The health of the monster is H.
In one attack, Serval can decrease the monster's health by A.
There is no other way to decrease the monster's health.
Serval wins when the monster's health becomes 0 or below.
Find the number of attacks Serval needs to make before winning.

 - All values in input are integers.

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H A

-----Output-----

-----Sample Output-----

 - After one attack, the monster's health will be 6.
 - After two attacks, the monster's health will be 2.
 - After three attacks, the monster's health will be -2.
Thus, Serval needs to make three attacks to win.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of attacks Serval needs to make before the monster's health becomes 0 or below.

Let's first consider the case where the monster's health is initially greater than or equal to 0. In this case, Serval can make an attack and decrease the monster's health by A. If the monster's health is now 0 or below, Serval wins. Otherwise, the monster's health is now H - A, and we need to make another attack to decrease it further.

Now, let's consider the case where the monster's health is initially less than 0. In this case, Serval can make an attack and decrease the monster's health by A. If the monster's health is now 0 or below, Serval wins. Otherwise, the monster's health is now H - A, and we need to make another attack to decrease it further.

In either case, we need to make at least one attack to decrease the monster's health. Therefore, the number of attacks Serval needs to make before winning is at least 1.

For how many seconds both Alice and Bob were holding down their buttons?

Alice started holding down her button 0 second after the start-up of the robot, and released her button 75 second after the start-up.

Bob started holding down his button 25 second after the start-up, and released his button 100 second after the start-up.

Therefore, the time when both of them were holding down their buttons, is the 50 seconds from 25 seconds after the start-up to 75 seconds after the start-up.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the time interval during which both Alice and Bob were holding down their buttons.

We know that Alice started holding down her button 0 seconds after the start-up of the robot, and released her button 75 seconds after the start-up.

We also know that Bob started holding down his button 25 seconds after the start-up, and released his button 100 seconds after the start-up.

We can see that the time interval during which both Alice and Bob were holding down their buttons is between 25 seconds and 75 seconds.

Therefore, the answer is 50 seconds.

Among the numbers between 1 and 105, the only number that is odd and has exactly eight divisors is 105.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the number of odd numbers between 1 and N (inclusive) that have exactly eight positive divisors.

To solve this problem, we need to find all the odd numbers between 1 and N (inclusive) and then check if they have exactly eight positive divisors.

We can start by finding all the odd numbers between 1 and N (inclusive) using a simple loop. We can use the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is odd.

Next, we need to find the divisors of each odd number. We can use the division operator (/) to find the divisors. We need to check if the divisors are positive, so we can use the absolute value (abs()) function to get the absolute value of each divisor.

Finally, we need to count the number of odd numbers that have exactly eight positive divisors. We can use a counter variable to keep track of the number of odd numbers that have exactly eight positive divisors.

Here is the pseudocode for the solution:

1. Initialize a counter variable to 0.

When the users receive two, two and three crackers, respectively, the (absolute) difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user, is 1.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to distribute the N AtCoder Crackers to K users in such a way that the difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user is minimized.

One way to do this is to distribute the crackers in a way that each user receives an equal number of crackers. For example, if we have 7 crackers and 3 users, we can distribute them as follows:

User 1: 2 crackers
User 2: 2 crackers
User 3: 3 crackers

In this case, the largest number of crackers received by a user is 3, and the smallest number received by a user is 2, so the (absolute) difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user is 1.

Another way to distribute the crackers is to distribute them in a way that the difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user is minimized. For example, if we have 7 crackers and 3 users, we can distribute

To solve this problem, we need to find the earliest ABC where Kurohashi can make his debut.

Let's consider the first ABC to be held, which is ABC 100. The digits of the contest number in base ten are 1, 0, and 0. Since Kurohashi has never participated in any ABC before, he cannot make his debut in ABC 100.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum total cost required to complete three tasks. The cost of completing each task is given by the absolute difference between the cost of the previous task and the current task.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a two-dimensional array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum total cost required to complete the first i tasks, where the j-th task is the last task to be completed.

We can initialize the first row of the array with the cost of completing the first task, which is 0.

For each row, we can calculate the minimum total cost required to complete the first i tasks by considering all possible combinations of the last task to be completed. We can calculate the cost of completing the j-th task at the end of the i-th task by considering the cost of completing the previous task and the cost of completing the j-th task.

We can use the following formula to calculate the cost:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + |A_j - A_k|) for all k from 1 to i-

Here, an attack decreases the opponent's health by the value equal to the attacker's strength.

Next, Aoki's monster attacks Takahashi's monster, whose health is now 10-10=0.
Takahashi's monster is the first to have 0 or less health, so Takahashi loses.

The problem is asking us to determine whether Takahashi will win or lose in a battle between his monster and Aoki's monster. The health and strength of Takahashi's monster are A and B, respectively, and those of Aoki's monster are C and D, respectively.

The problem is to find the maximum value of X - Y, where X is the sum of the values of the gems obtained and Y is the sum of the costs paid.

The constraints are:

* N is the number of gems, which is between 1 and 20.
* Each gem has a value between 1 and 50.

There is a grid of squares with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns.
The square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left is represented as (i, j).
Each square is black or white.
The color of the square is given as an H-by-W matrix (a_{i, j}).
If a_{i, j} is ., the square (i, j) is white; if a_{i, j} is #, the square (i, j) is black.
Snuke is compressing this grid.
He will do so by repeatedly performing the following operation while there is a row or column that consists only of white squares:
 - Operation: choose any one row or column that consists only of white squares, remove it and delete the space between the rows or columns.
It can be shown that the final state of the grid is uniquely determined regardless of what row or column is chosen in each operation.

The problem is asking us to find the final state of a grid after Snuke has compressed it by removing rows and columns that consist only of white squares. The grid is represented as an H-by-W matrix, where each element is either a dot (.) or a pound sign (#).

To solve this problem, we need to follow the instructions given in the problem statement. We start by reading the input, which consists of two lines. The first line contains the number of rows (H) and columns (W) in the grid. The second line contains the elements of the grid, with each element separated by a space.

We then need to iterate through the grid and remove rows and columns that consist only of white squares. We can do this by iterating through the rows and columns, and checking if the current row or column consists only of white squares. If it does, we remove it and delete the space between the rows or columns.

After we have removed all the rows and columns that consist only of white squares, we print the final state of the grid. We do this by iterating through the remaining rows and columns, and printing each element of the grid.

You are given a 4-character string S consisting of uppercase English letters.
Determine if S consists of exactly two kinds of characters which both appear twice in S.

-----Constraints-----
 - The length of S is 4.
 - S consists of uppercase English letters.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
If S consists of exactly two kinds of characters which both appear twice in S, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
ASSA

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

S consists of A and S which both appear twice in S.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to check if the string S consists of exactly two kinds of characters, and if both of those characters appear twice in S.

We can do this by using a hash table to keep track of the number of times each character appears in S. We can iterate through the characters in S and increment the count for each character we see. If we see a character that we haven't seen before, we know that it must be one of the two characters that we're looking for. If we see a character that we've seen before, we know that it must be the other character that we're looking for.

Once we've iterated through all of the characters in S, we can check if we've found both characters and if they both appear twice. If we have, we print "Yes"; otherwise, we print "No".

Here's an example of how this solution might look in code:
```
def check_string(s):
    # Create a hash table to keep track of the number of times each character appears
    char_counts = {}

    # Iterate through the characters in S

The largest number among A + B = -10, A - B = -16, and A \times B = -39 is -10.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the largest number among the sum of two integers A and B, the difference of two integers A and B, and the product of two integers A and B.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Read the input from the standard input in the format A B.
2. Calculate the sum of A and B, the difference of A and B, and the product of A and B.
3. Find the largest of these three numbers.
4. Print the largest number.

The constraints of the problem are:

* All values in input are integers.
* -100 <= A, B <= 100

The sample input is -13 3, and the sample output is -10.

The solution to this problem is to read the input from the standard input, calculate the sum, difference, and product of the two integers, and then print the largest of these three numbers.

There are N mountains ranging from east to west, and an ocean to the west.
At the top of each mountain, there is an inn. You have decided to choose where to stay from these inns.
The height of the i-th mountain from the west is H_i.
You can certainly see the ocean from the inn at the top of the westmost mountain.
For the inn at the top of the i-th mountain from the west (i = 2, 3, ..., N), you can see the ocean if and only if H_1 \leq H_i, H_2 \leq H_i, ..., and H_{i-1} \leq H_i.
From how many of these N inns can you see the ocean?

You can see the ocean from the first, third and fourth inns from the west.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the number of inns from which you can see the ocean. The inns are arranged from west to east, and the height of each mountain from west to east is given.

The problem states that you can see the ocean from the inn at the top of the westmost mountain, and from the inn at the top of the i-th mountain from the west if and only if H_1 ≤ H_i, H_2 ≤ H_i,..., and H_{i-1} ≤ H_i.

To solve this problem, you need to find the number of inns for which the above condition is true.

Let's break down the condition:

* H_1 ≤ H_i: This means that the inn at the top of the i-th mountain from the west is located at a height that is less than or equal to the height of the westmost mountain.
* H_2 ≤ H_i: This means that the inn at the top of the i-th mountain from the west is located at a height that is less than or equal to the height of the second mountain from the west.

Little girl Tanya climbs the stairs inside a multi-storey building. Every time Tanya climbs a stairway, she starts counting steps from $1$ to the number of steps in this stairway. She speaks every number aloud. For example, if she climbs two stairways, the first of which contains $3$ steps, and the second contains $4$ steps, she will pronounce the numbers $1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4$.

You are given all the numbers pronounced by Tanya. How many stairways did she climb? Also, output the number of steps in each stairway.

The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.


-----Input-----

The first line contains $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the total number of numbers pronounced by Tanya.

The second line contains integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 1000$) — all the numbers Tanya pronounced while climbing the stairs, in order from the first to the last pronounced number. Passing a stairway with $x$ steps, she will pronounce the numbers $1, 2, \dots, x$ in that order.

The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.


-----Output-----

In the first line, output $t$ — the number of stairways that Tanya climbed. In the second line, output $t$ numbers — the number of steps in each stairway she climbed. Write the numbers in the correct order of passage of the stairways.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of stairways that Tanya climbed and the number of steps in each stairway.

First, we need to find the number of stairways that Tanya climbed. We can do this by counting the number of times the number $1$ appears in the sequence. Since $1$ appears in the sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, we can count the number of times $1$ appears in the sequence and subtract $1$ from the result. This will give us the number of stairways that Tanya climbed.

Next, we need to find the number of steps in each stairway. We can do this by counting the number of times each number appears in the sequence. For example, the number $1$ appears in the sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ $n$ times, so we can count the number of times $1$ appears in the sequence and divide the result by $n$. This will give us the number of steps in the first stairway.

We can repeat this process for each stairway to find the

Recently Vova found $n$ candy wrappers. He remembers that he bought $x$ candies during the first day, $2x$ candies during the second day, $4x$ candies during the third day, $\dots$, $2^{k-1} x$ candies during the $k$-th day. But there is an issue: Vova remembers neither $x$ nor $k$ but he is sure that $x$ and $k$ are positive integers and $k > 1$.

Vova will be satisfied if you tell him any positive integer $x$ so there is an integer $k>1$ that $x + 2x + 4x + \dots + 2^{k-1} x = n$. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists. Note that $k > 1$.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 10^9$) — the number of candy wrappers Vova found. It is guaranteed that there is some positive integer $x$ and integer $k>1$ that $x + 2x + 4x + \dots + 2^{k-1} x = n$.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — any positive integer value of $x$ so there is an integer $k>1$ that $x + 2x + 4x + \dots + 2^{k-1} x = n$.

-----Note-----

In the first test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $x=1, k=2$. Then $1 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 1$ equals $n=3$.

In the second test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $x=2, k=2$. Then $1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 2$ equals $n=6$.

In the third test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $x=1, k=3$. Then $1 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 1$ equals $n=7$.

In the fourth test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $x=7, k=2$. Then $1 \cdot 7 + 2 \cdot 7$ equals $n=21$.

In the fifth test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $x=4, k=3$. Then $1 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 4$ equals $n=28$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the values of $x$ and $k$ such that $x + 2x + 4x + \dots + 2^{k-1} x = n$.

To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of the first $k$ positive integers is equal to $k(k+1)/2$.

Let's consider the first test case of the example, where $n=3$. We need to find $x$ and $k$ such that $x + 2x + 4x + \dots + 2^{k-1} x = 3$.

We can start by noticing that $3 = 1 + 2 + 4$. Therefore, we can set $x=1$ and $k=3$. Then, we have:

$$1 + 2 + 4 = 1 + 2 + 4x + 2^{k-1} x$$

Since $k>1$, we can set $2^{k-1} x = 0$. Therefore, we have:

$$1 + 2 + 4 = 1 + 2 + 4

Little girl Tanya is learning how to decrease a number by one, but she does it wrong with a number consisting of two or more digits. Tanya subtracts one from a number by the following algorithm:  if the last digit of the number is non-zero, she decreases the number by one;  if the last digit of the number is zero, she divides the number by 10 (i.e. removes the last digit). 

You are given an integer number $n$. Tanya will subtract one from it $k$ times. Your task is to print the result after all $k$ subtractions.

It is guaranteed that the result will be positive integer number.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integer numbers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$, $1 \le k \le 50$) — the number from which Tanya will subtract and the number of subtractions correspondingly.


-----Output-----

Print one integer number — the result of the decreasing $n$ by one $k$ times.

It is guaranteed that the result will be positive integer number. 


-----Examples-----
Input
512 4

Output

Input
1000000000 9

Output
1



-----Note-----

The first example corresponds to the following sequence: $512 \rightarrow 511 \rightarrow 510 \rightarrow 51 \rightarrow 50$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to apply the algorithm that Tanya uses to decrease a number by one. The algorithm is as follows:

1. If the last digit of the number is non-zero, she decreases the number by one.
2. If the last digit of the number is zero, she divides the number by 10 (i.e. removes the last digit).

We can use this algorithm to decrease the given number $n$ by $k$ times. We can do this by repeatedly applying the algorithm until we reach the result.

Here's an example of how we can apply the algorithm to decrease the number $512$ by $4$ times:

1. $512$ is divided by 10, giving us $51$.
2. $51$ is divided by 10, giving us $5$.
3. $5$ is divided by 10, giving us $0$.
4. $0$ is divided by 10, giving us $0$.

Therefore, the result of decreasing $512$ by $4$ times is $0$.

There are $n$ people in a row. The height of the $i$-th person is $a_i$. You can choose any subset of these people and try to arrange them into a balanced circle.

A balanced circle is such an order of people that the difference between heights of any adjacent people is no more than $1$. For example, let heights of chosen people be $[a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \dots, a_{i_k}]$, where $k$ is the number of people you choose. Then the condition $|a_{i_j} - a_{i_{j + 1}}| \le 1$ should be satisfied for all $j$ from $1$ to $k-1$ and the condition $|a_{i_1} - a_{i_k}| \le 1$ should be also satisfied. $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$. It is obvious that the circle consisting of one person is balanced.

Your task is to choose the maximum number of people and construct a balanced circle consisting of all chosen people. It is obvious that the circle consisting of one person is balanced so the answer always exists.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of people.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the height of the $i$-th person.


-----Output-----

In the first line of the output print $k$ — the number of people in the maximum balanced circle.

In the second line print $k$ integers $res_1, res_2, \dots, res_k$, where $res_j$ is the height of the $j$-th person in the maximum balanced circle. The condition $|res_{j} - res_{j + 1}| \le 1$ should be satisfied for all $j$ from $1$ to $k-1$ and the condition $|res_{1} - res_{k}| \le 1$ should be also satisfied.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum number of people that can be arranged in a balanced circle, where the height difference between any two adjacent people is at most 1.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by choosing the person with the smallest height. We then choose the person with the next smallest height, but only if the height difference between the two people is at most 1. We continue this process until we have chosen all the people.

The key insight is that we can always find a balanced circle by starting with the person with the smallest height and then alternating between people with heights that are at most 1 apart. This is because if we have chosen a person with height $h_1$, then the next person we choose must have height at most $h_1 + 1$. If we have chosen a person with height $h_2$, then the next person we choose must have height at most $h_2 + 1$. And so on.

Therefore, the maximum number of people that can be arranged in a balanced circle is $n/2$, where $n$ is the total number of people. This is because we can always find

Ivan has $n$ songs on his phone. The size of the $i$-th song is $a_i$ bytes. Ivan also has a flash drive which can hold at most $m$ bytes in total. Initially, his flash drive is empty.

Ivan wants to copy all $n$ songs to the flash drive. He can compress the songs. If he compresses the $i$-th song, the size of the $i$-th song reduces from $a_i$ to $b_i$ bytes ($b_i < a_i$).

Ivan can compress any subset of the songs (possibly empty) and copy all the songs to his flash drive if the sum of their sizes is at most $m$. He can compress any subset of the songs (not necessarily contiguous).

Ivan wants to find the minimum number of songs he needs to compress in such a way that all his songs fit on the drive (i.e. the sum of their sizes is less than or equal to $m$).

If it is impossible to copy all the songs (even if Ivan compresses all the songs), print "-1". Otherwise print the minimum number of songs Ivan needs to compress.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9$) — the number of the songs on Ivan's phone and the capacity of Ivan's flash drive.

The next $n$ lines contain two integers each: the $i$-th line contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \le a_i, b_i \le 10^9$, $a_i > b_i$) — the initial size of the $i$-th song and the size of the $i$-th song after compression.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to compress a subset of the songs in such a way that all songs fit on the flash drive, print "-1". Otherwise print the minimum number of the songs to compress.

Input
4 16
10 8

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example Ivan can compress the first and the third songs so after these moves the sum of sizes will be equal to $8 + 7 + 1 + 5 = 21 \le 21$. Also Ivan can compress the first and the second songs, then the sum of sizes will be equal $8 + 4 + 3 + 5 = 20 \le 21$. Note that compressing any single song is not sufficient to copy all the songs on the flash drive (for example, after compressing the second song the sum of sizes will be equal to $10 + 4 + 3 + 5 = 22 > 21$).

In the second example even if Ivan compresses all the songs the sum of sizes will be equal $8 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 17 > 16$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of songs that Ivan needs to compress in order to fit all the songs on his flash drive.

We can start by sorting the songs by their initial size in descending order. Let's call the sorted list of songs "sorted_songs".

We can then iterate through the sorted_songs list and keep track of the sum of the sizes of the songs that we have already compressed. Let's call this sum "current_sum".

For each song in the sorted_songs list, we can check if the current sum plus the size of the current song is less than or equal to the capacity of the flash drive. If it is, we can add the current song to the list of compressed songs and update the current sum.

If the current sum plus the size of the current song is greater than the capacity of the flash drive, we can break out of the loop and print "-1" since it is not possible to compress a subset of the songs in such a way that all songs fit on the flash drive.

Once we have iterated through the entire sorted_songs list, we can print the minimum number of songs that

You are given three positive integers $n$, $a$ and $b$. You have to construct a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters such that each substring of length $a$ has exactly $b$ distinct letters. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.

Recall that the substring $s[l \dots r]$ is the string $s_l, s_{l+1}, \dots, s_{r}$ and its length is $r - l + 1$. In this problem you are only interested in substrings of length $a$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2000$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of a test case contains three space-separated integers $n$, $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a \le n \le 2000, 1 \le b \le \min(26, a)$), where $n$ is the length of the required string, $a$ is the length of a substring and $b$ is the required number of distinct letters in each substring of length $a$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2000$ ($\sum n \le 2000$).


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer — such a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters that each substring of length $a$ has exactly $b$ distinct letters. If there are multiple valid answers, print any of them. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

In the first test case of the example, consider all the substrings of length $5$:  "tleel": it contains $3$ distinct (unique) letters,  "leelt": it contains $3$ distinct (unique) letters,  "eelte": it contains $3$ distinct (unique) letters.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to construct a string of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters such that each substring of length $a$ has exactly $b$ distinct letters.

We can start by constructing a string of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. We can use the following approach:

1. Start with the first letter of the string.
2. For each subsequent letter, we can choose any letter that is not in the substring of length $a$ that ends at the current position.
3. Repeat step 2 until we have constructed the entire string.

For example, if $n = 7$ and $a = 5$, we can construct the string "tleelte" as follows:

1. Start with the first letter "t".
2. For the second letter, we can choose any letter that is not in the substring of length $a$ that ends at the current position, which is "tleel". We can choose "q".
3. For the third letter, we can choose any letter that is not in the substring of length $a$ that ends at the current position, which is "tleelq".

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

-----Output-----
Print an integer representing the minimum number of minutes needed to make N pieces of takoyaki.

-----Sample Input-----
20 12 6

-----Sample Output-----
12

He can make 12 pieces of takoyaki in the first 6 minutes and 8 more in the next 6 minutes, so he can make 20 in a total of 12 minutes.
Note that being able to make 12 in 6 minutes does not mean he can make 2 in 1 minute.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of minutes it takes to make N pieces of takoyaki.

We know that Takahashi can make at most X pieces of takoyaki at a time, and it takes T minutes regardless of the number of pieces to make.

We can start by making X pieces of takoyaki in the first T minutes.

After that, we can make X pieces of takoyaki again in the next T minutes, and so on.

We can keep doing this until we have made N pieces of takoyaki.

The total number of minutes it takes to make N pieces of takoyaki is the sum of the number of minutes it takes to make each group of X pieces of takoyaki.

We can calculate the number of minutes it takes to make each group of X pieces of takoyaki by dividing the total number of minutes by the number of groups we need to make.

For example, if we need to make 20 pieces of takoyaki and we can make at most 12 pieces of takoyaki at a time, we need to make 2 groups of 12 pieces of takoyaki.

Then, we can move on to the next student and form a group of three students.

The number of groups consisting of three or more students is the maximum number of groups we can form.

Therefore, the solution is to sort the students in non-decreasing order of their names and then divide them into groups of three or more students.

We have A apples and P pieces of apple.
We can cut an apple into three pieces of apple, and make one apple pie by simmering two pieces of apple in a pan.
Find the maximum number of apple pies we can make with what we have now.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 0 \leq A, P \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A P

-----Output-----
Print the maximum number of apple pies we can make with what we have.

-----Sample Input-----
1 3

-----Sample Output-----
3

We can first make one apple pie by simmering two of the three pieces of apple. Then, we can make two more by simmering the remaining piece and three more pieces obtained by cutting the whole apple.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of apple pies we can make with the given number of apples and pieces of apple.

We can start by simmering two pieces of apple to make one apple pie. This leaves us with A - 2 apples and P - 2 pieces of apple.

Next, we can cut the remaining A - 2 apples into three pieces of apple. This gives us P + 1 pieces of apple.

Now, we can simmer P + 1 pieces of apple to make one more apple pie. This leaves us with P - 1 pieces of apple.

We can repeat this process by cutting the remaining A - 2 apples into three pieces of apple and simmering P - 1 pieces of apple to make another apple pie.

This process can continue until we have used all the apples and pieces of apple. The maximum number of apple pies we can make is 3.

Therefore, the output is 3.

-----Output-----
If A is a divisor of B, print A + B; otherwise, print B - A.

-----Sample Input-----
4 12

-----Sample Output-----
16

As 4 is a divisor of 12, 4 + 12 = 16 should be printed.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the difference between two positive integers, A and B, where A is a divisor of B. If A is a divisor of B, then the difference is A + B. Otherwise, the difference is B - A.

To solve this problem, you need to check if A is a divisor of B. You can do this by dividing B by A and checking if the result is an integer. If it is, then A is a divisor of B.

Once you have determined whether A is a divisor of B, you can print the appropriate result. If A is a divisor of B, then print A + B. Otherwise, print B - A.

Here is an example of how you might solve this problem:

1. Read in the values of A and B from Standard Input.
2. Divide B by A and check if the result is an integer. If it is, then A is a divisor of B.
3. If A is a divisor of B, then print A + B. Otherwise, print B - A.

Takahashi wants to be a member of some web service.
He tried to register himself with the ID S, which turned out to be already used by another user.
Thus, he decides to register using a string obtained by appending one character at the end of S as his ID.
He is now trying to register with the ID T. Determine whether this string satisfies the property above.

-----Constraints-----
 - S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters.
 - 1 \leq |S| \leq 10
 - |T| = |S| + 1

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
T

-----Output-----
If T satisfies the property in Problem Statement, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
chokudai
chokudaiz

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

chokudaiz can be obtained by appending z at the end of chokudai.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to determine whether the string T can be obtained by appending one character at the end of S.

Let S be a string of length |S| = n. We want to check whether T, which is a string of length |T| = n + 1, can be obtained by appending one character at the end of S.

We can do this by checking whether the last character of S is the same as the first character of T. If they are the same, then we can append the last character of S to the end of T to get T.

For example, if S = "chokudai" and T = "chokudaiz", then we can append "z" to the end of "chokudai" to get "chokudaiz", which satisfies the property.

Therefore, if T satisfies the property, we print "Yes". Otherwise, we print "No".

We have two distinct integers A and B.
Print the integer K such that |A - K| = |B - K|.
If such an integer does not exist, print IMPOSSIBLE instead.

 - 0 \leq A,\ B \leq 10^9
 - A and B are distinct.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

-----Output-----
Print the integer K satisfying the condition.
If such an integer does not exist, print IMPOSSIBLE instead.

-----Sample Input-----
2 16

-----Sample Output-----
9

|2 - 9| = 7 and |16 - 9| = 7, so 9 satisfies the condition.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the integer K such that the absolute difference between A and K is equal to the absolute difference between B and K. If such an integer does not exist, print IMPOSSIBLE instead.

To solve this problem, we can start by considering the possible values of K. Since A and B are distinct integers between 0 and 10^9, we know that K cannot be equal to A or B. Therefore, K must be between A and B.

We can then consider the following cases:

* If A < B, then K must be greater than A and less than B. In this case, the absolute difference between A and K is equal to the absolute difference between B and K.
* If A > B, then K must be less than A and greater than B. In this case, the absolute difference between A and K is equal to the absolute difference between B and K.

Therefore, we can write a simple algorithm to solve this problem:

1. If A < B, then print K = (A + B) / 2.
2. If A > B, then print K = (A + B) / 2.

If N contains the digit 7, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----

117 contains 7 as its last digit.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to check if the given three-digit integer N contains the digit 7. We can do this by using the modulo operator (%) to check if the remainder of N divided by 10 is 7. If the remainder is 7, then N contains the digit 7.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input from Standard Input.
2. Store the input in a variable called N.
3. Check if the remainder of N divided by 10 is 7. If it is, then print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".

Here's the code:
```
# Read the input from Standard Input
N = int(input())

# Check if N contains the digit 7
if N % 10 == 7:
    print("Yes")
else:

In this input, N=12.
As S(12) = 1 + 2 = 3, S(N) divides N.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to determine if the sum of the digits in the decimal notation of N divides N.

We can start by converting N to a string and then iterating through each digit in the string. For each digit, we can add it to a running total. If the running total is equal to N, then we know that the sum of the digits in the decimal notation of N divides N.

Here's an example of how we can implement this solution in Python:

There is a square in the xy-plane. The coordinates of its four vertices are (x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),(x_3,y_3) and (x_4,y_4) in counter-clockwise order.
(Assume that the positive x-axis points right, and the positive y-axis points up.)
Takahashi remembers (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2), but he has forgot (x_3,y_3) and (x_4,y_4).
Given x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2, restore x_3,y_3,x_4,y_4. It can be shown that x_3,y_3,x_4 and y_4 uniquely exist and have integer values.

-----Constraints-----
 - |x_1|,|y_1|,|x_2|,|y_2| \leq 100
 - (x_1,y_1) ≠ (x_2,y_2)
 - All values in input are integers.

(0,0),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0) is the four vertices of a square in counter-clockwise order.
Note that (x_3,y_3)=(1,1),(x_4,y_4)=(1,0) is not accepted, as the vertices are in clockwise order.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the missing vertices of the square.

We are given the coordinates of two vertices, (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2), but we have forgotten the coordinates of the other two vertices.

We can use the fact that the square has four vertices, and that the coordinates of the vertices are given in counter-clockwise order.

We can start by drawing a line connecting the two known vertices, (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2).

We can then draw a line perpendicular to this line, passing through the midpoint of the line connecting the two known vertices.

This line will intersect the square at two points, which are the missing vertices.

We can then find the coordinates of these points by solving the system of equations:

x_3 = (x_1 + x_2) / 2
y_3 = (y_1 + y_2) / 2

x_4 = (x_1 - x_2) / 2
y_4 = (y_1 - y_2) /

Takahashi chose a ball with red written on it and threw it away.

The problem is asking us to find the number of balls with the string S and balls with the string T that we have now after Takahashi chooses one with the string U written on it and throws it away.

We know that S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and S and T are not equal. We also know that S = U or T = U.

Let's consider the case where S = U. In this case, we have one ball with the string S and B balls with the string T.

Let's consider the case where T = U. In this case, we have A balls with the string S and one ball with the string T.

So, the answer is the sum of the number of balls with the string S and the number of balls with the string T, which is A + B.

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

Let T =  abc, and S = T + T.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to determine whether a given string is a concatenation of two copies of some string. We can solve this problem by finding a string T such that S = T + T.

We can start by considering the length of the string S. Since S is a concatenation of two copies of some string, we know that the length of S is even. Therefore, we can divide the length of S by 2 to get the length of T.

Next, we can consider the characters of the string S. Since S is a concatenation of two copies of some string, we know that the characters of S are the same as the characters of T. Therefore, we can take the first half of the characters of S and the second half of the characters of S to get the string T.

For example, if S = "abcabc", we can take the first half of the characters of S, which is "abc", and the second half of the characters of S, which is "abc", to get the string T.

Therefore, we can conclude that if S is a concatenation of two copies of some string, we can find a string T such that S = T + T.

-----Sample Input-----

The line x=1 gives the optimal cut, and no other line does.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum possible area of the part of a rectangle that is not larger than the other part, given a point on the border or inside the rectangle.

To solve this problem, we can start by drawing a line through the point (x, y) that is parallel to the x-axis. This line will cut the rectangle into two parts, one on the left of the line and one on the right.

The area of the part on the left is the area of the triangle formed by the line, the x-axis, and the bottom edge of the rectangle. The area of the part on the right is the area of the triangle formed by the line, the x-axis, and the top edge of the rectangle.

The maximum possible area of the part on the left is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the triangle formed by the line, the x-axis, and the bottom edge of the rectangle. Similarly, the maximum possible area of the part on the right is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the triangle formed by the line, the x-axis, and the top edge of the rectangle.

You are policeman and you are playing a game with Slavik. The game is turn-based and each turn consists of two phases. During the first phase you make your move and during the second phase Slavik makes his move.

There are $n$ doors, the $i$-th door initially has durability equal to $a_i$.

During your move you can try to break one of the doors. If you choose door $i$ and its current durability is $b_i$ then you reduce its durability to $max(0, b_i - x)$ (the value $x$ is given).

During Slavik's move he tries to repair one of the doors. If he chooses door $i$ and its current durability is $b_i$ then he increases its durability to $b_i + y$ (the value $y$ is given). Slavik cannot repair doors with current durability equal to $0$.

The game lasts $10^{100}$ turns. If some player cannot make his move then he has to skip it.

Your goal is to maximize the number of doors with durability equal to $0$ at the end of the game. You can assume that Slavik wants to minimize the number of such doors. What is the number of such doors in the end if you both play optimally?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $1 \le x, y \le 10^5$) — the number of doors, value $x$ and value $y$, respectively.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the initial durability of the $i$-th door.

Print one integer — the number of doors with durability equal to $0$ at the end of the game, if you and Slavik both play optimally.

-----Plan-----
This is a classic game theory problem, known as the "Doors" problem. The goal is to maximize the number of doors with durability equal to $0$ at the end of the game, while Slavik tries to minimize the number of such doors.

To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal strategy for both players. The optimal strategy is the strategy that maximizes the expected value of the game, assuming both players play optimally.

Let's first consider the first phase of the game, where you make your move. The optimal strategy is to break one of the doors with the highest current durability. This is because breaking a door with high durability reduces the number of doors with durability equal to $0$, which is the variable we want to maximize.

Now, let's consider the second phase of the game, where Slavik makes his move. The optimal strategy for Slavik is to repair one of the doors with the lowest current durability. This is because repairing a door with low durability increases the number of doors with durability equal to $0$, which is the variable we want to minimize.

Now, let's consider the end

This algorithm can be represented as a sequence of steps:  Replace each occurrence of $1$ in the array $a$ with $2$;  Replace each occurrence of $2$ in the array $a$ with $1$;  Replace each occurrence of $3$ in the array $a$ with $4$;  Replace each occurrence of $4$ in the array $a$ with $3$;  Replace each occurrence of $5$ in the array $a$ with $6$;  Replace each occurrence of $6$ in the array $a$ with $5$;  $\dots$  Replace each occurrence of $10^9 - 1$ in the array $a$ with $10^9$;  Replace each occurrence of $10^9$ in the array $a$ with $10^9 - 1$. 

Note that the dots in the middle of this algorithm mean that Mishka applies these replacements for each pair of adjacent integers ($2i - 1, 2i$) for each $i \in\{1, 2, \ldots, 5 \cdot 10^8\}$ as described above.

For example, for the array $a = [1, 2, 4, 5, 10]$, the following sequence of arrays represents the algorithm: 

$[1, 2, 4, 5, 10]$ $\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $1$ with $2$) $\rightarrow$ $[2, 2, 4, 5, 10]$ $\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $2$ with $1$) $\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 4, 5, 10]$ $\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $3$ with $4$) $\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 4, 5, 10]$ $\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $4$ with $3$) $\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $5$ with $6$) $\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 6, 10]$ $\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $6$ with $5$) $\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\rightarrow$ $\dots$ $\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $10$ with $9$) $\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 9]$. The later steps of the algorithm do not change the array.

Mishka is very lazy and he doesn't want to apply these changes by himself. But he is very interested in their result. Help him find it.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer number $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of elements in Mishka's birthday present (surprisingly, an array).

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the elements of the array.


-----Output-----

Print $n$ integers — $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$, where $b_i$ is the final value of the $i$-th element of the array after applying "Mishka's Adjacent Replacements Algorithm" to the array $a$. Note that you cannot change the order of elements in the array.

Output

-----Note-----

The first example is described in the problem statement.

The problem is asking you to apply the "Mishka's Adjacent Replacements Algorithm" to the given array. The algorithm is described as follows:

You are given an undirected graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Your task is to find the number of connected components which are cycles.

Here are some definitions of graph theory.

An undirected graph consists of two sets: set of nodes (called vertices) and set of edges. Each edge connects a pair of vertices. All edges are bidirectional (i.e. if a vertex $a$ is connected with a vertex $b$, a vertex $b$ is also connected with a vertex $a$). An edge can't connect vertex with itself, there is at most one edge between a pair of vertices.

Two vertices $u$ and $v$ belong to the same connected component if and only if there is at least one path along edges connecting $u$ and $v$.

A connected component is a cycle if and only if its vertices can be reordered in such a way that:  the first vertex is connected with the second vertex by an edge,  the second vertex is connected with the third vertex by an edge,  ...  the last vertex is connected with the first vertex by an edge,  all the described edges of a cycle are distinct. 

A cycle doesn't contain any other edges except described above. By definition any cycle contains three or more vertices. [Image] There are $6$ connected components, $2$ of them are cycles: $[7, 10, 16]$ and $[5, 11, 9, 15]$. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integer numbers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — number of vertices and edges.

The following $m$ lines contains edges: edge $i$ is given as a pair of vertices $v_i$, $u_i$ ($1 \le v_i, u_i \le n$, $u_i \ne v_i$). There is no multiple edges in the given graph, i.e. for each pair ($v_i, u_i$) there no other pairs ($v_i, u_i$) and ($u_i, v_i$) in the list of edges.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of connected components which are also cycles.

-----Note-----

In the first example only component $[3, 4, 5]$ is also a cycle.

The illustration above corresponds to the second example.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of connected components that are also cycles. We can do this by performing a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph.

1. Initialize a set $S$ to be the set of all vertices in the graph.
2. While $S$ is not empty, perform a DFS on the graph starting from an arbitrary vertex $u \in S$.
3. If the DFS reaches a vertex $v$ that is not in $S$, add $v$ to $S$ and mark it as visited.
4. If the DFS reaches a vertex $v$ that is already marked as visited, then $v$ is a cycle.
5. After the DFS is complete, the number of cycles is the number of vertices in $S$.

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(m + n)$, where $m$ is the number of edges and $n$ is the number of vertices. The space complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize a set $S$ to be the set of all vertices in the graph

You are given an undirected tree of $n$ vertices. 

Some vertices are colored blue, some are colored red and some are uncolored. It is guaranteed that the tree contains at least one red vertex and at least one blue vertex.

You choose an edge and remove it from the tree. Tree falls apart into two connected components. Let's call an edge nice if neither of the resulting components contain vertices of both red and blue colors.

How many nice edges are there in the given tree?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of vertices in the tree.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 2$) — the colors of the vertices. $a_i = 1$ means that vertex $i$ is colored red, $a_i = 2$ means that vertex $i$ is colored blue and $a_i = 0$ means that vertex $i$ is uncolored.

The $i$-th of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $v_i$ and $u_i$ ($1 \le v_i, u_i \le n$, $v_i \ne u_i$) — the edges of the tree. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is guaranteed that the tree contains at least one red vertex and at least one blue vertex.

-----Note-----

Here is the tree from the first example: [Image] 

The only nice edge is edge $(2, 4)$. Removing it makes the tree fall apart into components $\{4\}$ and $\{1, 2, 3, 5\}$. The first component only includes a red vertex and the second component includes blue vertices and uncolored vertices.

Here is the tree from the second example: [Image] 

Every edge is nice in it.

Here is the tree from the third example: [Image] 

Edge $(1, 3)$ splits the into components $\{1\}$ and $\{3, 2\}$, the latter one includes both red and blue vertex, thus the edge isn't nice. Edge $(2, 3)$ splits the into components $\{1, 3\}$ and $\{2\}$, the former one includes both red and blue vertex, thus the edge also isn't nice. So the answer is 0.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of nice edges in an undirected tree with at least one red vertex and at least one blue vertex. A nice edge is an edge that doesn't split the tree into two components that both contain vertices of both red and blue colors.

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the tree and mark each edge as nice or not nice based on the colors of the vertices it connects. We can use a boolean variable to keep track of whether we have seen a red vertex or a blue vertex in the current component. If we have seen both, we can mark the edge as nice. If we have seen neither, we can mark the edge as not nice.

Here is a step-by-step description of the algorithm:

1. Initialize a boolean variable $red$ to false and a boolean variable $blue$ to false.
2. Initialize a counter $nice$ to 0.
3. For each edge $e$ in the tree:
	* If $e$ connects a red vertex, set $red$ to true.
	* If $e$ connects a blue vertex, set $blue

You are given two strings $s$ and $t$, both consisting of exactly $k$ lowercase Latin letters, $s$ is lexicographically less than $t$.

Let's consider list of all strings consisting of exactly $k$ lowercase Latin letters, lexicographically not less than $s$ and not greater than $t$ (including $s$ and $t$) in lexicographical order. For example, for $k=2$, $s=$"az" and $t=$"bf" the list will be ["az", "ba", "bb", "bc", "bd", "be", "bf"].

Your task is to print the median (the middle element) of this list. For the example above this will be "bc".

It is guaranteed that there is an odd number of strings lexicographically not less than $s$ and not greater than $t$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the median of a list of strings of length $k$ that are lexicographically not less than $s$ and not greater than $t$. The list is guaranteed to have an odd number of elements.

To solve this problem, we can first find the list of strings that are lexicographically not less than $s$ and not greater than $t$. We can do this by generating all possible strings of length $k$ using the alphabet of lowercase Latin letters. We can then filter out the strings that are not lexicographically between $s$ and $t$.

Once we have the filtered list, we can find the median by taking the middle element of the list. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the element that is closer to the middle.

For example, if $s=$"az" and $t=$"bf", the list of strings that are lexicographically not less than $s$ and not greater than $t$ is ["az", "ba", "bb", "bc", "bd", "be", "bf"]. The median

There are $n$ students in a school class, the rating of the $i$-th student on Codehorses is $a_i$. You have to form a team consisting of $k$ students ($1 \le k \le n$) such that the ratings of all team members are distinct.

If it is impossible to form a suitable team, print "NO" (without quotes). Otherwise print "YES", and then print $k$ distinct numbers which should be the indices of students in the team you form. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 100$) — the number of students and the size of the team you have to form.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$), where $a_i$ is the rating of $i$-th student.

If it is impossible to form a suitable team, print "NO" (without quotes). Otherwise print "YES", and then print $k$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ which should be the indices of students in the team you form.

This problem can be solved using a backtracking algorithm. The basic idea is to try all possible combinations of students and check if the ratings of the team are distinct. If a suitable team is found, print "YES" and the indices of the students in the team. If no suitable team is found, print "NO".

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Initialize a boolean array "used" of size n, where used[i] = false indicates that the i-th student has not been used in the team yet.
2. Initialize a variable "count" to 0, which will keep track of the number of students in the team.
3. While count < k:
	* Choose a student whose rating is not equal to the rating of any of the students in the team. If no such student is found, return "NO".
	* Add the chosen student to the team and increment count.
	* Mark the chosen student as used in the "used" array.
4. If all students have been used, return "YES" and the indices of the students in the team.

Two integer sequences existed initially, one of them was strictly increasing, and another one — strictly decreasing.

Strictly increasing sequence is a sequence of integers $[x_1 < x_2 < \dots < x_k]$. And strictly decreasing sequence is a sequence of integers $[y_1 > y_2 > \dots > y_l]$. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.

Elements of increasing sequence were inserted between elements of the decreasing one (and, possibly, before its first element and after its last element) without changing the order. For example, sequences $[1, 3, 4]$ and $[10, 4, 2]$ can produce the following resulting sequences: $[10, \textbf{1}, \textbf{3}, 4, 2, \textbf{4}]$, $[\textbf{1}, \textbf{3}, \textbf{4}, 10, 4, 2]$. The following sequence cannot be the result of these insertions: $[\textbf{1}, 10, \textbf{4}, 4, \textbf{3}, 2]$ because the order of elements in the increasing sequence was changed.

Let the obtained sequence be $a$. This sequence $a$ is given in the input. Your task is to find any two suitable initial sequences. One of them should be strictly increasing, and another one — strictly decreasing. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.

If there is a contradiction in the input and it is impossible to split the given sequence $a$ into one increasing sequence and one decreasing sequence, print "NO".


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in $a$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.


-----Output-----

If there is a contradiction in the input and it is impossible to split the given sequence $a$ into one increasing sequence and one decreasing sequence, print "NO" in the first line.

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. In the second line, print a sequence of $n$ integers $res_1, res_2, \dots, res_n$, where $res_i$ should be either $0$ or $1$ for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$. The $i$-th element of this sequence should be $0$ if the $i$-th element of $a$ belongs to the increasing sequence, and $1$ otherwise. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.


-----Examples-----
Input

Output
YES

Input

Output

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find two integer sequences, one strictly increasing and the other strictly decreasing, such that the elements of the increasing sequence are inserted between the elements of the decreasing sequence without changing the order. The input is a sequence of integers, and the output is a sequence of 0s and 1s indicating whether each element of the input sequence belongs to the increasing or decreasing sequence.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by considering the first element of the input sequence. If it is less than or equal to the last element of the input sequence, then we can insert it into the increasing sequence. Otherwise, we can insert it into the decreasing sequence.

Next, we can consider the second element of the input sequence. If it is less than or equal to the last element of the input sequence, then we can insert it into the increasing sequence. Otherwise, we can insert it into the decreasing sequence.

We can continue this process until we have considered all the elements of the input sequence. If we have inserted all the elements into the increasing sequence, then we can print "YES" and the resulting sequence. If we have inserted all the elements into the decreasing sequence,

Vova plans to go to the conference by train. Initially, the train is at the point $1$ and the destination point of the path is the point $L$. The speed of the train is $1$ length unit per minute (i.e. at the first minute the train is at the point $1$, at the second minute — at the point $2$ and so on).

There are lanterns on the path. They are placed at the points with coordinates divisible by $v$ (i.e. the first lantern is at the point $v$, the second is at the point $2v$ and so on).

There is also exactly one standing train which occupies all the points from $l$ to $r$ inclusive.

Vova can see the lantern at the point $p$ if $p$ is divisible by $v$ and there is no standing train at this position ($p \not\in [l; r]$). Thus, if the point with the lantern is one of the points covered by the standing train, Vova can't see this lantern.

Your problem is to say the number of lanterns Vova will see during the path. Vova plans to go to $t$ different conferences, so you should answer $t$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of queries.

Then $t$ lines follow. The $i$-th line contains four integers $L_i, v_i, l_i, r_i$ ($1 \le L, v \le 10^9$, $1 \le l \le r \le L$) — destination point of the $i$-th path, the period of the lantern appearance and the segment occupied by the standing train.


-----Output-----

Print $t$ lines. The $i$-th line should contain one integer — the answer for the $i$-th query.


-----Example-----
Input
4

1000000000 1 1 1000000000

Output
3
0
1134
0



-----Note-----

For the first example query, the answer is $3$. There are lanterns at positions $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$ and $10$, but Vova didn't see the lanterns at positions $4$ and $6$ because of the standing train.

For the second example query, the answer is $0$ because the only lantern is at the point $51$ and there is also a standing train at this point.

For the third example query, the answer is $1134$ because there are $1234$ lanterns, but Vova didn't see the lanterns from the position $100$ to the position $199$ inclusive.

For the fourth example query, the answer is $0$ because the standing train covers the whole path.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of lanterns that Vova will see during the path. We can do this by analyzing the path and the standing train.

First, let's consider the path. The path starts at the point $1$ and ends at the point $L$. The speed of the train is $1$ length unit per minute, so the train moves $1$ unit per minute.

Next, let's consider the lanterns. The lanterns are placed at the points with coordinates divisible by $v$, where $v$ is the period of the lantern appearance. In this case, the lanterns are placed at the points $v$, $2v$, $3v$, $4v$, and so on.

Now, let's consider the standing train. The standing train occupies all the points from $l$ to $r$ inclusive. In this case, the standing train occupies all the points from $51$ to $51$ inclusive, which means that it covers the entire path.

So, to find the number of lanterns that Vova will see during the path, we need to

One day, $n$ people ($n$ is an even number) met on a plaza and made two round dances, each round dance consists of exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ people. Your task is to find the number of ways $n$ people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ people. Each person should belong to exactly one of these two round dances.

Round dance is a dance circle consisting of $1$ or more people. Two round dances are indistinguishable (equal) if one can be transformed to another by choosing the first participant. For example, round dances $[1, 3, 4, 2]$, $[4, 2, 1, 3]$ and $[2, 1, 3, 4]$ are indistinguishable.

For example, if $n=2$ then the number of ways is $1$: one round dance consists of the first person and the second one of the second person.

For example, if $n=4$ then the number of ways is $3$. Possible options:  one round dance — $[1,2]$, another — $[3,4]$;  one round dance — $[2,4]$, another — $[3,1]$;  one round dance — $[4,1]$, another — $[3,2]$. 

Your task is to find the number of ways $n$ people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ people.

The problem is to find the number of ways to divide $n$ people into two round dances, where each round dance consists of exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ people. The round dances are indistinguishable if one can be transformed to another by choosing the first participant.

Let's consider the case where $n$ is even. We can divide the $n$ people into two round dances as follows:

1. Divide the first $\frac{n}{2}$ people into two groups of size $\frac{n}{4}$.
2. Divide the second $\frac{n}{2}$ people into two groups of size $\frac{n}{4}$.

For example, if $n=8$, we can divide the people into two round dances as follows:

Round dance 1: [1, 3, 5, 7]
Round dance 2: [2, 4, 6, 8]

These two round dances are indistinguishable, as we can transform one into the other by swapping the first and second people in each round dance.

  if there is at least one letter 'a', remove the leftmost occurrence and stop the algorithm, otherwise go to next item;  if there is at least one letter 'b', remove the leftmost occurrence and stop the algorithm, otherwise go to next item;  ...  remove the leftmost occurrence of the letter 'z' and stop the algorithm. 

This algorithm removes a single letter from the string. Polycarp performs this algorithm exactly $k$ times, thus removing exactly $k$ characters.

Help Polycarp find the resulting string.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 4 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of the string and the number of letters Polycarp will remove.

The second line contains the string $s$ consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print the string that will be obtained from $s$ after Polycarp removes exactly $k$ letters using the above algorithm $k$ times.

If the resulting string is empty, print nothing. It is allowed to print nothing or an empty line (line break).


-----Examples-----
Input
15 3
cccaabababaccbc

Output
cccbbabaccbc

Input
15 9
cccaabababaccbc

Output
cccccc

Input

u

Output

-----Plan-----
The solution to this problem is to use a stack to keep track of the letters that have been removed. The stack will contain the letters that have been removed in reverse order.

Here's how the algorithm works:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. For each letter in the input string, check if it is one of the letters that Polycarp wants to remove. If it is, push it onto the stack.
3. If the stack is not empty, pop the top letter from the stack and remove it from the input string.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty or the input string is empty.
5. If the stack is empty, print the resulting string. If the input string is empty, print nothing.

Here's an example of how this algorithm would work for the input "cccaabababaccbc" and k = 3:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. The input string is "cccaabababaccbc". The first letter is "c". Since "c" is not one of the letters that Polycarp wants to remove, push it onto the stack.
3. The stack

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

Ivan plays a computer game that contains some microtransactions to make characters look cooler. Since Ivan wants his character to be really cool, he wants to use some of these microtransactions — and he won't start playing until he gets all of them.

Each day (during the morning) Ivan earns exactly one burle.

There are $n$ types of microtransactions in the game. Each microtransaction costs $2$ burles usually and $1$ burle if it is on sale. Ivan has to order exactly $k_i$ microtransactions of the $i$-th type (he orders microtransactions during the evening).

Ivan can order any (possibly zero) number of microtransactions of any types during any day (of course, if he has enough money to do it). If the microtransaction he wants to order is on sale then he can buy it for $1$ burle and otherwise he can buy it for $2$ burles.

There are also $m$ special offers in the game shop. The $j$-th offer $(d_j, t_j)$ means that microtransactions of the $t_j$-th type are on sale during the $d_j$-th day.

Ivan wants to order all microtransactions as soon as possible. Your task is to calculate the minimum day when he can buy all microtransactions he want and actually start playing.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of types of microtransactions and the number of special offers in the game shop.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $k_1, k_2, \dots, k_n$ ($0 \le k_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $k_i$ is the number of copies of microtransaction of the $i$-th type Ivan has to order. It is guaranteed that sum of all $k_i$ is not less than $1$ and not greater than $2 \cdot 10^5$.

The next $m$ lines contain special offers. The $j$-th of these lines contains the $j$-th special offer. It is given as a pair of integers $(d_j, t_j)$ ($1 \le d_j \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le t_j \le n$) and means that microtransactions of the $t_j$-th type are on sale during the $d_j$-th day.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum day when Ivan can order all microtransactions he wants and actually start playing.

-----Plan-----
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum day when Ivan can order all microtransactions of type i and actually start playing, assuming he has already ordered j microtransactions of type i.

The base case is when j = 0, in which case Ivan can start playing immediately.

For the recursive case, we consider two possible scenarios:

1. Ivan orders a microtransaction of type i on the current day. In this case, he can start playing on the next day (day + 1).
2. Ivan does not order a microtransaction of type i on the current day. In this case, he can start playing on the same day as the minimum day when he can order all microtransactions of type i.

We can calculate the minimum day when Ivan can order all microtransactions of type i by considering both scenarios and taking the minimum of the two.

The final answer is the minimum day when Ivan can order all microtransactions he wants and actually start playing, which is the minimum of all dp[i][j] for all i and j.

A star is a figure of the following type: an asterisk character '*' in the center of the figure and four rays (to the left, right, top, bottom) of the same positive length. The size of a star is the length of its rays. The size of a star must be a positive number (i.e. rays of length $0$ are not allowed).

Let's consider empty cells are denoted by '.', then the following figures are stars:

 [Image] The leftmost figure is a star of size $1$, the middle figure is a star of size $2$ and the rightmost figure is a star of size $3$. 

You are given a rectangular grid of size $n \times m$ consisting only of asterisks '*' and periods (dots) '.'. Rows are numbered from $1$ to $n$, columns are numbered from $1$ to $m$. Your task is to draw this grid using any number of stars or find out that it is impossible. Stars can intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. The number of stars in the output can't exceed $n \cdot m$. Each star should be completely inside the grid. You can use stars of same and arbitrary sizes.

In this problem, you do not need to minimize the number of stars. Just find any way to draw the given grid with at most $n \cdot m$ stars.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($3 \le n, m \le 1000$) — the sizes of the given grid.

The next $n$ lines contains $m$ characters each, the $i$-th line describes the $i$-th row of the grid. It is guaranteed that grid consists of characters '*' and '.' only.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to draw the given grid using stars only, print "-1".

Otherwise in the first line print one integer $k$ ($0 \le k \le n \cdot m$) — the number of stars needed to draw the given grid. The next $k$ lines should contain three integers each — $x_j$, $y_j$ and $s_j$, where $x_j$ is the row index of the central star character, $y_j$ is the column index of the central star character and $s_j$ is the size of the star. Each star should be completely inside the grid.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to draw a rectangular grid of size $n \times m$ consisting only of asterisks '*' and periods (dots) '.'. The grid can be drawn using stars of different sizes. The size of a star is the length of its rays. The number of stars in the output can't exceed $n \cdot m$. Each star should be completely inside the grid.

To solve this problem, we need to find a way to draw the grid using stars of different sizes. We can start by drawing a star in the center of the grid, and then draw stars around it with different sizes. We can use the same size for multiple stars if they are not intersecting or overlapping.

Here's an example of how we can draw the grid using stars of different sizes:

1. Draw a star in the center of the grid with size $1$.
2. Draw a star on the left side of the grid with size $2$.
3. Draw a star on the right side of the grid with size $3$.
4. Draw a star on the top side of the grid with size $2$.

You are given a three-digit positive integer N.

Determine whether N is a palindromic number.

Here, a palindromic number is an integer that reads the same backward as forward in decimal notation.

-----Constraints-----
 - 100≤N≤999
 - N is an integer.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:  
N

-----Output-----
If N is a palindromic number, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
575

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

N=575 is also 575 when read backward, so it is a palindromic number. You should print Yes.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, you need to check if the number is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward in decimal notation.

To check if a number is a palindrome, you can convert it to a string and then check if the string is the same as the reversed string.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

1. Read the input number N from the standard input.
2. Convert N to a string.
3. Reverse the string.
4. Check if the original string and the reversed string are the same.
5. If they are the same, print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".

Here's an example of how you can implement this solution:

# Read the input number N from the standard input
N = int(input())

# Convert N to a string
N_str = str(N)

Alice and Bob are playing One Card Poker.

One Card Poker is a two-player game using playing cards.  
Each card in this game shows an integer between 1 and 13, inclusive.

The strength of a card is determined by the number written on it, as follows:  
Weak 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < 11 < 12 < 13 < 1 Strong  
One Card Poker is played as follows:  
 - Each player picks one card from the deck. The chosen card becomes the player's hand.
 - The players reveal their hands to each other. The player with the stronger card wins the game.
If their cards are equally strong, the game is drawn.  
You are watching Alice and Bob playing the game, and can see their hands.

The number written on Alice's card is A, and the number written on Bob's card is B.

Write a program to determine the outcome of the game.  

-----Constraints-----
 - 1≦A≦13 
 - 1≦B≦13 
 - A and B are integers.

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

-----Output-----
Print Alice if Alice will win. Print Bob if Bob will win. Print Draw if the game will be drawn.

-----Sample Input-----
8 6

-----Sample Output-----
Alice

8 is written on Alice's card, and 6 is written on Bob's card.
Alice has the stronger card, and thus the output should be Alice.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to compare the numbers written on Alice's and Bob's cards. If Alice's card has a number that is stronger than Bob's card, then Alice will win the game. If the numbers are equal, then the game will be drawn.

We can use a simple if-else statement to determine the outcome of the game. If Alice's card has a number that is stronger than Bob's card, then we print "Alice" as the outcome. If the numbers are equal, then we print "Draw". Otherwise, we print "Bob" as the outcome.

Here's the code:
```
# Read the numbers from the input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Compare the numbers
if a > b:
    print("Alice")
elif a == b:
    print("Draw")
else:
    print("Bob")
```
In this code, we first read the numbers from the input using the `map()` function and the `split()` method. We then compare the numbers using the `>` operator. If Alice's card has a number that is stronger than Bob's

happy newyear enjoy

Replace all the commas in happy,newyear,enjoy with spaces to obtain happy newyear enjoy.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to replace all the commas in the input string with spaces. We can do this by using the replace() method in JavaScript.

Here's the code:

const s = "happy,newyear,enjoy";
const newString = s.replace(",", " ");
console.log(newString);

The output will be:

There are N students and M checkpoints on the xy-plane.

The coordinates of the i-th student (1 \leq i \leq N) is (a_i,b_i), and the coordinates of the checkpoint numbered j (1 \leq j \leq M) is (c_j,d_j).

When the teacher gives a signal, each student has to go to the nearest checkpoint measured in Manhattan distance. 

The Manhattan distance between two points (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) is |x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2|.

Here, |x| denotes the absolute value of x.

If there are multiple nearest checkpoints for a student, he/she will select the checkpoint with the smallest index.

Which checkpoint will each student go to?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N,M \leq 50
 - -10^8 \leq a_i,b_i,c_j,d_j \leq 10^8
 - All input values are integers.

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M

-----Sample Input-----
2 2
2 0
0 0
-1 0

-----Sample Output-----

1

The Manhattan distance between the first student and each checkpoint is:
 - For checkpoint 1: |2-(-1)|+|0-0|=3
 - For checkpoint 2: |2-1|+|0-0|=1
The nearest checkpoint is checkpoint 2. Thus, the first line in the output should contain 2.
The Manhattan distance between the second student and each checkpoint is:
 - For checkpoint 1: |0-(-1)|+|0-0|=1
 - For checkpoint 2: |0-1|+|0-0|=1
When there are multiple nearest checkpoints, the student will go to the checkpoint with the smallest index. Thus, the second line in the output should contain 1.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the nearest checkpoint for each student. We can do this by calculating the Manhattan distance between each student and each checkpoint, and then selecting the checkpoint with the smallest Manhattan distance for each student.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input: The first line of the input contains the number of students (N) and the number of checkpoints (M). The next N lines contain the coordinates of the students, and the next M lines contain the coordinates of the checkpoints.
2. Calculate the Manhattan distance: For each student, calculate the Manhattan distance between the student's coordinates and each checkpoint's coordinates.
3. Find the nearest checkpoint: For each student, find the checkpoint with the smallest Manhattan distance.
4. Print the output: Print the index of the nearest checkpoint for each student.

Here's an example of how this would work for the sample input:

When a = 2, we have a + a^2 + a^3 = 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14.
Print the answer as an input. Outputs such as 14.0 will be judged as incorrect.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of a + a^2 + a^3.

First, we need to calculate a^2. We can do this by multiplying a by itself.

a^2 = a \* a

Next, we need to calculate a^3. We can do this by multiplying a^2 by a.

a^3 = a^2 \* a

Now, we can calculate the final result by adding a + a^2 + a^3.

a + a^2 + a^3 = a + a^2 + a^3

Finally, we print the result as an integer.

You are given an image A composed of N rows and N columns of pixels, and a template image B composed of M rows and M columns of pixels.

A pixel is the smallest element of an image, and in this problem it is a square of size 1×1.

Also, the given images are binary images, and the color of each pixel is either white or black.  
In the input, every pixel is represented by a character: . corresponds to a white pixel, and # corresponds to a black pixel.

The image A is given as N strings A_1,...,A_N.

The j-th character in the string A_i corresponds to the pixel at the i-th row and j-th column of the image A (1≦i,j≦N).

Similarly, the template image B is given as M strings B_1,...,B_M.

The j-th character in the string B_i corresponds to the pixel at the i-th row and j-th column of the template image B (1≦i,j≦M).  
Determine whether the template image B is contained in the image A when only parallel shifts can be applied to the images.

-----Sample Output-----

The template image B is identical to the upper-left 2 × 2 subimage and the lower-right 2 × 2 subimage of A. Thus, the output should be Yes.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find out if the template image B is contained in the image A when only parallel shifts can be applied to the images.

We can start by breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems. Let's consider the following sub-problems:

1. Given a string of characters, find the first occurrence of a pattern in the string.
2. Given two strings of characters, find the longest common substring between them.
3. Given two strings of characters, find the shortest distance between them.

We can use these sub-problems to solve the original problem.

Step 1: Find the first occurrence of the template image B in the image A.

We can use the first sub-problem to find the first occurrence of the template image B in the image A. We can start by finding the first occurrence of the first row of the template image B in the image A. If we find a match, we can move on to the next row of the template image B and repeat the process.

Step 2: Find the longest common substring between the template image B and the image A.

 - The player should construct a formula of the form X + Y, by arranging the four panels from left to right. (The operator panel should not be placed at either end of the formula.)

The amount of the allowance will be 53 when the panels are arranged as 52+1, and this is the maximum possible amount.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible value of the formula X + Y, where X and Y are the values printed on the integer panels.

Now, we need to find the maximum possible value of the formula X + Y. We can do this by considering all possible combinations of X and Y.

 - APC Ramen: takes D minutes to serve.
 - ATC Hanbagu (hamburger patty): takes E minutes to serve.
Here, the time to serve a dish is the time between when an order is placed and when the dish is delivered.
This restaurant has the following rules on orders:
 - An order can only be placed at a time that is a multiple of 10 (time 0, 10, 20, ...).
 - Only one dish can be ordered at a time.
 - No new order can be placed when an order is already placed and the dish is still not delivered, but a new order can be placed at the exact time when the dish is delivered.
E869120 arrives at this restaurant at time 0. He will order all five dishes. Find the earliest possible time for the last dish to be delivered.

Here, he can order the dishes in any order he likes, and he can place an order already at time 0.

-----Constraints-----
 - A, B, C, D and E are integers between 1 and 123 (inclusive).

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A
B
C
D
E

-----Output-----
Print the earliest possible time for the last dish to be delivered, as an integer.

-----Sample Input-----

120

-----Sample Output-----
215

If we decide to order the dishes in the order ABC Don, ARC Curry, AGC Pasta, ATC Hanbagu, APC Ramen, the earliest possible time for each order is as follows:
 - Order ABC Don at time 0, which will be delivered at time 29.
 - Order ARC Curry at time 30, which will be delivered at time 50.
 - Order AGC Pasta at time 50, which will be delivered at time 57.
 - Order ATC Hanbagu at time 60, which will be delivered at time 180.
 - Order APC Ramen at time 180, which will be delivered at time 215.
There is no way to order the dishes in which the last dish will be delivered earlier than this.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the earliest possible time for the last dish to be delivered. We can do this by considering the time it takes to serve each dish and the time it takes to place an order.

Let's consider the time it takes to serve each dish:

* ABC Don: 29 minutes
* ARC Curry: 50 minutes
* AGC Pasta: 57 minutes
* ATC Hanbagu: 180 minutes
* APC Ramen: 215 minutes

We can see that the last dish to be delivered is APC Ramen, which takes 215 minutes to serve.

Now, let's consider the time it takes to place an order:

* A: 0 minutes
* B: 10 minutes
* C: 20 minutes
* D: 30 minutes
* E: 40 minutes

We can see that the earliest possible time for an order to be placed is at time 0, 10, 20, 30, or 40 minutes.

Now, let's find the

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of the sum of the inverses of the given sequence of integers.

First, we can calculate the sum of the inverses of the given sequence as follows:

\frac{1}{A_1} + \frac{1}{A_2} +... + \frac{1}{A_N} = \frac{1}{A_1 + A_2 +... + A_N}

Next, we can find the multiplicative inverse of this sum by multiplying it by the denominator:

\frac{1}{\frac{1}{A_1} + \frac{1}{A_2} +... + \frac{1}{A_N}} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 +... + A_N}{1 + A_1 + A_2 +... + A_N}

Finally, we can simplify this expression by canceling out the common factor of A_1 + A_2 +... + A_N:

In some other world, today is Christmas Eve.
There are N trees planted in Mr. Takaha's garden. The height of the i-th tree (1 \leq i \leq N) is h_i meters.
He decides to choose K trees from these trees and decorate them with electric lights. To make the scenery more beautiful, the heights of the decorated trees should be as close to each other as possible.
More specifically, let the height of the tallest decorated tree be h_{max} meters, and the height of the shortest decorated tree be h_{min} meters. The smaller the value h_{max} - h_{min} is, the better. What is the minimum possible value of h_{max} - h_{min}?

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq K < N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq h_i \leq 10^9
 - h_i is an integer.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
h_1

-----Output-----
Print the minimum possible value of h_{max} - h_{min}.

-----Sample Input-----
5 3
10
15
11
14
12

-----Sample Output-----
2

If we decorate the first, third and fifth trees, h_{max} = 12, h_{min} = 10 so h_{max} - h_{min} = 2. This is optimal.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the minimum possible value of the difference between the heights of the tallest and shortest decorated trees.

To solve this problem, we need to find the K trees that are closest to each other in height. We can do this by sorting the heights of the trees in non-decreasing order and then selecting the first K trees.

For example, if we have 5 trees with heights 10, 15, 11, 14, and 12, and we want to decorate 3 trees, we would sort the heights in non-decreasing order to get 10, 11, 12, 14, 15. Then we would select the first 3 trees, which would be the tallest and shortest trees, and the difference between their heights would be 2.

Therefore, the minimum possible value of h_{max} - h_{min} is 2.

An uppercase or lowercase English letter \alpha will be given as input.
If \alpha is uppercase, print A; if it is lowercase, print a.

-----Constraints-----
 - \alpha is an uppercase (A - Z) or lowercase (a - z) English letter.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
α

-----Output-----
If \alpha is uppercase, print A; if it is lowercase, print a.

-----Sample Input-----
B

-----Sample Output-----
A

B is uppercase, so we should print A.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to take an input of an uppercase or lowercase English letter, and then print out the opposite letter. For example, if the input is "B", we should print "A" because "B" is uppercase. If the input is "b", we should print "a" because "b" is lowercase.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple if-else statement to check if the input is uppercase or lowercase. If the input is uppercase, we print "A". If the input is lowercase, we print "a".

Here's an example of how we can solve this problem:

```
# Get the input from the user
alpha = input()

# Check if the input is uppercase
if alpha.isupper():
    print("A")
else:
    print("a")
```

In this code, we first get the input from the user using the `input()` function. We then check if the input is uppercase using the `isupper()` method. If the input is uppercase, we print "A". If the input is lowercase, we print "a".

How many different assignments of values to X, Y and Z are there such that X + Y + Z = S?

-----Output-----

There are six triples of X, Y and Z that satisfy the condition:
 - X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 2 
 - X = 0, Y = 2, Z = 0 
 - X = 2, Y = 0, Z = 0 
 - X = 0, Y = 1, Z = 1 
 - X = 1, Y = 0, Z = 1 
 - X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 0

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of triples of X, Y, and Z that satisfy the condition X + Y + Z = S, where S is a given integer between 0 and 3K, and K is a given integer between 2 and 2500.

To solve this problem, we can use a brute force approach. We can iterate over all possible values of X, Y, and Z, and check if the sum of the three values is equal to S.

We can start by defining a function that takes three integers X, Y, and Z as input and returns true if the sum of the three values is equal to S, and false otherwise. We can then use a nested loop to iterate over all possible values of X, Y, and Z, and check if the sum of the three values is equal to S.

Here is an example of how we can implement this function in Python:
```
def is_valid_triple(x, y, z):
    return x + y + z == S

We can then use a nested loop to iterate over all possible values of X, Y, and Z, and check if the sum of the three values

You have a digit sequence S of length 4. You are wondering which of the following formats S is in:
 - YYMM format: the last two digits of the year and the two-digit representation of the month (example: 01 for January), concatenated in this order
 - MMYY format: the two-digit representation of the month and the last two digits of the year, concatenated in this order
If S is valid in only YYMM format, print YYMM; if S is valid in only MMYY format, print MMYY; if S is valid in both formats, print AMBIGUOUS; if S is valid in neither format, print NA.

-----Constraints-----
 - S is a digit sequence of length 4.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
Print the specified string: YYMM, MMYY, AMBIGUOUS or NA.

-----Sample Input-----
1905

-----Sample Output-----
YYMM

May XX19 is a valid date, but 19 is not valid as a month. Thus, this string is only valid in YYMM format.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to determine the format of a given digit sequence, which is either YYMM or MMYY. The sequence is given as a string of length 4.

To solve this problem, we can first check if the sequence is valid in the YYMM format. We can do this by checking if the last two digits of the sequence are a valid year and the two digits before them are a valid month. If the sequence is valid in this format, we print YYMM.

If the sequence is not valid in the YYMM format, we can check if it is valid in the MMYY format. We can do this by checking if the two digits before the last two digits of the sequence are a valid month and the last two digits are a valid year. If the sequence is valid in this format, we print MMYY.

If the sequence is valid in both YYMM and MMYY formats, we print AMBIGUOUS. If the sequence is not valid in either format, we print NA.

Here is an example of how this solution would work:

Output: YYMM

Two pairs can be chosen: (2,1) and (2,3).

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to choose a pair of an even number and an odd number from the positive integers between 1 and K (inclusive). Since the order does not matter, we can choose any even number and any odd number from the set of numbers between 1 and K.

Let's consider the case where K = 3. We can choose the even number from {2, 4} and the odd number from {1, 3}. Therefore, there are 2 ways to choose a pair of an even number and an odd number from the positive integers between 1 and 3 (inclusive).

Now, let's consider the case where K = 5. We can choose the even number from {2, 4, 6} and the odd number from {1, 3, 5}. Therefore, there are 3 ways to choose a pair of an even number and an odd number from the positive integers between 1 and 5 (inclusive).

To solve this problem, we need to find the time when the contest will begin.

We know that the current time is A o'clock, and the contest will begin in exactly B hours.

For example, if the current time is 9 o'clock, and the contest will begin in 12 hours, the time when the contest will begin will be 21 o'clock.

So, the solution is to add the number of hours to the current time to find the time when the contest will begin.

Takahashi is a member of a programming competition site, ButCoder.
Each member of ButCoder is assigned two values: Inner Rating and Displayed Rating.
The Displayed Rating of a member is equal to their Inner Rating if the member has participated in 10 or more contests. Otherwise, the Displayed Rating will be their Inner Rating minus 100 \times (10 - K) when the member has participated in K contests.
Takahashi has participated in N contests, and his Displayed Rating is R. Find his Inner Rating.

N R

-----Output-----

-----Sample Input-----

Takahashi has participated in 2 contests, which is less than 10, so his Displayed Rating is his Inner Rating minus 100 \times (10 - 2) = 800.
Thus, Takahashi's Inner Rating is 2919 + 800 = 3719.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the Inner Rating of Takahashi, given his Displayed Rating and the number of contests he has participated in. The Displayed Rating is calculated based on the number of contests he has participated in. If he has participated in 10 or more contests, his Displayed Rating is equal to his Inner Rating. Otherwise, his Displayed Rating is his Inner Rating minus 100 times the number of contests he has participated in.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of contests Takahashi has participated in. We can do this by subtracting his Displayed Rating from his Inner Rating. If the result is positive, then Takahashi has participated in 10 or more contests. If the result is negative, then he has participated in less than 10 contests.

Once we know the number of contests Takahashi has participated in, we can calculate his Inner Rating. If he has participated in 10 or more contests, his Inner Rating is equal to his Displayed Rating. Otherwise, his Inner Rating is his Displayed Rating minus 100 times the

-----Sample Output-----

In binary, 11 is represented as 1011.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of digits in the base-K representation of the integer N.

First, we need to convert N to base-K. We can do this by dividing N by K and taking the remainder. We repeat this process until N is 0.

For example, if N = 11 and K = 2, we would start by dividing 11 by 2, which gives us 5 with a remainder of 1. We would then divide 5 by 2, which gives us 2 with a remainder of 1. We would then divide 2 by 2, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 1. Finally, we would divide 1 by 2, which gives us 0 with a remainder of 1.

So, the base-2 representation of 11 is 1011. There are 4 digits in this representation.

Therefore, the number of digits in the base-K representation of N is 4.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of sheets of paper that Takahashi needs to print the document.

We know that two pages of data can be printed on one sheet of paper, so we need to divide the total number of pages by two.

Since N is an integer, we can round down the result to get the minimum number of sheets of paper needed.

So, the solution is to round down the result of dividing N by two.

The problem is asking whether E869120 and square1001 can take the desired number of pieces of cake without violating the rule that "the same person should not take two adjacent pieces of cake".

The rule states that the same person should not take two adjacent pieces of cake. This means that if E869120 wants to take A pieces of cake, then square1001 should not take B pieces of cake, where A and B are the numbers of pieces of cake that E869120 and square1001 want to take, respectively.

The master's favorite number is 753. The closer to this number, the better.
What is the minimum possible (absolute) difference between X and 753?

Taking out the seventh to ninth characters results in X = 787, and the difference between this and 753 is 787 - 753 = 34. The difference cannot be made smaller, no matter where X is taken from.
Note that the digits cannot be rearranged. For example, taking out 567 and rearranging it to 765 is not allowed.
We cannot take out three digits that are not consecutive from S, either. For example, taking out the seventh digit 7, the ninth digit 7 and the tenth digit 6 to obtain 776 is not allowed.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum difference between the number X formed by taking three consecutive digits from a given string S and the number 753. The constraints are that S is a string of length between 4 and 10, and each character in S is 1, 2,..., or 9.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum difference between X and 753. We can do this by finding the minimum difference between X and 753 for each possible position of the three consecutive digits in S.

Let's consider the first digit of S as 1, the second digit as 2, and the third digit as 3. We can form the number X by concatenating these three digits. For example, if S = "123456789", then X = 123.

Now, we need to find the minimum difference between X and 753. We can do this by finding the minimum difference between X and 753 for each possible position of the three consecutive digits in S.

Let's consider the first digit of S as 1, the second digit as 2, and

There were $n$ types of swords in the theater basement which had been used during the plays. Moreover there were exactly $x$ swords of each type. $y$ people have broken into the theater basement and each of them has taken exactly $z$ swords of some single type. Note that different people might have taken different types of swords. Note that the values $x, y$ and $z$ are unknown for you.

The next morning the director of the theater discovers the loss. He counts all swords — exactly $a_i$ swords of the $i$-th type are left untouched.

The director has no clue about the initial number of swords of each type in the basement, the number of people who have broken into the basement and how many swords each of them have taken.

For example, if $n=3$, $a = [3, 12, 6]$ then one of the possible situations is $x=12$, $y=5$ and $z=3$. Then the first three people took swords of the first type and the other two people took swords of the third type. Note that you don't know values $x, y$ and $z$ beforehand but know values of $n$ and $a$.

Thus he seeks for your help. Determine the minimum number of people $y$, which could have broken into the theater basement, and the number of swords $z$ each of them has taken.

It is guaranteed that there exists at least one such pair of indices $(j, k)$ that $a_j \neq a_k$.

In the first example the minimum value of $y$ equals to $5$, i.e. the minimum number of people who could have broken into the basement, is $5$. Each of them has taken $3$ swords: three of them have taken $3$ swords of the first type, and two others have taken $3$ swords of the third type.

In the second example the minimum value of $y$ is $1$, i.e. the minimum number of people who could have broken into the basement, equals to $1$. He has taken $7$ swords of the first type.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of people who could have broken into the basement and the number of swords each of them has taken, given the number of types of swords, the number of swords of each type that remained in the basement after the theft, and the number of swords each person has taken.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of people who could have broken into the basement and the number of swords each of them has taken, given that we have already broken into the basement and taken j swords of the i-th type.

We can initialize the table as follows:

* dp[i][0] = 1 for all i, since each person must take at least one sword of each type.
* dp[i][j] = 0 for all i and j such that a[i] < j, since it is not possible to take more swords of a particular type than the number of swords of that type that remained in the basement.

We can then fill in the remaining

Polycarp wants to train before another programming competition. During the first day of his training he should solve exactly $1$ problem, during the second day — exactly $2$ problems, during the third day — exactly $3$ problems, and so on. During the $k$-th day he should solve $k$ problems.

Polycarp has a list of $n$ contests, the $i$-th contest consists of $a_i$ problems. During each day Polycarp has to choose exactly one of the contests he didn't solve yet and solve it. He solves exactly $k$ problems from this contest. Other problems are discarded from it. If there are no contests consisting of at least $k$ problems that Polycarp didn't solve yet during the $k$-th day, then Polycarp stops his training.

How many days Polycarp can train if he chooses the contests optimally?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of contests.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of problems in the $i$-th contest.

The problem is to find the maximum number of days that Polycarp can train if he chooses the contests optimally.

Let's consider the $k$-th day. On this day, Polycarp should solve exactly $k$ problems. He can choose one of the contests that he didn't solve yet and solve exactly $k$ problems from it. If there are no contests that Polycarp didn't solve yet and have at least $k$ problems, then Polycarp stops his training.

Let's denote the number of contests that Polycarp didn't solve yet and have at least $k$ problems as $c_k$. We want to find the maximum value of $c_k$.

If $k = 1$, then Polycarp can solve exactly one problem from any contest, so $c_1 = n$.

If $k > 1$, then we can find the maximum value of $c_k$ by considering the following cases:

You are given a forest — an undirected graph with $n$ vertices such that each its connected component is a tree.

The diameter (aka "longest shortest path") of a connected undirected graph is the maximum number of edges in the shortest path between any pair of its vertices.

You task is to add some edges (possibly zero) to the graph so that it becomes a tree and the diameter of the tree is minimal possible.

If there are multiple correct answers, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$, $0 \le m \le n - 1$) — the number of vertices of the graph and the number of edges, respectively.

Each of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $v$ and $u$ ($1 \le v, u \le n$, $v \ne u$) — the descriptions of the edges.

It is guaranteed that the given graph is a forest.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the diameter of the resulting tree.

Each of the next $(n - 1) - m$ lines should contain two integers $v$ and $u$ ($1 \le v, u \le n$, $v \ne u$) — the descriptions of the added edges.

The resulting graph should be a tree and its diameter should be minimal possible.

For $m = n - 1$ no edges are added, thus the output consists of a single integer — diameter of the given tree.

If there are multiple correct answers, print any of them.

-----Note-----

In the first example adding edges (1, 4) or (3, 4) will lead to a total diameter of 3. Adding edge (2, 4), however, will make it 2.

Edge (1, 2) is the only option you have for the second example. The diameter is 1.

You can't add any edges in the third example. The diameter is already 2.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum diameter of a tree that can be formed by adding edges to a given forest. The given forest is an undirected graph with $n$ vertices such that each connected component is a tree. The diameter of a connected undirected graph is the maximum number of edges in the shortest path between any pair of its vertices.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum diameter of a tree that can be formed by adding edges to the given forest. We can do this by finding the minimum diameter of each tree in the forest and then adding the edges that connect the trees to form a single tree with the minimum diameter.

To find the minimum diameter of each tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. We start at a vertex in the tree and then explore all the vertices that are reachable from it. We keep track of the minimum diameter of each tree as we explore it. When we reach a vertex that is not in any tree, we add it to the tree that has the minimum diameter.

Once we have found the minimum diameter of each tree, we can add the edges that connect the trees to form a single tree with the minimum diameter. We can

You are given a tree, which consists of $n$ vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.  [Image] Example of a tree. 

Vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$. All vertices have weights, the weight of the vertex $v$ is $a_v$.

Recall that the distance between two vertices in the tree is the number of edges on a simple path between them.

Your task is to find the subset of vertices with the maximum total weight (the weight of the subset is the sum of weights of all vertices in it) such that there is no pair of vertices with the distance $k$ or less between them in this subset.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, k \le 200$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the distance restriction, respectively.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the weight of the vertex $i$.

The next $n - 1$ lines contain edges of the tree. Edge $i$ is denoted by two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$ — the labels of vertices it connects ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $u_i \ne v_i$).

It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the subset of vertices with the maximum total weight such that there is no pair of vertices with the distance $k$ or less between them in this subset.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by selecting the vertex with the maximum weight and adding it to the subset. We then consider the remaining vertices and add them to the subset if they are not connected to any vertex in the subset with a distance of $k$ or less.

We repeat this process until we have selected all the vertices. We then calculate the total weight of the subset and return it as the answer.

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the tree. This is because we need to consider all the vertices in the tree and check if they are connected to any vertex in the subset with a distance of $k$ or less.

The space complexity of this algorithm is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the tree. This is because we need to store the subset of vertices in memory.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize an empty subset.

There are $n$ dormitories in Berland State University, they are numbered with integers from $1$ to $n$. Each dormitory consists of rooms, there are $a_i$ rooms in $i$-th dormitory. The rooms in $i$-th dormitory are numbered from $1$ to $a_i$.

A postman delivers letters. Sometimes there is no specific dormitory and room number in it on an envelope. Instead of it only a room number among all rooms of all $n$ dormitories is written on an envelope. In this case, assume that all the rooms are numbered from $1$ to $a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n$ and the rooms of the first dormitory go first, the rooms of the second dormitory go after them and so on.

For example, in case $n=2$, $a_1=3$ and $a_2=5$ an envelope can have any integer from $1$ to $8$ written on it. If the number $7$ is written on an envelope, it means that the letter should be delivered to the room number $4$ of the second dormitory.

For each of $m$ letters by the room number among all $n$ dormitories, determine the particular dormitory and the room number in a dormitory where this letter should be delivered.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ $(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^{5})$ — the number of dormitories and the number of letters.

The second line contains a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ $(1 \le a_i \le 10^{10})$, where $a_i$ equals to the number of rooms in the $i$-th dormitory. The third line contains a sequence $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$ $(1 \le b_j \le a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n)$, where $b_j$ equals to the room number (among all rooms of all dormitories) for the $j$-th letter. All $b_j$ are given in increasing order.


-----Output-----

Print $m$ lines. For each letter print two integers $f$ and $k$ — the dormitory number $f$ $(1 \le f \le n)$ and the room number $k$ in this dormitory $(1 \le k \le a_f)$ to deliver the letter.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the dormitory and room number for each letter, given the room number among all rooms of all dormitories. We can solve this problem by creating a mapping between the room number and the dormitory and room number.

We can do this by first creating a list of all the room numbers in the order they appear in the sequence of letters. We can then create a dictionary where the key is the room number and the value is a tuple containing the dormitory number and the room number in that dormitory.

For example, if we have 3 dormitories with 10, 15, and 12 rooms respectively, the list of room numbers would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26].

The dictionary would look like this:

Polycarp has guessed three positive integers $a$, $b$ and $c$. He keeps these numbers in secret, but he writes down four numbers on a board in arbitrary order — their pairwise sums (three numbers) and sum of all three numbers (one number). So, there are four numbers on a board in random order: $a+b$, $a+c$, $b+c$ and $a+b+c$.

You have to guess three numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$ using given numbers. Print three guessed integers in any order.

Pay attention that some given numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$ can be equal (it is also possible that $a=b=c$).


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains four positive integers $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ ($2 \le x_i \le 10^9$) — numbers written on a board in random order. It is guaranteed that the answer exists for the given number $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$.


-----Output-----

Print such positive integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ that four numbers written on a board are values $a+b$, $a+c$, $b+c$ and $a+b+c$ written in some order. Print $a$, $b$ and $c$ in any order. If there are several answers, you can print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find three positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that the four numbers written on a board are the pairwise sums of $a$, $b$, and $c$ and the sum of all three numbers.

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. Write down the four numbers on a board in the order $a+b$, $a+c$, $b+c$, and $a+b+c$.
2. Observe that the sum of the first three numbers is equal to the sum of the last three numbers.
3. Therefore, we can find the missing number $a+b+c$ by subtracting the sum of the first three numbers from the sum of the last three numbers.
4. Now, we have two equations:

$a+b+c = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4$

$a+b+c = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 - (x_1 + x_2 + x_3)$

Solving these equations, we get:

You have a garland consisting of $n$ lamps. Each lamp is colored red, green or blue. The color of the $i$-th lamp is $s_i$ ('R', 'G' and 'B' — colors of lamps in the garland).

You have to recolor some lamps in this garland (recoloring a lamp means changing its initial color to another) in such a way that the obtained garland is diverse.

A garland is called diverse if any two adjacent (consecutive) lamps (i. e. such lamps that the distance between their positions is $1$) have distinct colors.

In other words, if the obtained garland is $t$ then for each $i$ from $1$ to $n-1$ the condition $t_i \ne t_{i + 1}$ should be satisfied.

Among all ways to recolor the initial garland to make it diverse you have to choose one with the minimum number of recolored lamps. If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of lamps.

The problem is to find the minimum number of recolors needed to make a garland diverse. A garland is diverse if any two adjacent lamps have distinct colors.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by recoloring the garland one lamp at a time. At each step, we can choose the next lamp to recolor based on the following criteria:

1. If the current lamp is not colored, we can recolor it to any color.
2. If the current lamp is colored, we can recolor it to a different color than its current color.

We can keep track of the number of recolors needed to make the garland diverse. We can also keep track of the diverse garland that we have constructed so far.

At each step, we can check if the garland is diverse. If it is, we can stop. If it is not, we can continue recoloring the garland until it is diverse.

The time complexity of this approach is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of lamps in the garland. The space complexity is $O(1)$, since we only need to keep track of

You have to choose some subsequence of this array of maximum length such that this subsequence forms a increasing sequence of consecutive integers. In other words the required sequence should be equal to $[x, x + 1, \dots, x + k - 1]$ for some value $x$ and length $k$.

Subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array. You can erase any elements, not necessarily going successively. The remaining elements preserve their order. For example, for the array $[5, 3, 1, 2, 4]$ the following arrays are subsequences: $[3]$, $[5, 3, 1, 2, 4]$, $[5, 1, 4]$, but the array $[1, 3]$ is not.

We can initialize dp[i][i] = 1 for all i, as the subsequence of length 1 ending at the ith element is valid.

We can then fill in the rest of the dp array using the following recurrence relation:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][k] + 1) for all k from i to j - 1 such that a[k] < a[j]

This recurrence relation states that the maximum length of the subsequence ending at the jth element is the maximum of the lengths of all subsequences ending at the kth element, where k is

To solve this problem, we need to find an integer C between 1 and 3 such that A \* B \* C is an odd number.

We know that A, B, and C are all between 1 and 3, inclusive. Therefore, we can start by checking all possible values of C: 1, 2, and 3.

If we check C = 1, we get A \* B \* C = 3 \* 1 \* 1 = 3, which is an odd number.

If we check C = 2, we get A \* B \* C = 3 \* 1 \* 2 = 6, which is an even number.

If we check C = 3, we get A \* B \* C = 3 \* 1 \* 3 = 9, which is an odd number.

Therefore, we can conclude that there is an integer C between 1 and 3 that satisfies the condition, and we can print "Yes".

Next, we consider the second digit. Since it must be a digit between 1 and N (inclusive), we have a total of N possible choices for the second digit.

Finally, we consider the third digit. Since it must be a digit between 1 and N (inclusive), we have a total of N possible choices for the third digit.

Therefore, the total number of possible passwords is N x N x N = N^3.

So, the answer is 8.

Shichi-Go-San (literally "Seven-Five-Three") is a traditional event in a certain country to celebrate the growth of seven-, five- and three-year-old children.
Takahashi is now X years old. Will his growth be celebrated in Shichi-Go-San this time?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 ≤ X ≤ 9
 - X is an integer.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X

-----Output-----
If Takahashi's growth will be celebrated, print YES; if it will not, print NO.

-----Sample Input-----
5

-----Sample Output-----
YES

The growth of a five-year-old child will be celebrated.

-----Plan-----
To determine if Takahashi's growth will be celebrated in Shichi-Go-San, we need to check if his age is a multiple of 3, 5, or 7.

If Takahashi is 5 years old, his age is a multiple of 5, so his growth will be celebrated in Shichi-Go-San.

If Takahashi is 9 years old, his age is not a multiple of 3, 5, or 7, so his growth will not be celebrated in Shichi-Go-San.

Therefore, the solution is to check if Takahashi's age is a multiple of 3, 5, or 7. If it is, print YES, otherwise print NO.

Decades have passed since the beginning of AtCoder Beginner Contest.
The contests are labeled as ABC001, ABC002, ... from the first round, but after the 999-th round ABC999, a problem occurred: how the future rounds should be labeled?
In the end, the labels for the rounds from the 1000-th to the 1998-th are decided: ABD001, ABD002, ..., ABD999.
You are given an integer N between 1 and 1998 (inclusive). Print the first three characters of the label of the N-th round of AtCoder Beginner Contest.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 1998
 - N is an integer.

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

-----Output-----
Print the first three characters of the label of the N-th round of AtCoder Beginner Contest.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----
ABC

The 999-th round of AtCoder Beginner Contest is labeled as ABC999.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to print the first three characters of the label of the N-th round of AtCoder Beginner Contest. The label of the N-th round is determined by the following formula:

ABD + (N - 1000)

where ABD is the first three characters of the label of the 1000-th round of the contest.

For example, if the label of the 1000-th round is ABC, then the label of the 999-th round is ABD.

Therefore, the first three characters of the label of the N-th round is determined by the following formula:

ABD + (N - 1000)

where ABD is the first three characters of the label of the 1000-th round of the contest.

So, to solve the problem, you need to find the first three characters of the label of the 1000-th round of the contest, which is ABC. Then, you need to add (N - 1000) to the label of the 1000-th round,

In AtCoder city, there are five antennas standing in a straight line. They are called Antenna A, B, C, D and E from west to east, and their coordinates are a, b, c, d and e, respectively.

Two antennas can communicate directly if the distance between them is k or less, and they cannot if the distance is greater than k.

Determine if there exists a pair of antennas that cannot communicate directly.

Here, assume that the distance between two antennas at coordinates p and q (p < q) is q - p.  

-----Constraints-----
 - a, b, c, d, e and k are integers between 0 and 123 (inclusive).
 - a < b < c < d < e

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
a
b
c

-----Output-----
Print :( if there exists a pair of antennas that cannot communicate directly, and print Yay! if there is no such pair.

-----Sample Input-----
1
2
4
8
9
15

-----Sample Output-----
Yay!

In this case, there is no pair of antennas that cannot communicate directly, because:
 - the distance between A and B is 2 - 1 = 1
 - the distance between A and C is 4 - 1 = 3
 - the distance between A and D is 8 - 1 = 7
 - the distance between A and E is 9 - 1 = 8
 - the distance between B and C is 4 - 2 = 2
 - the distance between B and D is 8 - 2 = 6
 - the distance between B and E is 9 - 2 = 7
 - the distance between C and D is 8 - 4 = 4
 - the distance between C and E is 9 - 4 = 5
 - the distance between D and E is 9 - 8 = 1
and none of them is greater than 15. Thus, the correct output is Yay!.

-----Plan-----
This problem is asking us to determine if there exists a pair of antennas in the straight line that cannot communicate directly. We are given the coordinates of the five antennas and the value of k, which is the maximum distance between two antennas that can communicate directly.

To solve this problem, we need to check if there exists a pair of antennas that have a distance greater than k between them. We can do this by checking the distances between each pair of antennas. If there is a pair of antennas that have a distance greater than k between them, then we know that they cannot communicate directly.

We can start by checking the distances between the first two antennas, A and B. If the distance between them is greater than k, then we know that they cannot communicate directly. We can then move on to the next pair of antennas, C and D, and check the distance between them. If the distance between them is greater than k, then we know that they cannot communicate directly. We can continue this process until we have checked all possible pairs of antennas.

If we find a pair of antennas that have a distance greater than k between them, then we know that there exists a pair of antennas that

You will be given an integer a and a string s consisting of lowercase English letters as input.
Write a program that prints s if a is not less than 3200 and prints red if a is less than 3200.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2800 \leq a < 5000
 - s is a string of length between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
 - Each character of s is a lowercase English letter.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

-----Output-----
If a is not less than 3200, print s; if a is less than 3200, print red.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----
pink

a = 3200 is not less than 3200, so we print s = pink.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to write a program that takes an integer a and a string s as input and prints s if a is not less than 3200, and prints "red" if a is less than 3200.

The constraints are:

* 2800 <= a < 5000
* s is a string of length between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
* Each character of s is a lowercase English letter.

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

The output is the string s if a is not less than 3200, and "red" if a is less than 3200.

For example, if the input is:

The output should be:

pink

Because a = 3200 is not less than 3200, so we print s = pink.

R

-----Output-----
Print the name of the next contest rated for Takahashi (ABC, ARC or AGC).

-----Sample Input-----
1199

-----Sample Output-----
ABC

1199 is less than 1200, so ABC will be rated.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the next contest rated for Takahashi based on his rating.

We know that the next contest after ABC is ARC, which is rated for contestants with ratings less than 2800.

We also know that the next contest after ARC is AGC, which is rated for all contestants.

So, if Takahashi's rating is less than 1200, the next contest rated for him is ABC.

If Takahashi's rating is less than 2800, the next contest rated for him is ARC.

If Takahashi's rating is greater than or equal to 2800, the next contest rated for him is AGC.

Therefore, we can write a program that checks Takahashi's rating and prints the name of the next contest rated for him based on his rating.

Cat Snuke is learning to write characters.
Today, he practiced writing digits 1 and 9, but he did it the other way around.
You are given a three-digit integer n written by Snuke.
Print the integer obtained by replacing each digit 1 with 9 and each digit 9 with 1 in n.

n

-----Output-----
Print the integer obtained by replacing each occurrence of 1 with 9 and each occurrence of 9 with 1 in n.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----
991

Replace the 9 in the ones place with 1, the 1 in the tens place with 9 and the 1 in the hundreds place with 9. The answer is 991.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to replace each digit 1 with 9 and each digit 9 with 1 in the given integer n.

First, we need to find the position of each digit 1 and 9 in the integer. We can do this by using the modulo operator (%) to get the remainder of dividing the integer by 10.

For example, if n = 119, we can find the position of the digit 1 by doing:

n % 10 = 1

This tells us that the digit 1 is in the ones place.

We can also find the position of the digit 9 by doing:

n / 10 = 11

This tells us that the digit 9 is in the tens place.

Now, we need to replace each digit 1 with 9 and each digit 9 with 1 in the integer. We can do this by using the modulo operator (%) to get the remainder of dividing the integer by 10, and then using the division operator (/) to get the quotient of dividing the integer by 10.

Alice guesses the strings that Bob made for her.

At first, Bob came up with the secret string $a$ consisting of lowercase English letters. The string $a$ has a length of $2$ or more characters. Then, from string $a$ he builds a new string $b$ and offers Alice the string $b$ so that she can guess the string $a$.

Bob builds $b$ from $a$ as follows: he writes all the substrings of length $2$ of the string $a$ in the order from left to right, and then joins them in the same order into the string $b$.

For example, if Bob came up with the string $a$="abac", then all the substrings of length $2$ of the string $a$ are: "ab", "ba", "ac". Therefore, the string $b$="abbaac".

You are given the string $b$. Help Alice to guess the string $a$ that Bob came up with. It is guaranteed that $b$ was built according to the algorithm given above. It can be proved that the answer to the problem is unique.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases in the test. Then $t$ test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line in which the string $b$ is written, consisting of lowercase English letters ($2 \le |b| \le 100$) — the string Bob came up with, where $|b|$ is the length of the string $b$. It is guaranteed that $b$ was built according to the algorithm given above.


-----Output-----

Output $t$ answers to test cases. Each answer is the secret string $a$, consisting of lowercase English letters, that Bob came up with.


-----Example-----
Input
4
abbaac
ac
bccddaaf
zzzzzzzzzz

Output
abac
ac
bcdaf
zzzzzz



-----Note-----

The first test case is explained in the statement.

In the second test case, Bob came up with the string $a$="ac", the string $a$ has a length $2$, so the string $b$ is equal to the string $a$.

In the third test case, Bob came up with the string $a$="bcdaf", substrings of length $2$ of string $a$ are: "bc", "cd", "da", "af", so the string $b$="bccddaaf".

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the original string $a$ that Bob used to build the string $b$. We can do this by finding the substrings of length $2$ in the string $b$ and then reconstructing the original string $a$ from these substrings.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input string $b$ from the input.
2. Find all the substrings of length $2$ in the string $b$. For example, if the input string is "bccddaaf", the substrings are "bc", "cc", "dd", "da", "af".
3. Sort the substrings in lexicographic order. For example, the sorted substrings are "af", "bc", "cc", "dd", "da".
4. Concatenate the sorted substrings to form the original string $a$. For example, if the sorted substrings are "af", "bc", "cc", "dd", "da", the original string $a$ is "abccddaaf".
5. Output the original string $a$.

Note that the sorted substrings are guaranteed to

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves required to make $a$ divisible by $b$. We can do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $a$ and $b$.

The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. In other words, it is the largest number that divides both $a$ and $b$ without leaving a remainder.

To find the GCD of $a$ and $b$, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm is a way of finding the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0.

For example, to find the GCD of $10$ and $12$, we can start by subtracting $12$ from $10$ to get $2$. Then we subtract $2$ from $10$ to get $8$. Then we subtract $8$ from $12$ to get $4$. Finally, we subtract $4$ from $12$ to get $8$, which means that $10$ and $12$ have a

The heat during the last few days has been really intense. Scientists from all over the Berland study how the temperatures and weather change, and they claim that this summer is abnormally hot. But any scientific claim sounds a lot more reasonable if there are some numbers involved, so they have decided to actually calculate some value which would represent how high the temperatures are.

Mathematicians of Berland State University came up with a special heat intensity value. This value is calculated as follows:

Suppose we want to analyze the segment of $n$ consecutive days. We have measured the temperatures during these $n$ days; the temperature during $i$-th day equals $a_i$.

We denote the average temperature of a segment of some consecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during this segment of days. So, if we want to analyze the average temperature from day $x$ to day $y$, we calculate it as $\frac{\sum \limits_{i = x}^{y} a_i}{y - x + 1}$ (note that division is performed without any rounding). The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days. For example, if analyzing the measures $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ and $k = 3$, we are interested in segments $[3, 4, 1]$, $[4, 1, 2]$ and $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ (we want to find the maximum value of average temperature over these segments).

You have been hired by Berland State University to write a program that would compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days. Are you up to this task?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 5000$) — the number of days in the given period, and the minimum number of days in a segment we consider when calculating heat intensity value, respectively.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 5000$) — the temperature measures during given $n$ days.


-----Output-----

Print one real number — the heat intensity value, i. e., the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days.

Your answer will be considered correct if the following condition holds: $|res - res_0| < 10^{-6}$, where $res$ is your answer, and $res_0$ is the answer given by the jury's solution.


-----Example-----
Input
4 3
3 4 1 2

Output
2.666666666666667

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days. The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days.

To solve this problem, you need to first calculate the average temperature for each segment of $k$ consecutive days. You can do this by taking the average of the temperatures for each segment. For example, if the temperatures are $3, 4, 1, 2$, and $k = 3$, the average temperatures for each segment of $k = 3$ consecutive days are $3, 4, 2.5, 2.666666666666667$.

Next, you need to find the maximum of these average temperatures. In this case, the maximum average temperature is $2.666666666666667$.

So, the heat intensity value is $2.666666666666667$.

You are given an array $a$ of length $n$.

You are also given a set of distinct positions $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m$, where $1 \le p_i < n$. The position $p_i$ means that you can swap elements $a[p_i]$ and $a[p_i + 1]$. You can apply this operation any number of times for each of the given positions.

Your task is to determine if it is possible to sort the initial array in non-decreasing order ($a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_n$) using only allowed swaps.

For example, if $a = [3, 2, 1]$ and $p = [1, 2]$, then we can first swap elements $a[2]$ and $a[3]$ (because position $2$ is contained in the given set $p$). We get the array $a = [3, 1, 2]$. Then we swap $a[1]$ and $a[2]$ (position $1$ is also contained in $p$). We get the array $a = [1, 3, 2]$. Finally, we swap $a[2]$ and $a[3]$ again and get the array $a = [1, 2, 3]$, sorted in non-decreasing order.

You can see that if $a = [4, 1, 2, 3]$ and $p = [3, 2]$ then you cannot sort the array.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases.

Then $t$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le m < n \le 100$) — the number of elements in $a$ and the number of elements in $p$. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$). The third line of the test case contains $m$ integers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m$ ($1 \le p_i < n$, all $p_i$ are distinct) — the set of positions described in the problem statement.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer — "YES" (without quotes) if you can sort the initial array in non-decreasing order ($a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_n$) using only allowed swaps. Otherwise, print "NO".

The problem is asking us to determine if it is possible to sort an array of integers in non-decreasing order using only allowed swaps. An allowed swap is when we swap two adjacent elements in the array.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by sorting the array in non-decreasing order. Then, we iterate through the array and for each position $i$, we check if it is possible to swap the element at position $i$ with the element at position $i+1$. If it is possible, we swap the elements and continue to the next position. If it is not possible, we stop and print "NO".

Polycarp loves ciphers. He has invented his own cipher called repeating.

Repeating cipher is used for strings. To encrypt the string $s=s_{1}s_{2} \dots s_{m}$ ($1 \le m \le 10$), Polycarp uses the following algorithm:

  he writes down $s_1$ ones,  he writes down $s_2$ twice,  he writes down $s_3$ three times,  ...  he writes down $s_m$ $m$ times. 

For example, if $s$="bab" the process is: "b" $\to$ "baa" $\to$ "baabbb". So the encrypted $s$="bab" is "baabbb".

Given string $t$ — the result of encryption of some string $s$. Your task is to decrypt it, i. e. find the string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 55$) — the length of the encrypted string. The second line of the input contains $t$ — the result of encryption of some string $s$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters. The length of $t$ is exactly $n$.

It is guaranteed that the answer to the test exists.


-----Output-----

Print such string $s$ that after encryption it equals $t$.


-----Examples-----

Output
bab
Input

ooopppssss

Output
oops
Input

z

Output
z

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the original string that was encrypted using Polycarp's repeating cipher. The encryption process involves writing each letter of the original string a certain number of times, where the number is equal to the position of the letter in the original string. For example, if the original string is "bab", the encryption process would be: "b" $\to$ "baa" $\to$ "baabbb".

To decrypt the encrypted string $t$, we need to find the original string $s$ such that the encryption process of $s$ gives $t$. We can do this by trying all possible strings of length $n$, where $n$ is the length of the encrypted string $t$. For each string $s$, we can calculate the encryption of $s$ using Polycarp's algorithm, and compare it with $t$. If the encryption of $s$ is equal to $t$, then we have found the original string $s$.

Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:

1. Read the input: The first line of the input contains the length of the encrypted string $n$, and the second line contains the encrypted string $t$.

A minimum spanning tree (MST) in case of positive weights is a subset of the edges of a connected weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together and has minimum total cost among all such subsets (total cost is the sum of costs of chosen edges).

You can modify the given graph. The only operation you can perform is the following: increase the weight of some edge by $1$. You can increase the weight of each edge multiple (possibly, zero) times.

Suppose that the initial MST cost is $k$. Your problem is to increase weights of some edges with minimum possible number of operations in such a way that the cost of MST in the obtained graph remains $k$, but MST is unique (it means that there is only one way to choose MST in the obtained graph).

Your problem is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to do it.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, n - 1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the initial graph.

The next $m$ lines contain three integers each. The $i$-th line contains the description of the $i$-th edge $e_i$. It is denoted by three integers $u_i, v_i$ and $w_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n, u_i \ne v_i, 1 \le w \le 10^9$), where $u_i$ and $v_i$ are vertices connected by the $i$-th edge and $w_i$ is the weight of this edge.

It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain loops and multiple edges (i.e. for each $i$ from $1$ to $m$ $u_i \ne v_i$ and for each unordered pair of vertices $(u, v)$ there is at most one edge connecting this pair of vertices). It is also guaranteed that the given graph is connected.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum number of operations to unify MST of the initial graph without changing the cost of MST.

-----Note-----

The picture corresponding to the first example: [Image]

You can, for example, increase weight of the edge $(1, 6)$ or $(6, 3)$ by $1$ to unify MST.

The picture corresponding to the last example: $\$ 8$

You can, for example, increase weights of edges $(1, 5)$ and $(2, 4)$ by $1$ to unify MST.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the weight of some edges in the graph by $1$ such that the cost of the minimum spanning tree remains the same.

To solve this problem, we can use a technique called "shortest augmenting path". The idea is to find a path in the graph that connects two vertices with different weights, and then increase the weight of the edges along this path by $1$. This will result in a new minimum spanning tree with the same cost as the original tree, but with unique edges.

To find the shortest augmenting path, we can use a modified version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. The modified algorithm starts at a source vertex and repeatedly finds the shortest path from the source to all other vertices in the graph. The path is augmented by increasing the weight of the edges along the path by $1$. The algorithm stops when there are no more edges to augment.

The time complexity of the modified Bellman-Ford algorithm is $O(m + n\log n)$, where $m$ is the number of edges and $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. This is because the algorithm needs to visit

You have a garland consisting of $n$ lamps. Each lamp is colored red, green or blue. The color of the $i$-th lamp is $s_i$ ('R', 'G' and 'B' — colors of lamps in the garland).

You have to recolor some lamps in this garland (recoloring a lamp means changing its initial color to another) in such a way that the obtained garland is nice.

A garland is called nice if any two lamps of the same color have distance divisible by three between them. I.e. if the obtained garland is $t$, then for each $i, j$ such that $t_i = t_j$ should be satisfied $|i-j|~ mod~ 3 = 0$. The value $|x|$ means absolute value of $x$, the operation $x~ mod~ y$ means remainder of $x$ when divided by $y$.

For example, the following garlands are nice: "RGBRGBRG", "GB", "R", "GRBGRBG", "BRGBRGB". The following garlands are not nice: "RR", "RGBG".

Among all ways to recolor the initial garland to make it nice you have to choose one with the minimum number of recolored lamps. If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of lamps.

The second line of the input contains the string $s$ consisting of $n$ characters 'R', 'G' and 'B' — colors of lamps in the garland.


-----Output-----

In the first line of the output print one integer $r$ — the minimum number of recolors needed to obtain a nice garland from the given one.

In the second line of the output print one string $t$ of length $n$ — a nice garland obtained from the initial one with minimum number of recolors. If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of recolors needed to make a garland nice. A garland is nice if any two lamps of the same color have distance divisible by three between them.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by coloring the first lamp red. Then, we color the second lamp green if it is not the same color as the first lamp. If it is the same color, we color it blue. We continue this process until we have colored all the lamps.

We can prove that this algorithm is correct by showing that it always produces a nice garland. Suppose we have colored the first $i$ lamps in the garland with colors $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_i$. We want to color the $i+1$th lamp. If it is the same color as the $i$th lamp, we can color it the same color. Otherwise, we can color it the opposite color.

Suppose we have colored the first $i$ lamps with colors $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_i$ and we want to color the $i+1$th

Takahashi received otoshidama (New Year's money gifts) from N of his relatives.
You are given N values x_1, x_2, ..., x_N and N strings u_1, u_2, ..., u_N as input. Each string u_i is either JPY or BTC, and x_i and u_i represent the content of the otoshidama from the i-th relative.
For example, if x_1 = 10000 and u_1 = JPY, the otoshidama from the first relative is 10000 Japanese yen; if x_2 = 0.10000000 and u_2 = BTC, the otoshidama from the second relative is 0.1 bitcoins.
If we convert the bitcoins into yen at the rate of 380000.0 JPY per 1.0 BTC, how much are the gifts worth in total?

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10
 - u_i = JPY or BTC.
 - If u_i = JPY, x_i is an integer such that 1 \leq x_i \leq 10^8.
 - If u_i = BTC, x_i is a decimal with 8 decimal digits, such that 0.00000001 \leq x_i \leq 100.00000000.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
x_1 u_1
x_2 u_2
:
x_N u_N

-----Output-----
If the gifts are worth Y yen in total, print the value Y (not necessarily an integer).
Output will be judged correct when the absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-5}.

-----Sample Input-----
2
10000 JPY
0.10000000 BTC

-----Sample Output-----
48000.0

The otoshidama from the first relative is 10000 yen. The otoshidama from the second relative is 0.1 bitcoins, which is worth 38000.0 yen if converted at the rate of 380000.0 JPY per 1.0 BTC. The sum of these is 48000.0 yen.
Outputs such as 48000 and 48000.1 will also be judged correct.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to convert the bitcoins into yen at the rate of 380000.0 JPY per 1.0 BTC. We can do this by multiplying the number of bitcoins by the conversion rate.

For example, if we have 0.10000000 bitcoins, we can convert it to yen by multiplying it by 380000.0, which gives us 38000.0 yen.

We can then add up the total value of all the gifts in yen. In this case, the total value is 10000 + 38000.0 = 48000.0 yen.

Therefore, the total value of all the gifts is 48000.0 yen.

The second car from the front of a 4-car train is the third car from the back.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the value of j such that the i-th car from the front of the train is the j-th car from the back.

To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the position of the i-th car from the front and the position of the j-th car from the back.

Let's say the train has N cars, and we want to find the value of j such that the i-th car from the front is the j-th car from the back.

We can start by finding the position of the i-th car from the front. Since the first car is at position 1, the i-th car from the front would be at position i.

Next, we need to find the position of the j-th car from the back. Since the last car is at position N, the j-th car from the back would be at position N - j + 1.

Now, we need to find the difference between the position of the i-th car from the front and the position of the j-th car from the back. This difference is the value of j we are looking for.

So, the solution

We have weather records at AtCoder Town for some consecutive three days. A string of length 3, S, represents the records - if the i-th character is S, it means it was sunny on the i-th day; if that character is R, it means it was rainy on that day.
Find the maximum number of consecutive rainy days in this period.

S

-----Output-----

RRS

-----Sample Output-----

We had rain on the 1-st and 2-nd days in the period. Here, the maximum number of consecutive rainy days is 2, so we should print 2.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the maximum number of consecutive rainy days in a period of three days. The input is a string of length 3, where each character is either 'S' or 'R'. If the character is 'S', it means it was sunny on that day, and if it is 'R', it means it was rainy on that day.

To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the number of consecutive rainy days. We can do this by using a variable to keep track of the number of consecutive rainy days, and by using a flag to indicate whether the current day is rainy or not.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the number of consecutive rainy days to 0.
2. Initialize the flag to false.
3. For each character in the input string:
	* If the character is 'R', set the flag to true.
	* If the character is 'S', set the flag to false.
	* If the flag is true, increment the number of consecutive rainy days.

Takahashi is 30 years old now, and the cost of the Ferris wheel is 100 yen.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of the Ferris wheel for Takahashi based on his age.

First, we need to determine the age group that Takahashi belongs to. We can do this by dividing his age by 5. If the result is 0 or greater than 10, then Takahashi is 10 years old or older. If the result is between 1 and 5, then Takahashi is between 6 and 10 years old. If the result is between 6 and 10, then Takahashi is between 6 and 12 years old. If the result is 11 or greater than 12, then Takahashi is 13 years old or older.

Next, we need to determine the cost of the Ferris wheel based on the age group that Takahashi belongs to. If Takahashi is 10 years old or older, then the cost is 100 yen. If Takahashi is between 6 and 12 years old, then the cost is half the cost of the Ferris wheel, which is 50 yen. If Takahashi is

The symbols Takahashi is going to eat are given to you as a string S. The i-th character in S is the i-th symbol for him to eat.

 - The third integer to eat is +. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes 1.
 - The fourth integer to eat is +. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes 2.
Thus, the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols is 2.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols. The symbols are given to you as a string S. The first character in S is the first symbol for him to eat, and so on.

To solve this problem, you need to keep track of the integer in Takahashi's mind as he eats the symbols. When he eats a +, the integer increases by 1. When he eats a -, the integer decreases by 1.

The first step is to initialize the integer in Takahashi's mind to 0. Then, you need to loop through each character in S and check if it is a + or -. If it is a +, you increase the integer by 1. If it is a -, you decrease the integer by 1.

After looping through all the characters in S, the integer in Takahashi's mind will be the final result. Therefore, you need to print the integer at the end.

We can start by sorting the problems by their topics. We can then group the problems by their topics and find the maximum number of problems in each group.

We can then take the maximum number of problems in each group and multiply it by 2 to get the number of problems in each contest. We can then add up the number of problems in each contest to get the total number of problems in all the contests.

The key is to make sure that each contest has a topic that is different from the previous contest. We can do this by taking the topics in order and grouping them in pairs. We can then take the maximum number of problems in each pair and multiply it by 2 to get the number of problems in each contest.

For example, if we have the topics 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, we can group them in pairs as follows:

1, 2
3, 4
5, 6
7, 8

The only difference between easy and hard versions are constraints on $n$ and $k$.

You are messaging in one of the popular social networks via your smartphone. Your smartphone can show at most $k$ most recent conversations with your friends. Initially, the screen is empty (i.e. the number of displayed conversations equals $0$).

Each conversation is between you and some of your friends. There is at most one conversation with any of your friends. So each conversation is uniquely defined by your friend.

You (suddenly!) have the ability to see the future. You know that during the day you will receive $n$ messages, the $i$-th message will be received from the friend with ID $id_i$ ($1 \le id_i \le 10^9$).

If you receive a message from $id_i$ in the conversation which is currently displayed on the smartphone then nothing happens: the conversations of the screen do not change and do not change their order, you read the message and continue waiting for new messages.

Otherwise (i.e. if there is no conversation with $id_i$ on the screen):  Firstly, if the number of conversations displayed on the screen is $k$, the last conversation (which has the position $k$) is removed from the screen.  Now the number of conversations on the screen is guaranteed to be less than $k$ and the conversation with the friend $id_i$ is not displayed on the screen.  The conversation with the friend $id_i$ appears on the first (the topmost) position on the screen and all the other displayed conversations are shifted one position down. 

Your task is to find the list of conversations (in the order they are displayed on the screen) after processing all $n$ messages.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, k \le 200)$ — the number of messages and the number of conversations your smartphone can show.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $id_1, id_2, \dots, id_n$ ($1 \le id_i \le 10^9$), where $id_i$ is the ID of the friend which sends you the $i$-th message.


-----Output-----

In the first line of the output print one integer $m$ ($1 \le m \le min(n, k)$) — the number of conversations shown after receiving all $n$ messages.

In the second line print $m$ integers $ids_1, ids_2, \dots, ids_m$, where $ids_i$ should be equal to the ID of the friend corresponding to the conversation displayed on the position $i$ after receiving all $n$ messages.


-----Examples-----

Output
2
2 1 

Input
10 4
2 3 3 1 1 2 1 2 3 3

Output
3
1 3 2 



-----Note-----

In the first example the list of conversations will change in the following way (in order from the first to last message):  $[]$;  $[1]$;  $[2, 1]$;  $[3, 2]$;  $[3, 2]$;  $[1, 3]$;  $[1, 3]$;  $[2, 1]$. 

In the second example the list of conversations will change in the following way:  $[]$;  $[2]$;  $[3, 2]$;  $[3, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 2]$;  and then the list will not change till the end.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the list of conversations (in the order they are displayed on the screen) after processing all n messages. The only difference between the easy and hard versions is the constraint on n and k.

The solution is to maintain a list of conversations, where each conversation is represented by a list of friend IDs. The list of conversations is initially empty.

For each message, if the conversation with the friend ID is already displayed on the screen, do nothing. Otherwise, if the number of displayed conversations is less than k, add the conversation to the list. If the number of displayed conversations is equal to k, remove the last conversation from the list and add the new conversation to the beginning of the list.

After processing all n messages, the list of conversations will contain the conversations in the order they are displayed on the screen.

The output is the list of conversations, where each conversation is represented by a list of friend IDs. The list of conversations is guaranteed to be less than or equal to k.

Polycarp has $n$ coins, the value of the $i$-th coin is $a_i$. It is guaranteed that all the values are integer powers of $2$ (i.e. $a_i = 2^d$ for some non-negative integer number $d$).

Polycarp wants to know answers on $q$ queries. The $j$-th query is described as integer number $b_j$. The answer to the query is the minimum number of coins that is necessary to obtain the value $b_j$ using some subset of coins (Polycarp can use only coins he has). If Polycarp can't obtain the value $b_j$, the answer to the $j$-th query is -1.

The queries are independent (the answer on the query doesn't affect Polycarp's coins).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of coins and the number of queries.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ — values of coins ($1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9$). It is guaranteed that all $a_i$ are integer powers of $2$ (i.e. $a_i = 2^d$ for some non-negative integer number $d$).

The next $q$ lines contain one integer each. The $j$-th line contains one integer $b_j$ — the value of the $j$-th query ($1 \le b_j \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print $q$ integers $ans_j$. The $j$-th integer must be equal to the answer on the $j$-th query. If Polycarp can't obtain the value $b_j$ the answer to the $j$-th query is -1.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the minimum number of coins that Polycarp needs to use to get a certain value using a subset of his coins. The values of the coins are guaranteed to be integer powers of 2, so we can use a binary search to find the minimum number of coins needed to get a value.

The idea is to start with the largest coin and try to get the value using that coin. If the value is not possible, then we know that we need to use at least 2 coins to get the value. We can then try to get the value using the next largest coin, and so on.

We can use a binary search to find the minimum number of coins needed to get the value. We start by assuming that we need 1 coin to get the value, and then we try to get the value using 2 coins, 3 coins, and so on. If we can't get the value using a certain number of coins, then we know that we need to use at least that number of coins to get the value.

We can use a loop to iterate through the values of the coins and try to get the value using each coin.

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
There are $n$ players sitting at the card table. Each player has a favorite number. The favorite number of the $j$-th player is $f_j$.

There are $k \cdot n$ cards on the table. Each card contains a single integer: the $i$-th card contains number $c_i$. Also, you are given a sequence $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_k$. Its meaning will be explained below.

The players have to distribute all the cards in such a way that each of them will hold exactly $k$ cards. After all the cards are distributed, each player counts the number of cards he has that contains his favorite number. The joy level of a player equals $h_t$ if the player holds $t$ cards containing his favorite number. If a player gets no cards with his favorite number (i.e., $t=0$), his joy level is $0$.

Print the maximum possible total joy levels of the players after the cards are distributed. Note that the sequence $h_1, \dots, h_k$ is the same for all the players.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 500, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the number of players and the number of cards each player will get.

The second line contains $k \cdot n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_{k \cdot n}$ ($1 \le c_i \le 10^5$) — the numbers written on the cards.

The third line contains $n$ integers $f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n$ ($1 \le f_j \le 10^5$) — the favorite numbers of the players.

The fourth line contains $k$ integers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_k$ ($1 \le h_t \le 10^5$), where $h_t$ is the joy level of a player if he gets exactly $t$ cards with his favorite number written on them. It is guaranteed that the condition $h_{t - 1} < h_t$ holds for each $t \in [2..k]$.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the maximum possible total joy levels of the players among all possible card distributions.

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, one possible optimal card distribution is the following:  Player $1$ gets cards with numbers $[1, 3, 8]$;  Player $2$ gets cards with numbers $[2, 2, 8]$;  Player $3$ gets cards with numbers $[2, 2, 8]$;  Player $4$ gets cards with numbers $[5, 5, 5]$. 

Thus, the answer is $2 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 21$.

In the second example, no player can get a card with his favorite number. Thus, the answer is $0$.

-----Plan-----
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum total joy levels of the players among all possible card distributions where the first i cards are distributed and the j-th player has already received his k cards.

The base case is dp[0][j] = 0, since no cards have been distributed yet and the j-th player has not received any cards.

The recurrence relation is dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1] + h[c[i]]), where c[i] is the number on the i-th card and h[c[i]] is the joy level of the j-th player if he gets exactly c[i] cards with his favorite number written on them.

The answer is dp[k \cdot n][n], where k \cdot n is the total number of cards and n is the number of players.

The time complexity of this solution is O(k \cdot n \cdot n), and the space complexity is O(k

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. You can perform the following operations arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  Choose a pair of indices $(i, j)$ such that $|i-j|=1$ (indices $i$ and $j$ are adjacent) and set $a_i := a_i + |a_i - a_j|$;  Choose a pair of indices $(i, j)$ such that $|i-j|=1$ (indices $i$ and $j$ are adjacent) and set $a_i := a_i - |a_i - a_j|$. 

The value $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$. For example, $|4| = 4$, $|-3| = 3$.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to obtain the array of equal elements and print the order of operations to do it.

It is guaranteed that you always can obtain the array of equal elements using such operations.

Note that after each operation each element of the current array should not exceed $10^{18}$ by absolute value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in $a$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.


-----Output-----

In the first line print one integer $k$ — the minimum number of operations required to obtain the array of equal elements.

In the next $k$ lines print operations itself. The $p$-th operation should be printed as a triple of integers $(t_p, i_p, j_p)$, where $t_p$ is either $1$ or $2$ ($1$ means that you perform the operation of the first type, and $2$ means that you perform the operation of the second type), and $i_p$ and $j_p$ are indices of adjacent elements of the array such that $1 \le i_p, j_p \le n$, $|i_p - j_p| = 1$. See the examples for better understanding.

Note that after each operation each element of the current array should not exceed $10^{18}$ by absolute value.

If there are many possible answers, you can print any.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal. The operations are either adding or subtracting the absolute difference between two adjacent elements.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start with the first element of the array and try to make it equal to all other elements. We do this by adding or subtracting the absolute difference between the first element and the other elements. We continue this process until all elements are equal.

The key insight is that we can always make the first element equal to all other elements by adding or subtracting the absolute difference between the first element and the other elements. This is because the absolute difference between two adjacent elements is always non-negative, so we can always add or subtract it without changing the sign of the elements.

For example, consider the array [2, 4, 6, 6, 6]. We can make all elements equal by adding or subtracting the absolute difference between the first element and the other elements. In this case, we can add 2 to the first element to make it equal to the other elements.

The algorithm works as follows:

Polycarp and his friends want to visit a new restaurant. The restaurant has $n$ tables arranged along a straight line. People are already sitting at some tables. The tables are numbered from $1$ to $n$ in the order from left to right. The state of the restaurant is described by a string of length $n$ which contains characters "1" (the table is occupied) and "0" (the table is empty).

Restaurant rules prohibit people to sit at a distance of $k$ or less from each other. That is, if a person sits at the table number $i$, then all tables with numbers from $i-k$ to $i+k$ (except for the $i$-th) should be free. In other words, the absolute difference of the numbers of any two occupied tables must be strictly greater than $k$.

For example, if $n=8$ and $k=2$, then:  strings "10010001", "10000010", "00000000", "00100000" satisfy the rules of the restaurant;  strings "10100100", "10011001", "11111111" do not satisfy to the rules of the restaurant, since each of them has a pair of "1" with a distance less than or equal to $k=2$. 

In particular, if the state of the restaurant is described by a string without "1" or a string with one "1", then the requirement of the restaurant is satisfied.

You are given a binary string $s$ that describes the current state of the restaurant. It is guaranteed that the rules of the restaurant are satisfied for the string $s$.

Find the maximum number of free tables that you can occupy so as not to violate the rules of the restaurant. Formally, what is the maximum number of "0" that can be replaced by "1" such that the requirement will still be satisfied?

For example, if $n=6$, $k=1$, $s=$ "100010", then the answer to the problem will be $1$, since only the table at position $3$ can be occupied such that the rules are still satisfied.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases in the test. Then $t$ test cases follow.

Each test case starts with a line containing two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$) — the number of tables in the restaurant and the minimum allowed distance between two people.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of "0" and "1" — a description of the free and occupied tables in the restaurant. The given string satisfy to the rules of the restaurant — the difference between indices of any two "1" is more than $k$.

The sum of $n$ for all test cases in one test does not exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case output one integer — the number of tables that you can occupy so as not to violate the rules of the restaurant. If additional tables cannot be taken, then, obviously, you need to output $0$.


-----Example-----
Input

-----Note-----

The first test case is explained in the statement.

In the second test case, the answer is $2$, since you can choose the first and the sixth table.

In the third test case, you cannot take any free table without violating the rules of the restaurant.

-----Plan-----
In this problem, we are given a binary string $s$ that describes the current state of a restaurant. The string contains "0" and "1", where "1" represents an occupied table and "0" represents a free table. The restaurant has $n$ tables arranged along a straight line, and the state of the restaurant is described by a string of length $n$.

The problem is to find the maximum number of free tables that we can occupy so as not to violate the rules of the restaurant. The rules of the restaurant prohibit people from sitting at a distance of $k$ or less from each other. That is, if a person sits at the table number $i$, then all tables with numbers from $i-k$ to $i+k$ (except for the $i$-th) should be free.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can define a function $f(i, j)$ that represents the maximum number of free tables that we can occupy so as not to violate the rules of the restaurant, where $i$ is the current table number and $j$ is the number of free tables that we have already occupied.

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

You are given $n$ segments on the coordinate axis $OX$. Segments can intersect, lie inside each other and even coincide. The $i$-th segment is $[l_i; r_i]$ ($l_i \le r_i$) and it covers all integer points $j$ such that $l_i \le j \le r_i$.

The integer point is called bad if it is covered by strictly more than $k$ segments.

Your task is to remove the minimum number of segments so that there are no bad points at all.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of segments and the maximum number of segments by which each integer point can be covered.

The next $n$ lines contain segments. The $i$-th line contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the endpoints of the $i$-th segment.


-----Output-----

In the first line print one integer $m$ ($0 \le m \le n$) — the minimum number of segments you need to remove so that there are no bad points.

-----Plan-----
This problem can be solved using a technique called "segment intersection" or "segment overlap". The basic idea is to find all the pairs of segments that overlap, and then remove the segments that overlap.

To find the pairs of segments that overlap, we can use a simple algorithm that checks each segment against every other segment. If two segments overlap, we remove the segment that ends earlier. If two segments have the same endpoints, we remove the segment that appears earlier in the input.

Once we have found all the pairs of segments that overlap, we can remove the segments that overlap. We can do this by keeping track of the segments that we have already removed, and only removing a segment if it has not been removed yet.

The key insight is that we can use a data structure called a "disjoint set" to keep track of which segments overlap. A disjoint set is a data structure that allows us to efficiently find the connected components of a graph. In this case, we can use a disjoint set to find the connected components of the graph of segments, where two segments are connected if they overlap.

By using a disjoint set, we can efficiently find the pairs of segments that overlap, and then remove the segments

One important contest will take place on the most famous programming platform (Topforces) very soon!

The authors have a pool of $n$ problems and should choose at most three of them into this contest. The prettiness of the $i$-th problem is $a_i$. The authors have to compose the most pretty contest (in other words, the cumulative prettinesses of chosen problems should be maximum possible).

But there is one important thing in the contest preparation: because of some superstitions of authors, the prettinesses of problems cannot divide each other. In other words, if the prettinesses of chosen problems are $x, y, z$, then $x$ should be divisible by neither $y$, nor $z$, $y$ should be divisible by neither $x$, nor $z$ and $z$ should be divisible by neither $x$, nor $y$. If the prettinesses of chosen problems are $x$ and $y$ then neither $x$ should be divisible by $y$ nor $y$ should be divisible by $x$. Any contest composed from one problem is considered good.

Your task is to find out the maximum possible total prettiness of the contest composed of at most three problems from the given pool.

You have to answer $q$ independent queries.

If you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.

The first line of the query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of problems.

In this problem, we are given a pool of $n$ problems, and we have to choose at most three problems to form a contest. The prettiness of each problem is given as $a_i$. The task is to find the maximum possible cumulative prettiness of the contest composed of at most three problems.

The problem statement also mentions that the prettinesses of chosen problems cannot divide each other. This means that if we choose three problems, the prettinesses of the first two problems should not be divisible by the third problem, and the prettinesses of the first and third problems should not be divisible by the second problem, and the prettinesses of the second and third problems should not be divisible by the first problem.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by choosing the problem with the highest prettiness, and then we can choose the next two problems in such a way that the prettinesses of the first two problems are not divisible by the third problem. We can continue this process until we have chosen at most three problems.

There is only one restriction here: the $1$-st and the $3$-th students can't be in the same team (because of $|a_1 - a_3|=|2-1|=1$). It is possible to divide them into $2$ teams: for example, students $1$, $2$ and $4$ are in the first team and the student $3$ in the second team.

In the second query of the example, there are $n=2$ students with the skills $a=[3, 6]$. It is possible to compose just a single team containing both students.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of teams that can be formed such that no two students with a difference of 1 in their programming skills are in the same team.

We can start by sorting the programming skills in increasing order, which will give us the following sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 20, 100.

Now, we can start forming teams. We can start with the first student, who has a programming skill of 1. We can form a team with this student and the next student, who has a programming skill of 2. We can continue this process until we reach the last student, who has a programming skill of 100.

However, we need to make sure that no two students with a difference of 1 in their programming skills are in the same team. This means that we need to make sure that the difference between the programming skills of any two students in the same team is strictly greater than 1.

For example, if we form a team with students 1 and 2, and then form a team with students 3 and 4, we

You have $a$ coins of value $n$ and $b$ coins of value $1$. You always pay in exact change, so you want to know if there exist such $x$ and $y$ that if you take $x$ ($0 \le x \le a$) coins of value $n$ and $y$ ($0 \le y \le b$) coins of value $1$, then the total value of taken coins will be $S$.

You have to answer $q$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $q$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains four integers $a$, $b$, $n$ and $S$ ($1 \le a, b, n, S \le 10^9$) — the number of coins of value $n$, the number of coins of value $1$, the value $n$ and the required total value.


-----Output-----

For the $i$-th test case print the answer on it — YES (without quotes) if there exist such $x$ and $y$ that if you take $x$ coins of value $n$ and $y$ coins of value $1$, then the total value of taken coins will be $S$, and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

In this problem, we are given $a$ coins of value $n$ and $b$ coins of value $1$. We want to know if there exist such $x$ and $y$ that if we take $x$ coins of value $n$ and $y$ coins of value $1$, then the total value of taken coins will be $S$.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by considering the cases where $x = 0$ or $y = 0$. If $x = 0$, then we can take any number of coins of value $1$ and the total value will be $S$. If $y = 0$, then we can take any number of coins of value $n$ and the total value will be $S$.

Now, let's consider the case where $x > 0$ and $y > 0$. In this case, we can take $x$ coins of value $n$ and $y$ coins of value $1$. The total value of taken coins will be $S$ if and only if $xn + y = S$.

Two integer sequences existed initially — one of them was strictly increasing, and the other one — strictly decreasing.

Strictly increasing sequence is a sequence of integers $[x_1 < x_2 < \dots < x_k]$. And strictly decreasing sequence is a sequence of integers $[y_1 > y_2 > \dots > y_l]$. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.

They were merged into one sequence $a$. After that sequence $a$ got shuffled. For example, some of the possible resulting sequences $a$ for an increasing sequence $[1, 3, 4]$ and a decreasing sequence $[10, 4, 2]$ are sequences $[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 10]$ or $[4, 2, 1, 10, 4, 3]$.

This shuffled sequence $a$ is given in the input.

Your task is to find any two suitable initial sequences. One of them should be strictly increasing and the other one — strictly decreasing. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.

If there is a contradiction in the input and it is impossible to split the given sequence $a$ to increasing and decreasing sequences, print "NO".


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in $a$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.


-----Output-----

If there is a contradiction in the input and it is impossible to split the given sequence $a$ to increasing and decreasing sequences, print "NO" in the first line.

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line and any two suitable sequences. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.

In the second line print $n_i$ — the number of elements in the strictly increasing sequence. $n_i$ can be zero, in this case the increasing sequence is empty.

In the third line print $n_i$ integers $inc_1, inc_2, \dots, inc_{n_i}$ in the increasing order of its values ($inc_1 < inc_2 < \dots < inc_{n_i}$) — the strictly increasing sequence itself. You can keep this line empty if $n_i = 0$ (or just print the empty line).

In the fourth line print $n_d$ — the number of elements in the strictly decreasing sequence. $n_d$ can be zero, in this case the decreasing sequence is empty.

In the fifth line print $n_d$ integers $dec_1, dec_2, \dots, dec_{n_d}$ in the decreasing order of its values ($dec_1 > dec_2 > \dots > dec_{n_d}$) — the strictly decreasing sequence itself. You can keep this line empty if $n_d = 0$ (or just print the empty line).

$n_i + n_d$ should be equal to $n$ and the union of printed sequences should be a permutation of the given sequence (in case of "YES" answer).

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find two sequences of integers, one strictly increasing and the other strictly decreasing, that can be formed from a given shuffled sequence. The input consists of a sequence of integers, and the output consists of two sequences of integers, one strictly increasing and the other strictly decreasing.

The solution is to first find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS) of the given sequence. The LIS and LDS are the longest sequences of integers in the given sequence such that all elements in the sequence are either in the LIS or the LDS.

Once the LIS and LDS are found, we can form the two sequences of integers by concatenating the elements of the LIS and LDS. The first sequence will be the LIS, and the second sequence will be the LDS.

For example, if the given sequence is [7, 2, 7, 3, 3, 1, 4], the LIS is [7, 2, 7, 3, 3], and the LDS is [1, 4]. The two sequences of integers that can be formed from the given sequence are

Easy and hard versions are actually different problems, so read statements of both problems completely and carefully.

Summer vacation has started so Alice and Bob want to play and joy, but... Their mom doesn't think so. She says that they have to read some amount of books before all entertainments. Alice and Bob will read each book together to end this exercise faster.

There are $n$ books in the family library. The $i$-th book is described by three integers: $t_i$ — the amount of time Alice and Bob need to spend to read it, $a_i$ (equals $1$ if Alice likes the $i$-th book and $0$ if not), and $b_i$ (equals $1$ if Bob likes the $i$-th book and $0$ if not).

So they need to choose some books from the given $n$ books in such a way that:

  Alice likes at least $k$ books from the chosen set and Bob likes at least $k$ books from the chosen set;  the total reading time of these books is minimized (they are children and want to play and joy as soon a possible). 

The set they choose is the same for both Alice an Bob (it's shared between them) and they read all books together, so the total reading time is the sum of $t_i$ over all books that are in the chosen set.

Your task is to help them and find any suitable set of books or determine that it is impossible to find such a set.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).

The next $n$ lines contain descriptions of books, one description per line: the $i$-th line contains three integers $t_i$, $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^4$, $0 \le a_i, b_i \le 1$), where:

  $t_i$ — the amount of time required for reading the $i$-th book;  $a_i$ equals $1$ if Alice likes the $i$-th book and $0$ otherwise;  $b_i$ equals $1$ if Bob likes the $i$-th book and $0$ otherwise. 


-----Output-----

If there is no solution, print only one integer -1. Otherwise print one integer $T$ — the minimum total reading time of the suitable set of books.

The problem is to find the minimum total reading time of a set of books such that Alice and Bob like at least $k$ books from the set and the total reading time is minimized.

The easy version of the problem is to find a set of books such that Alice and Bob like at least $k$ books from the set. This can be done by finding the $k$ books that Alice and Bob like and reading them together. The total reading time of these books is the sum of the time required to read each book.

The hard version of the problem is to find a set of books such that Alice and Bob like at least $k$ books from the set and the total reading time is minimized. This can be done by finding the $k$ books that Alice and Bob like and reading them together. The total reading time of these books is the sum of the time required to read each book.

The solution is to find the $k$ books that Alice and Bob like and read them together. The total reading time of these books is the sum of the time required to read each book. If there are less than $k$ books that Alice and Bob like, then it is not possible to find a set of

There are $n$ products in the shop. The price of the $i$-th product is $a_i$. The owner of the shop wants to equalize the prices of all products. However, he wants to change prices smoothly.

In fact, the owner of the shop can change the price of some product $i$ in such a way that the difference between the old price of this product $a_i$ and the new price $b_i$ is at most $k$. In other words, the condition $|a_i - b_i| \le k$ should be satisfied ($|x|$ is the absolute value of $x$).

He can change the price for each product not more than once. Note that he can leave the old prices for some products. The new price $b_i$ of each product $i$ should be positive (i.e. $b_i > 0$ should be satisfied for all $i$ from $1$ to $n$).

Your task is to find out the maximum possible equal price $B$ of all productts with the restriction that for all products the condiion $|a_i - B| \le k$ should be satisfied (where $a_i$ is the old price of the product and $B$ is the same new price of all products) or report that it is impossible to find such price $B$.

Note that the chosen price $B$ should be integer.

You should answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 100$) — the number of queries. Each query is presented by two lines.

The first line of the query contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 100, 1 \le k \le 10^8$) — the number of products and the value $k$. The second line of the query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^8$), where $a_i$ is the price of the $i$-th product.


-----Output-----

Print $q$ integers, where the $i$-th integer is the answer $B$ on the $i$-th query.

If it is impossible to equalize prices of all given products with restriction that for all products the condition $|a_i - B| \le k$ should be satisfied (where $a_i$ is the old price of the product and $B$ is the new equal price of all products), print -1. Otherwise print the maximum possible equal price of all products.

-----Note-----

In the first example query you can choose the price $B=2$. It is easy to see that the difference between each old price and each new price $B=2$ is no more than $1$.

In the second example query you can choose the price $B=6$ and then all the differences between old and new price $B=6$ will be no more than $2$.

In the third example query you cannot choose any suitable price $B$. For any value $B$ at least one condition out of two will be violated: $|1-B| \le 2$, $|6-B| \le 2$.

In the fourth example query all values $B$ between $1$ and $7$ are valid. But the maximum is $7$, so it's the answer.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of $B$ such that for all products, the condition $|a_i - B| \le k$ is satisfied.

We can start by considering the case where all products have the same price $a$. In this case, the maximum value of $B$ is $a + k$, since the difference between the old price and the new price is at most $k$.

Now, let's consider the case where the prices of the products are not all the same. We can sort the prices in non-decreasing order, and let $a_1$ be the smallest price and $a_n$ be the largest price.

We can start by considering the case where $a_1 = a_n$. In this case, the maximum value of $B$ is $a_1 + k$, since the difference between the old price and the new price is at most $k$.

Now, let's consider the case where $a_1 \neq a_n$. We can divide the products into two groups: the products with price $a_1$ and the products with price $a_n$. We can solve

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. Each $a_i$ is one of the six following numbers: $4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42$.

Your task is to remove the minimum number of elements to make this array good.

An array of length $k$ is called good if $k$ is divisible by $6$ and it is possible to split it into $\frac{k}{6}$ subsequences $4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42$.

Examples of good arrays:  $[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]$ (the whole array is a required sequence);  $[4, 8, 4, 15, 16, 8, 23, 15, 16, 42, 23, 42]$ (the first sequence is formed from first, second, fourth, fifth, seventh and tenth elements and the second one is formed from remaining elements);  $[]$ (the empty array is good). 

Examples of bad arrays:   $[4, 8, 15, 16, 42, 23]$ (the order of elements should be exactly $4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42$);  $[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 4]$ (the length of the array is not divisible by $6$);  $[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 23]$ (the first sequence can be formed from first six elements but the remaining array cannot form the required sequence). 


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in $a$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ (each $a_i$ is one of the following numbers: $4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it good.

A good array is one that can be split into six equal-sized subsequences of the required numbers: $4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42$.

To check if an array is good, we can count the number of elements in each subsequence and see if they are all present. If the number of elements in each subsequence is not equal, then the array is not good.

To find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed, we can start by removing any elements that are not required. We can remove any element that is not one of $4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42$.

Once we have removed any unnecessary elements, we can check if the remaining elements form a good array. If they do, then we can stop. If they do not, then we can remove any additional elements that are not required.

We can continue this process until we have removed all the unnecessary elements and the remaining array is good. The minimum number of

You are given two integers $a$ and $b$.

In one move, you can choose some integer $k$ from $1$ to $10$ and add it to $a$ or subtract it from $a$. In other words, you choose an integer $k \in [1; 10]$ and perform $a := a + k$ or $a := a - k$. You may use different values of $k$ in different moves.

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain $b$ from $a$.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).

-----Note-----

In the first test case of the example, you don't need to do anything.

In the second test case of the example, the following sequence of moves can be applied: $13 \rightarrow 23 \rightarrow 32 \rightarrow 42$ (add $10$, add $9$, add $10$).

In the third test case of the example, the following sequence of moves can be applied: $18 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 4$ (subtract $8$, subtract $6$).

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain the value $b$ from the initial value $a$. We can do this by keeping track of the current value of $a$ and the number of moves made so far.

We can start by initializing $a$ to the initial value $a$ and $moves$ to 0. We then loop through each move, where we choose an integer $k$ from $1$ to $10$ and either add $k$ to $a$ or subtract $k$ from $a$. We update $moves$ accordingly.

We continue this loop until we reach the value $b$. Once we reach $b$, we return the number of moves made so far.

The time complexity of this solution is $O(10^5 \cdot 10^9)$, which is optimal since we need to consider all possible values of $k$ for each move. The space complexity is $O(1)$, since we only need to keep track of the current value of $a$ and the number of moves made so far.

You are given three integers $x, y$ and $n$. Your task is to find the maximum integer $k$ such that $0 \le k \le n$ that $k \bmod x = y$, where $\bmod$ is modulo operation. Many programming languages use percent operator % to implement it.

In other words, with given $x, y$ and $n$ you need to find the maximum possible integer from $0$ to $n$ that has the remainder $y$ modulo $x$.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. It is guaranteed that such $k$ exists for each test case.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The next $t$ lines contain test cases.

The only line of the test case contains three integers $x, y$ and $n$ ($2 \le x \le 10^9;~ 0 \le y < x;~ y \le n \le 10^9$).

It can be shown that such $k$ always exists under the given constraints.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer — maximum non-negative integer $k$ such that $0 \le k \le n$ and $k \bmod x = y$. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.

-----Note-----

In the first test case of the example, the answer is $12339 = 7 \cdot 1762 + 5$ (thus, $12339 \bmod 7 = 5$). It is obvious that there is no greater integer not exceeding $12345$ which has the remainder $5$ modulo $7$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum integer $k$ such that $0 \leq k \leq n$ and $k \bmod x = y$. We can do this by using the modulo operation, which gives us the remainder of dividing $k$ by $x$.

We know that $0 \leq k \leq n$, so we can start by finding the maximum integer $k$ such that $0 \leq k \leq n$ and $k \bmod x = y$. We can do this by using the modulo operation, which gives us the remainder of dividing $k$ by $x$.

For example, if $x = 7$ and $y = 5$, we can find the maximum integer $k$ such that $0 \leq k \leq n$ and $k \bmod x = y$ by finding the maximum integer $k$ such that $0 \leq k \leq n$ and $k \bmod 7 = 5$.

We can do this by using the modulo operation, which gives us the remainder of dividing $k$ by $7$. We know that $0 \leq k \leq n$,

International Women's Day is coming soon! Polycarp is preparing for the holiday.

There are $n$ candy boxes in the shop for sale. The $i$-th box contains $d_i$ candies.

Polycarp wants to prepare the maximum number of gifts for $k$ girls. Each gift will consist of exactly two boxes. The girls should be able to share each gift equally, so the total amount of candies in a gift (in a pair of boxes) should be divisible by $k$. In other words, two boxes $i$ and $j$ ($i \ne j$) can be combined as a gift if $d_i + d_j$ is divisible by $k$.

How many boxes will Polycarp be able to give? Of course, each box can be a part of no more than one gift. Polycarp cannot use boxes "partially" or redistribute candies between them.

So the answer is $6$.

In the second example Polycarp can give the following pairs of boxes (pairs are presented by indices of corresponding boxes):   $(6, 8)$;  $(2, 3)$;  $(1, 4)$;  $(5, 7)$. 

So the answer is $8$.

In the third example Polycarp can give the following pairs of boxes (pairs are presented by indices of corresponding boxes):   $(1, 2)$;  $(6, 7)$. 

So the answer is $4$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of boxes that Polycarp can give as gifts. We can do this by finding the maximum number of pairs of boxes that can be formed, such that the total number of candies in each pair is divisible by $k$.

Let's consider the following steps:

1. Find the number of pairs of boxes that can be formed by selecting two boxes from the $n$ boxes.
2. For each pair of boxes, check if the total number of candies in the pair is divisible by $k$.
3. If the total number of candies in the pair is divisible by $k$, then we can form a gift with that pair.
4. Find the maximum number of pairs of boxes that can be formed in step 2.

The maximum number of pairs of boxes that can be formed is $n \choose 2$, which is equal to $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.

Now, let's consider the second step. For each pair of boxes, we need to check if the total number of candies in the pair is divisible by $k$. If the total number of candies

You are given a string S of length N consisting of A, B and C, and an integer K which is between 1 and N (inclusive).
Print the string S after lowercasing the K-th character in it.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 50
 - 1 ≤ K ≤ N
 - S is a string of length N consisting of A, B and C.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
S

-----Output-----
Print the string S after lowercasing the K-th character in it.

-----Sample Input-----
3 1
ABC

-----Sample Output-----
aBC


-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to take a string S of length N consisting of A, B, and C, and lowercase the K-th character in it. The K-th character is the character that appears at index K-1 in the string.

To solve this problem, you can use a for loop to iterate through the characters of the string S, and a variable to keep track of the index of the current character. When the index is equal to K-1, you can replace the current character with its lowercase version.

Here is an example of how you might solve this problem:
```
string s = "ABC";
int k = 1;

for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
    if (i == k - 1) {
        s[i] = tolower(s[i]);
    }
}

cout << s << endl;
```
This code will output "aBC".

Note that the `tolower()` function is used to convert the character to its lowercase version.

You have decided to write a book introducing good restaurants.
There are N restaurants that you want to introduce: Restaurant 1, Restaurant 2, ..., Restaurant N. Restaurant i is in city S_i, and your assessment score of that restaurant on a 100-point scale is P_i.
No two restaurants have the same score.
You want to introduce the restaurants in the following order:
 - The restaurants are arranged in lexicographical order of the names of their cities.
 - If there are multiple restaurants in the same city, they are arranged in descending order of score.
Print the identification numbers of the restaurants in the order they are introduced in the book.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
 - S is a string of length between 1 and 10 (inclusive) consisting of lowercase English letters.
 - 0 ≤ P_i ≤ 100
 - P_i is an integer.
 - P_i ≠ P_j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ N)

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S_1 P_1
:
S_N P_N

-----Output-----
Print N lines. The i-th line (1 ≤ i ≤ N) should contain the identification number of the restaurant that is introduced i-th in the book.

moscow 10
kazan 50
kazan 35
moscow 60
khabarovsk 40

-----Sample Output-----
3
4
6
1
5
2

The lexicographical order of the names of the three cities is kazan < khabarovsk < moscow. For each of these cities, the restaurants in it are introduced in descending order of score. Thus, the restaurants are introduced in the order 3,4,6,1,5,2.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to first sort the restaurants by their city names in lexicographical order. We can do this by creating a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the city name and the restaurant's score. We can then sort this list by the city names in lexicographical order.

Once the list is sorted, we can then sort the restaurants within each city by their scores in descending order. We can do this by creating a new list of tuples, where each tuple contains the city name and the restaurant's score. We can then sort this list by the scores in descending order.

Finally, we can print the identification numbers of the restaurants in the order they are introduced in the book. We can do this by iterating through the sorted list of tuples and printing the identification number of each restaurant.

Here is the code in Python:
```
# Read the input
n = int(input())
restaurants = []
for i in range(n):
    city, score = input().split()
    restaurants.append((city, int(score)))

Takahashi has K 500-yen coins. (Yen is the currency of Japan.)
If these coins add up to X yen or more, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
K X

-----Output-----
If the coins add up to X yen or more, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
2 900

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

Two 500-yen coins add up to 1000 yen, which is not less than X = 900 yen.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to determine if the sum of 500-yen coins is greater than or equal to a certain amount, X. We are given the number of coins, K, and the amount, X.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by adding up the values of the coins and storing the result in a variable, say, sum. We can then compare the value of sum to X. If sum is greater than or equal to X, we print "Yes" as the answer. Otherwise, we print "No" as the answer.

Here's the pseudocode for the solution:

1. Read the values of K and X from the input.
2. Initialize the sum variable to 0.
3. Loop K times:
	* Add 500 to the sum variable.
4. If the sum variable is greater than or equal to X, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".

Note that this solution assumes that the coins are of the same denomination (500 yen in this case). If the coins are of different denominations, we would need to adjust the algorithm

Snuke has a fair N-sided die that shows the integers from 1 to N with equal probability and a fair coin. He will play the following game with them:
 - Throw the die. The current score is the result of the die.
 - As long as the score is between 1 and K-1 (inclusive), keep flipping the coin. The score is doubled each time the coin lands heads up, and the score becomes 0 if the coin lands tails up.
 - The game ends when the score becomes 0 or becomes K or above. Snuke wins if the score is K or above, and loses if the score is 0.
You are given N and K. Find the probability that Snuke wins the game.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
 - 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K

-----Output-----
Print the probability that Snuke wins the game. The output is considered correct when the absolute or relative error is at most 10^{-9}.

-----Sample Input-----
3 10

-----Sample Output-----
0.145833333333

 - If the die shows 1, Snuke needs to get four consecutive heads from four coin flips to obtain a score of 10 or above. The probability of this happening is \frac{1}{3} \times (\frac{1}{2})^4 = \frac{1}{48}.
 - If the die shows 2, Snuke needs to get three consecutive heads from three coin flips to obtain a score of 10 or above. The probability of this happening is \frac{1}{3} \times (\frac{1}{2})^3 = \frac{1}{24}.
 - If the die shows 3, Snuke needs to get two consecutive heads from two coin flips to obtain a score of 10 or above. The probability of this happening is \frac{1}{3} \times (\frac{1}{2})^2 = \frac{1}{12}.
Thus, the probability that Snuke wins is \frac{1}{48} + \frac{1}{24} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{7}{48} \simeq 0.1458333333.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Snuke wins the game.

Let's first consider the case where the die shows 1. In this case, Snuke needs to get four consecutive heads from four coin flips to obtain a score of 10 or above. The probability of this happening is (1/3) x (1/2)^4 = 1/48.

Now, let's consider the case where the die shows 2. In this case, Snuke needs to get three consecutive heads from three coin flips to obtain a score of 10 or above. The probability of this happening is (1/3) x (1/2)^3 = 1/24.

Finally, let's consider the case where the die shows 3. In this case, Snuke needs to get two consecutive heads from two coin flips to obtain a score of 10 or above. The probability of this happening is (1/3) x (1/2)^2 = 1/12.

Now, let's calculate the probability that Snuke wins the game. We can

-----Output-----

-----Sample Input-----
SAT

-----Sample Output-----

It is Saturday today, and tomorrow will be Sunday.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days until the next Sunday. We can do this by counting the number of days until the next Sunday from the current day.

First, we need to determine the current day of the week. We can do this by checking the first letter of the input string, which will be either "S" for Sunday, "M" for Monday, "T" for Tuesday, and so on.

Once we know the current day of the week, we can count the number of days until the next Sunday. We can do this by subtracting the current day of the week from 7 (the number of days in a week). If the result is positive, it means that the next Sunday is in the future, and we can print the result. If the result is negative, it means that the next Sunday has already passed, and we can print 0.

Here is an example of how this solution would work:

Input: SAT

Current day of the week: SAT

Days until the next Sunday: 7 - 6 = 1

Output: 1

You are given r, D and x_{2000}. Calculate x_{2001}, ..., x_{2010} and print them in order.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the values of x_i for i = 2001 to 2010. We are given the formula for x_i, which is x_i = rx_{i-1} - D. We are also given the initial value of x_2000.

We can start by finding the values of x_i for i = 2001 to 2009. We can do this by using the formula repeatedly. For example, to find x_2001, we can use the formula as follows:

x_2001 = rx_{2000} - D = 2 \times 20 - 10 = 30

To find x_2002, we can use the formula as follows:

x_2002 = rx_2001 - D = 2 \times 30 - 10 = 50

Similarly, we can find the values of x_i for i = 2003 to 2010 as follows:

You are given an array $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$ consisting of $n$ integer numbers.

Your task is to split this array into three parts (some of which may be empty) in such a way that each element of the array belongs to exactly one of the three parts, and each of the parts forms a consecutive contiguous subsegment (possibly, empty) of the original array. 

Let the sum of elements of the first part be $sum_1$, the sum of elements of the second part be $sum_2$ and the sum of elements of the third part be $sum_3$. Among all possible ways to split the array you have to choose a way such that $sum_1 = sum_3$ and $sum_1$ is maximum possible.

More formally, if the first part of the array contains $a$ elements, the second part of the array contains $b$ elements and the third part contains $c$ elements, then:

$$sum_1 = \sum\limits_{1 \le i \le a}d_i,$$ $$sum_2 = \sum\limits_{a + 1 \le i \le a + b}d_i,$$ $$sum_3 = \sum\limits_{a + b + 1 \le i \le a + b + c}d_i.$$

The sum of an empty array is $0$.

Your task is to find a way to split the array such that $sum_1 = sum_3$ and $sum_1$ is maximum possible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in the array $d$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$ ($1 \le d_i \le 10^9$) — the elements of the array $d$.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum possible value of $sum_1$, considering that the condition $sum_1 = sum_3$ must be met.

Obviously, at least one valid way to split the array exists (use $a=c=0$ and $b=n$).

-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one possible splitting which maximizes $sum_1$: $[1, 3, 1], [~], [1, 4]$.

In the second example the only way to have $sum_1=4$ is: $[1, 3], [2, 1], [4]$.

In the third example there is only one way to split the array: $[~], [4, 1, 2], [~]$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum value of $sum_1$ such that $sum_1 = sum_3$ and $sum_1$ is the maximum possible value.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let $dp[i][j][k]$ be the maximum value of $sum_1$ such that $sum_1 = sum_3$ and $sum_1$ is the maximum possible value, where $i$ is the number of elements in the first part, $j$ is the number of elements in the second part, and $k$ is the number of elements in the third part.

We can initialize $dp[0][0][0] = 0$, since there is no way to split the array into three parts such that $sum_1 = sum_3$ and $sum_1$ is the maximum possible value.

For each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, we can calculate $dp[i][j][k]$ for each $j$ and $k$ from $0$ to $n-i$. We can calculate $dp[i][j][k]$ as follows:

Maksim has $n$ objects and $m$ boxes, each box has size exactly $k$. Objects are numbered from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right, the size of the $i$-th object is $a_i$.

Maksim wants to pack his objects into the boxes and he will pack objects by the following algorithm: he takes one of the empty boxes he has, goes from left to right through the objects, and if the $i$-th object fits in the current box (the remaining size of the box is greater than or equal to $a_i$), he puts it in the box, and the remaining size of the box decreases by $a_i$. Otherwise he takes the new empty box and continues the process above. If he has no empty boxes and there is at least one object not in some box then Maksim cannot pack the chosen set of objects.

Maksim wants to know the maximum number of objects he can pack by the algorithm above. To reach this target, he will throw out the leftmost object from the set until the remaining set of objects can be packed in boxes he has. Your task is to say the maximum number of objects Maksim can pack in boxes he has.

Each time when Maksim tries to pack the objects into the boxes, he will make empty all the boxes he has before do it (and the relative order of the remaining set of objects will not change).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \le k \le 10^9$) — the number of objects, the number of boxes and the size of each box.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le k$), where $a_i$ is the size of the $i$-th object.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum number of objects Maksim can pack using the algorithm described in the problem statement.

Output
4

Input
5 1 4
4 2 3 4 1

Output

Input
5 3 3
1 2 3 1 1

Output
5



-----Note-----

In the first example Maksim can pack only $4$ objects. Firstly, he tries to pack all the $5$ objects. Distribution of objects will be $[5], [2, 1]$. Maxim cannot pack the next object in the second box and he has no more empty boxes at all. Next he will throw out the first object and the objects distribution will be $[2, 1], [4, 2]$. So the answer is $4$.

In the second example it is obvious that Maksim cannot pack all the objects starting from first, second, third and fourth (in all these cases the distribution of objects is $[4]$), but he can pack the last object ($[1]$).

In the third example Maksim can pack all the objects he has. The distribution will be $[1, 2], [3], [1, 1]$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum number of objects that can be packed into boxes of size $k$ using the algorithm described in the problem statement. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Start with all the boxes empty.
2. Go from left to right through the objects and try to pack each object into the current box. If the object fits in the box, remove it from the list of objects and decrease the size of the box by the size of the object.
3. If there are no more empty boxes and there is at least one object not in any box, then the algorithm cannot pack the chosen set of objects.
4. If there are no more objects to pack, then the algorithm has packed all the objects.

The key insight is that the algorithm will always pack the objects in the order in which they are given, and it will always pack the objects in the boxes in the order in which they are given. Therefore, the maximum number of objects that can be packed is the number of objects that can be packed in the first box, which is $k$.

Therefore, the maximum number of objects that can be packed is $k$.

Recently, Norge found a string $s = s_1 s_2 \ldots s_n$ consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters. As an exercise to improve his typing speed, he decided to type all substrings of the string $s$. Yes, all $\frac{n (n + 1)}{2}$ of them!

A substring of $s$ is a non-empty string $x = s[a \ldots b] = s_{a} s_{a + 1} \ldots s_{b}$ ($1 \leq a \leq b \leq n$). For example, "auto" and "ton" are substrings of "automaton".

Shortly after the start of the exercise, Norge realized that his keyboard was broken, namely, he could use only $k$ Latin letters $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k$ out of $26$.

After that, Norge became interested in how many substrings of the string $s$ he could still type using his broken keyboard. Help him to find this number.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq k \leq 26$) — the length of the string $s$ and the number of Latin letters still available on the keyboard.

The second line contains the string $s$ consisting of exactly $n$ lowercase Latin letters.

The third line contains $k$ space-separated distinct lowercase Latin letters $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k$ — the letters still available on the keyboard.


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the number of substrings of $s$ that can be typed using only available letters $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k$.

In the first example Norge can print substrings $s[1\ldots2]$, $s[2\ldots3]$, $s[1\ldots3]$, $s[1\ldots1]$, $s[2\ldots2]$, $s[3\ldots3]$, $s[5\ldots6]$, $s[6\ldots7]$, $s[5\ldots7]$, $s[5\ldots5]$, $s[6\ldots6]$, $s[7\ldots7]$.

The problem is asking for the number of substrings of a given string that can be formed using a subset of the letters in the string. The solution is to find the number of substrings that can be formed using only the letters that are available on the broken keyboard.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of substrings that can be formed using only the letters that are available on the broken keyboard. We can do this by counting the number of substrings that can be formed using each letter in the broken keyboard.

Let's consider the string "abacaba" and the broken keyboard that has only the letters "a" and "b" available. We can form the following substrings using only these letters:

* "a"
* "ab"
* "aca"
* "acab"
* "acaba"

There are 5 substrings that can be formed using only the letters "a" and "b" available on the broken keyboard.

Now, let's consider the string "sadfaasdda" and the broken keyboard that has only the letters "f", "a", and "d" available. We can form the following substrings

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
Recall that the sequence $b$ is a a subsequence of the sequence $a$ if $b$ can be derived from $a$ by removing zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, if $a=[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]$, then possible subsequences are: $[1, 1, 1, 1]$, $[3]$ and $[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]$, but not $[3, 2, 3]$ and $[1, 1, 1, 1, 2]$.

You are given a sequence $a$ consisting of $n$ positive and negative elements (there is no zeros in the sequence).

Your task is to choose maximum by size (length) alternating subsequence of the given sequence (i.e. the sign of each next element is the opposite from the sign of the current element, like positive-negative-positive and so on or negative-positive-negative and so on). Among all such subsequences, you have to choose one which has the maximum sum of elements.

In other words, if the maximum length of alternating subsequence is $k$ then your task is to find the maximum sum of elements of some alternating subsequence of length $k$.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in $a$. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9, a_i \ne 0$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$ ($\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer — the maximum sum of the maximum by size (length) alternating subsequence of $a$.

In the second test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $[-1, -2, \underline{-1}, -3]$.

In the third test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $[\underline{-2}, 8, 3, \underline{8}, \underline{-4}, -15, \underline{5}, \underline{-2}, -3, \underline{1}]$.

In the fourth test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $[\underline{1}, \underline{-1000000000}, \underline{1}, \underline{-1000000000}, \underline{1}, \underline{-1000000000}]$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum by size (length) alternating subsequence of the given sequence $a$. We can do this by first finding all possible alternating subsequences of length $k$ for some $k \in [1, n]$, where $n$ is the length of the input sequence $a$. We can then find the maximum sum of elements of each of these subsequence by summing up the elements of each subsequence. Finally, we can choose the subsequence with the maximum sum as the answer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Find all possible alternating subsequence of length $k$ for some $k \in [1, n]$.
2. For each subsequence, find the sum of its elements.
3. Choose the subsequence with the maximum sum as the answer.

To find all possible alternating subsequence of length $k$, we can use the following approach:

1. Start with the first element of the input sequence $a$.
2. If the current element is positive, add it to the subsequence and move to the next element.
3. If the current

You are given an undirected unweighted connected graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple edges in the given graph.

Your task is to find any spanning tree of this graph such that the maximum degree over all vertices is maximum possible. Recall that the degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $n - 1 \le m \le min(2 \cdot 10^5, \frac{n(n-1)}{2})$) — the number of vertices and edges, respectively.

The following $m$ lines denote edges: edge $i$ is represented by a pair of integers $v_i$, $u_i$ ($1 \le v_i, u_i \le n$, $u_i \ne v_i$), which are the indices of vertices connected by the edge. There are no loops or multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair ($v_i, u_i$) there are no other pairs ($v_i, u_i$) or ($u_i, v_i$) in the list of edges, and for each pair $(v_i, u_i)$ the condition $v_i \ne u_i$ is satisfied.


-----Output-----

Print $n-1$ lines describing the edges of a spanning tree such that the maximum degree over all vertices is maximum possible. Make sure that the edges of the printed spanning tree form some subset of the input edges (order doesn't matter and edge $(v, u)$ is considered the same as the edge $(u, v)$).

If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

Picture corresponding to the first example: [Image]

In this example the number of edges of spanning tree incident to the vertex $3$ is $3$. It is the maximum degree over all vertices of the spanning tree. It is easy to see that we cannot obtain a better answer.

Picture corresponding to the second example: [Image]

In this example the number of edges of spanning tree incident to the vertex $1$ is $3$. It is the maximum degree over all vertices of the spanning tree. It is easy to see that we cannot obtain a better answer.

Picture corresponding to the third example: [Image]

In this example the number of edges of spanning tree incident to the vertex $2$ is $4$. It is the maximum degree over all vertices of the spanning tree. It is easy to see that we cannot obtain a better answer. But because this example is symmetric, we can choose almost the same spanning tree but with vertex $5$ instead of $2$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find a spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph with maximum degree over all vertices. The maximum degree is the number of edges incident to a vertex. The graph is given as a list of edges, and the task is to find a spanning tree such that the maximum degree over all vertices is maximum possible.

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The basic idea is to start from an arbitrary vertex and explore the graph depth-first, adding edges to the spanning tree as we go. We keep track of the maximum degree over all vertices as we go, and we stop when we have found a spanning tree with the maximum degree.

Here is a step-by-step description of the algorithm:

1. Start with an arbitrary vertex $v_0$ and create an empty spanning tree $T$.
2. Explore the graph depth-first starting from $v_0$. For each vertex $v$ that we visit, add all of its edges to $T$ if they are not already in $T$.
3. Keep track of the maximum degree over all vertices in $T$.

You are given a board of size $n \times n$, where $n$ is odd (not divisible by $2$). Initially, each cell of the board contains one figure.

In one move, you can select exactly one figure presented in some cell and move it to one of the cells sharing a side or a corner with the current cell, i.e. from the cell $(i, j)$ you can move the figure to cells:   $(i - 1, j - 1)$;  $(i - 1, j)$;  $(i - 1, j + 1)$;  $(i, j - 1)$;  $(i, j + 1)$;  $(i + 1, j - 1)$;  $(i + 1, j)$;  $(i + 1, j + 1)$; 

Of course, you can not move figures to cells out of the board. It is allowed that after a move there will be several figures in one cell.

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves needed to get all the figures into one cell (i.e. $n^2-1$ cells should contain $0$ figures and one cell should contain $n^2$ figures).

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$ ($\sum n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$).

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves needed to get all the figures into one cell. We can do this by analyzing the board and finding the shortest path to move all the figures to one cell.

Let's consider a board of size $n \times n$, where $n$ is odd. We can divide the board into four quadrants: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right. Each quadrant has a size of $n/2 \times n/2$.

We can start by moving all the figures in the top-left quadrant to the bottom-right quadrant. We can do this by moving one figure at a time from the top-left quadrant to the bottom-right quadrant, and then moving the figure from the bottom-right quadrant to the top-right quadrant. We can repeat this process until all the figures in the top-left quadrant are moved to the bottom-right quadrant.

Next, we can move all the figures in the top-right quadrant to the bottom-left quadrant. We can do this by moving one figure at a time from the top-right quadrant

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. In one move, you can jump from the position $i$ to the position $i - a_i$ (if $1 \le i - a_i$) or to the position $i + a_i$ (if $i + a_i \le n$).

For each position $i$ from $1$ to $n$ you want to know the minimum the number of moves required to reach any position $j$ such that $a_j$ has the opposite parity from $a_i$ (i.e. if $a_i$ is odd then $a_j$ has to be even and vice versa).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in $a$.

The problem is to find the minimum number of moves required to reach any position $j$ such that $a_j$ has the opposite parity from $a_i$.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D array $dp$ where $dp[i][j]$ represents the minimum number of moves required to reach position $j$ from position $i$.

We can initialize the first row of the array with the values $1, 1, 1, 2, -1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1$. This is because the minimum number of moves required to reach position $j$ from position $i$ is 1 if $j = i + 1, i + 2, i + 3, i + 4, i + 5, i + 6, i + 7, i + 8, i + 9, i + 10$.

We can then fill in the remaining rows of the array using the following recurrence relation:

Nikolay got a string $s$ of even length $n$, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters 'a' and 'b'. Its positions are numbered from $1$ to $n$.

He wants to modify his string so that every its prefix of even length has an equal amount of letters 'a' and 'b'. To achieve that, Nikolay can perform the following operation arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero): choose some position in his string and replace the letter on this position with the other letter (i.e. replace 'a' with 'b' or replace 'b' with 'a'). Nikolay can use no letters except 'a' and 'b'.

The prefix of string $s$ of length $l$ ($1 \le l \le n$) is a string $s[1..l]$.

For example, for the string $s=$"abba" there are two prefixes of the even length. The first is $s[1\dots2]=$"ab" and the second $s[1\dots4]=$"abba". Both of them have the same number of 'a' and 'b'.

Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations Nikolay has to perform with the string $s$ to modify it so that every its prefix of even length has an equal amount of letters 'a' and 'b'.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one even integer $n$ $(2 \le n \le 2\cdot10^{5})$ — the length of string $s$.

The second line of the input contains the string $s$ of length $n$, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters 'a' and 'b'.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of operations Nikolay has to perform with the string $s$ to modify it so that every its prefix of even length has an equal amount of letters 'a' and 'b'.

In the second line print the string Nikolay obtains after applying all the operations. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

-----Note-----

In the first example Nikolay has to perform two operations. For example, he can replace the first 'b' with 'a' and the last 'b' with 'a'. 

In the second example Nikolay doesn't need to do anything because each prefix of an even length of the initial string already contains an equal amount of letters 'a' and 'b'.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of operations needed to modify a string so that every prefix of even length has an equal number of 'a' and 'b' letters.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can define a function $f(i, j)$ that represents the minimum number of operations needed to modify the first $i$ letters of the string so that every prefix of even length has an equal number of 'a' and 'b' letters.

We can define the function recursively as follows:

* If $i = 0$, then $f(0, j) = 0$ because there is no need to modify any letters.
* If $j = 0$, then $f(i, 0) = 1$ because we need to replace the last letter of the string with the other letter.
* If $i > 0$ and $j > 0$, then $f(i, j) = \min(f(i - 1, j), f(i - 1, j - 1)) + 1$. This means that we need to replace the last letter of the string with the other letter

Maksim walks on a Cartesian plane. Initially, he stands at the point $(0, 0)$ and in one move he can go to any of four adjacent points (left, right, up, down). For example, if Maksim is currently at the point $(0, 0)$, he can go to any of the following points in one move:   $(1, 0)$;  $(0, 1)$;  $(-1, 0)$;  $(0, -1)$. 

There are also $n$ distinct key points at this plane. The $i$-th point is $p_i = (x_i, y_i)$. It is guaranteed that $0 \le x_i$ and $0 \le y_i$ and there is no key point $(0, 0)$.

Let the first level points be such points that $max(x_i, y_i) = 1$, the second level points be such points that $max(x_i, y_i) = 2$ and so on. Maksim wants to visit all the key points. But he shouldn't visit points of level $i + 1$ if he does not visit all the points of level $i$. He starts visiting the points from the minimum level of point from the given set.

The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$ where $|v|$ is the absolute value of $v$.

Maksim wants to visit all the key points in such a way that the total distance he walks will be minimum possible. Your task is to find this distance.

If you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of key points.

Each of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$, $y_i$ ($0 \le x_i, y_i \le 10^9$) — $x$-coordinate of the key point $p_i$ and $y$-coordinate of the key point $p_i$. It is guaranteed that all the points are distinct and the point $(0, 0)$ is not in this set.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the shortest path that visits all the key points on a Cartesian plane. The key points are guaranteed to be distinct and the point $(0, 0)$ is not in the set. The path should visit all the key points in a way described above, meaning that the first level points are such points that $max(x_i, y_i) = 1$, the second level points are such points that $max(x_i, y_i) = 2$ and so on. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by visiting the key points in the order of their levels, starting from the minimum level. We then visit the points of the next level only if we have visited all the points of the previous level. We continue this process until we have visited all the key points.

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of key points. The space complexity

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible volume of a rectangular cuboid whose sum of the dimensions is L.

We can start by considering the volume of a rectangular cuboid with dimensions 1, 1, and 1, which is 1.

We can do this by finding the maximum possible volume of a rectangular cuboid with dimensions x, y, and z, where x + y + z = L.

We can do this by finding the maximum possible value of x, y, and z, subject to the constraint that x + y + z = L.

We can do this by solving the following system of equations:

x + y + z = L
x, y, and z are non-negative integers

We can solve this system of equations by using the method of complete the squares.

We can write the system of equations as:

x + y + z = L
(x + y) + z = L
(x + y)^2 + 2z = L^2

2
A
B

-----Output-----
If N=1, print Hello World; if N=2, print A+B.  

-----Sample Input-----
1

-----Sample Output-----
Hello World

As N=1, Takahashi is one year old. Thus, we should print Hello World.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to write a program that receives input from the user and prints the appropriate output based on the input.

First, we need to read the input from the user. We can do this by using the `scanf()` function in C. The `scanf()` function takes a format string as an argument, which specifies the format of the input. In this case, we want to read an integer, so we can use the `%d` format specifier.

Next, we need to check the input to see if it is 1 or 2. If it is 1, we should print "Hello World". If it is 2, we should read two more integers, A and B, and then print A+B.

Here is the code for the program:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);

    if (n == 1) {
        printf("Hello World\n");
    } else if (n == 2) {
        int a, b;
        scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----
3333

We have two strings 444 and 3333. Between them, 3333 is the lexicographically smaller.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to compare two strings of digits, where the first string is the concatenation of b copies of the digit a, and the second string is the concatenation of a copies of the digit b. We need to determine which of these strings is lexicographically smaller.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can compare the two strings character by character, starting from the leftmost character. If the characters are the same, we move on to the next character. If one string is shorter than the other, we know that the shorter string is lexicographically smaller.

For example, let's consider the two strings 444 and 3333. We can compare these strings character by character as follows:

444
3333

Since the first character of the first string is 4, and the first character of the second string is 3, we know that the first string is lexicographically smaller. Therefore, we print 3333 as the answer.

In summary, we can solve this problem by comparing the two strings character by character, starting from the leftmost character. If one string is shorter than

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the letter that comes after the letter C in the alphabet. Since C is not z, we know that C is a lowercase English letter. We need to find the next letter in the alphabet that comes after C.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by defining the alphabet as a list of lowercase English letters. We can then use a for loop to iterate through the alphabet, starting from the letter after C. Once we find the next letter, we can print it and exit the loop.

Here is an example of how this algorithm might work:

1. Define the alphabet as a list of lowercase English letters: alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l','m', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r','s', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']

When S =  oder and T =  atc, concatenating T and S in this order results in atcoder.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to concatenate two strings, T and S, without any spaces in between. The input consists of two strings, S and T, separated by a space. The output is the resulting string after concatenating T and S.

To solve this problem, you need to read the input from the standard input, which consists of two strings separated by a space. Then, you need to concatenate the two strings without any spaces in between. Finally, you need to print the resulting string.

Here's an example of how you can solve this problem:
```
# Read the input from the standard input
S, T = input().split()

# Concatenate the two strings without any spaces in between
result = T + S

# Print the resulting string
print(result)

In this example, we first read the input from the standard input using the `input()` function. We then split the input string into two parts using the `split()` function, which separates the input string into two substrings based on the space character. We then concatenate the two substrings without any spaces in between using the `+` operator. Finally, we print the resulting string using the

Polycarp has an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers.

He wants to play a game with this array. The game consists of several moves. On the first move he chooses any element and deletes it (after the first move the array contains $n-1$ elements). For each of the next moves he chooses any element with the only restriction: its parity should differ from the parity of the element deleted on the previous move. In other words, he alternates parities (even-odd-even-odd-... or odd-even-odd-even-...) of the removed elements. Polycarp stops if he can't make a move.

Formally:   If it is the first move, he chooses any element and deletes it;  If it is the second or any next move:   if the last deleted element was odd, Polycarp chooses any even element and deletes it;  if the last deleted element was even, Polycarp chooses any odd element and deletes it.   If after some move Polycarp cannot make a move, the game ends. 

Polycarp's goal is to minimize the sum of non-deleted elements of the array after end of the game. If Polycarp can delete the whole array, then the sum of non-deleted elements is zero.

Help Polycarp find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2000$) — the number of elements of $a$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 10^6$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum possible sum of non-deleted elements of the array after the game ends. The game ends when Polycarp cannot make a move.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible sum of non-deleted elements of the array after the game ends. We can do this by considering the parity of the elements in the array.

Let's consider the parity of the elements in the array. If the parity of the elements is alternating (i.e., even-odd-even-odd-...), then the sum of non-deleted elements is zero. If the parity of the elements is not alternating, then the sum of non-deleted elements is non-zero.

To find the minimum possible sum of non-deleted elements of the array after the game ends, we need to find the minimum possible sum of non-deleted elements of the array after the game ends, assuming that the parity of the elements is alternating.

Let's consider the case where the parity of the elements is alternating. In this case, the sum of non-deleted elements is zero. We can prove this by considering

There are $n$ monsters standing in a row numbered from $1$ to $n$. The $i$-th monster has $h_i$ health points (hp). You have your attack power equal to $a$ hp and your opponent has his attack power equal to $b$ hp.

You and your opponent are fighting these monsters. Firstly, you and your opponent go to the first monster and fight it till his death, then you and your opponent go the second monster and fight it till his death, and so on. A monster is considered dead if its hp is less than or equal to $0$.

The fight with a monster happens in turns.   You hit the monster by $a$ hp. If it is dead after your hit, you gain one point and you both proceed to the next monster.  Your opponent hits the monster by $b$ hp. If it is dead after his hit, nobody gains a point and you both proceed to the next monster. 

You have some secret technique to force your opponent to skip his turn. You can use this technique at most $k$ times in total (for example, if there are two monsters and $k=4$, then you can use the technique $2$ times on the first monster and $1$ time on the second monster, but not $2$ times on the first monster and $3$ times on the second monster).

Your task is to determine the maximum number of points you can gain if you use the secret technique optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains four integers $n, a, b$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le a, b, k \le 10^9$) — the number of monsters, your attack power, the opponent's attack power and the number of times you can use the secret technique.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n$ ($1 \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $h_i$ is the health points of the $i$-th monster.

We can fill in the table as follows:

* $dp[0][j][k] = 0$ for all $j$ and $k$, since you don't have to fight any monsters if you don't have any.
* $dp[i][j][k] = dp[i-1][j-a][k]$ for all $i$, $j$, and $k$, since you don't have to fight the $i$th monster if you don't have to fight any monsters.
* $dp[i][j][k] = dp[i-1][j][k-1]$ for all $i$, $j$, and $k$, since you can use the secret technique to skip your turn and let your opponent fight the $i$th monster.

You are given an array consisting of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, and a positive integer $m$. It is guaranteed that $m$ is a divisor of $n$.

In a single move, you can choose any position $i$ between $1$ and $n$ and increase $a_i$ by $1$.

Let's calculate $c_r$ ($0 \le r \le m-1)$ — the number of elements having remainder $r$ when divided by $m$. In other words, for each remainder, let's find the number of corresponding elements in $a$ with that remainder.

Your task is to change the array in such a way that $c_0 = c_1 = \dots = c_{m-1} = \frac{n}{m}$.

Find the minimum number of moves to satisfy the above requirement.

This problem can be solved using a technique called "modular arithmetic."

The idea is to consider the array as a circular array, where the last element is connected to the first element. For example, if the array is [3, 2, 0, 6, 10, 12], we can consider it as [3, 2, 0, 6, 10, 12, 3].

Now, let's define a function $f(i)$ that returns the remainder of the element at position $i$ when divided by $m$. For example, if the array is [3, 2, 0, 6, 10, 12], then $f(1) = 2$, $f(2) = 0$, $f(3) = 6 \% 2 = 0$, $f(4) = 10 \% 2 = 0$, $f(5) = 12 \% 2 = 0$, and $f(6) = 3 \% 2 = 1$.

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

Ivan plays a computer game that contains some microtransactions to make characters look cooler. Since Ivan wants his character to be really cool, he wants to use some of these microtransactions — and he won't start playing until he gets all of them.

Each day (during the morning) Ivan earns exactly one burle.

There are $n$ types of microtransactions in the game. Each microtransaction costs $2$ burles usually and $1$ burle if it is on sale. Ivan has to order exactly $k_i$ microtransactions of the $i$-th type (he orders microtransactions during the evening).

Ivan can order any (possibly zero) number of microtransactions of any types during any day (of course, if he has enough money to do it). If the microtransaction he wants to order is on sale then he can buy it for $1$ burle and otherwise he can buy it for $2$ burles.

There are also $m$ special offers in the game shop. The $j$-th offer $(d_j, t_j)$ means that microtransactions of the $t_j$-th type are on sale during the $d_j$-th day.

Ivan wants to order all microtransactions as soon as possible. Your task is to calculate the minimum day when he can buy all microtransactions he want and actually start playing.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 1000$) — the number of types of microtransactions and the number of special offers in the game shop.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $k_1, k_2, \dots, k_n$ ($0 \le k_i \le 1000$), where $k_i$ is the number of copies of microtransaction of the $i$-th type Ivan has to order. It is guaranteed that sum of all $k_i$ is not less than $1$ and not greater than $1000$.

The next $m$ lines contain special offers. The $j$-th of these lines contains the $j$-th special offer. It is given as a pair of integers $(d_j, t_j)$ ($1 \le d_j \le 1000, 1 \le t_j \le n$) and means that microtransactions of the $t_j$-th type are on sale during the $d_j$-th day.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum day when Ivan can order all microtransactions of type i and actually start playing, given that he has already ordered j microtransactions of type i.

The base case is when j = 0, in which case Ivan can start playing immediately.

For the recursive case, we consider two possible scenarios:

1. Ivan orders a microtransaction of type i on the current day. In this case, he can start playing on the next day, which is the current day + 1.
2. Ivan does not order a microtransaction of type i on the current day. In this case, he can start playing on the day when he orders the next microtransaction of type i.

We can calculate the minimum day when Ivan can start playing for each type of microtransaction and each number of microtransactions ordered, and store the result in the dp array.

The final answer is the minimum day when Ivan can start playing, which is the minimum of the dp[i][j] values for all types of microtransactions and all numbers of micro

More formally, if $d$ is the matrix of shortest paths, where $d_{i, j}$ is the length of the shortest path between vertices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \le i < j \le n$), then you need to print the $k$-th element in the sorted array consisting of all $d_{i, j}$, where $1 \le i < j \le n$.

To solve this problem, we need to find the $k$-th smallest shortest path in the graph. We can do this by first computing the matrix of shortest paths, which is a matrix $d$ where $d_{i, j}$ is the length of the shortest path between vertices $i$ and $j$. We can then find the $k$-th smallest element in the sorted array consisting of all $d_{i, j}$, which is the $k$-th smallest shortest path in the graph.

To compute the matrix of shortest paths, we can use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. The algorithm works by maintaining a matrix $d$ where $d_{i, j}$ is the length of the shortest path between vertices $i$ and $j$. We initialize $d$ with the weights of the edges, and then we update $d$ in each iteration by finding the minimum of the following three values:

* The weight of the edge between vertices $i$ and $j$

There are $n$ students at your university. The programming skill of the $i$-th student is $a_i$. As a coach, you want to divide them into teams to prepare them for the upcoming ICPC finals. Just imagine how good this university is if it has $2 \cdot 10^5$ students ready for the finals!

Each team should consist of at least three students. Each student should belong to exactly one team. The diversity of a team is the difference between the maximum programming skill of some student that belongs to this team and the minimum programming skill of some student that belongs to this team (in other words, if the team consists of $k$ students with programming skills $a[i_1], a[i_2], \dots, a[i_k]$, then the diversity of this team is $\max\limits_{j=1}^{k} a[i_j] - \min\limits_{j=1}^{k} a[i_j]$).

The total diversity is the sum of diversities of all teams formed.

Your task is to minimize the total diversity of the division of students and find the optimal way to divide the students.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of students.

In the first example, there is only one team with skills $[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]$ so the answer is $3$. It can be shown that you cannot achieve a better answer.

In the second example, there are two teams with skills $[1, 2, 5]$ and $[12, 13, 15]$ so the answer is $4 + 3 = 7$.

In the third example, there are three teams with skills $[1, 2, 5]$, $[129, 185, 581, 1041]$ and $[1580, 1909, 8150]$ so the answer is $4 + 912 + 6570 = 7486$.

-----Plan-----
This problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization, known as the "Team Diversity" problem. The goal is to divide a set of students into teams such that the diversity of each team is minimized.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. The basic idea is to start by selecting the student with the highest programming skill and form a team with them. Then, we select the next student with the highest programming skill and add them to the team. We continue this process until we have formed all $n$ teams.

To calculate the diversity of each team, we need to calculate the maximum and minimum programming skills of the students in the team. We can do this by keeping track of the maximum and minimum programming skills of the students in each team.

Once we have formed all $n$ teams, we can calculate the total diversity of the division of students by summing the diversity of each team.

The key insight here is that the diversity of a team is a measure of how diverse the team is. A team with a high diversity is more diverse than a team with a low diversity. Therefore, we want to minimize the diversity of each team while still

A positive (strictly greater than zero) integer is called round if it is of the form d00...0. In other words, a positive integer is round if all its digits except the leftmost (most significant) are equal to zero. In particular, all numbers from $1$ to $9$ (inclusive) are round.

For example, the following numbers are round: $4000$, $1$, $9$, $800$, $90$. The following numbers are not round: $110$, $707$, $222$, $1001$.

You are given a positive integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^4$). Represent the number $n$ as a sum of round numbers using the minimum number of summands (addends). In other words, you need to represent the given number $n$ as a sum of the least number of terms, each of which is a round number.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.

Each test case is a line containing an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^4$).


-----Output-----

Print $t$ answers to the test cases. Each answer must begin with an integer $k$ — the minimum number of summands. Next, $k$ terms must follow, each of which is a round number, and their sum is $n$. The terms can be printed in any order. If there are several answers, print any of them.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of round numbers that add up to a given positive integer $n$. We can do this by breaking down the number into its digits and then finding the minimum number of round numbers that add up to each digit.

For example, if we are given the number $n = 5009$, we can break it down into its digits as follows:

5009 = 500 + 9

Now, we need to find the minimum number of round numbers that add up to each digit. For the digit 5, we can use the number 500, which is a round number. For the digit 9, we can use the number 9, which is also a round number. Therefore, the minimum number of round numbers that add up to $n$ is 2, and the answer is 500 + 9 = 509.

In general, we can use the following algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Break down the number $n$ into its digits.
2. For each digit, find the minimum number of round numbers that add up to that digit.

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

There are $n$ kids, each of them is reading a unique book. At the end of any day, the $i$-th kid will give his book to the $p_i$-th kid (in case of $i = p_i$ the kid will give his book to himself). It is guaranteed that all values of $p_i$ are distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ (i.e. $p$ is a permutation). The sequence $p$ doesn't change from day to day, it is fixed.

For example, if $n=6$ and $p=[4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 2]$ then at the end of the first day the book of the $1$-st kid will belong to the $4$-th kid, the $2$-nd kid will belong to the $6$-th kid and so on. At the end of the second day the book of the $1$-st kid will belong to the $3$-th kid, the $2$-nd kid will belong to the $2$-th kid and so on.

Your task is to determine the number of the day the book of the $i$-th child is returned back to him for the first time for every $i$ from $1$ to $n$.

Consider the following example: $p = [5, 1, 2, 4, 3]$. The book of the $1$-st kid will be passed to the following kids:  after the $1$-st day it will belong to the $5$-th kid,  after the $2$-nd day it will belong to the $3$-rd kid,  after the $3$-rd day it will belong to the $2$-nd kid,  after the $4$-th day it will belong to the $1$-st kid. 

So after the fourth day, the book of the first kid will return to its owner. The book of the fourth kid will return to him for the first time after exactly one day.

You have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 200$) — the number of queries. Then $q$ queries follow.

The first line of the query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 200$) — the number of kids in the query. The second line of the query contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$, all $p_i$ are distinct, i.e. $p$ is a permutation), where $p_i$ is the kid which will get the book of the $i$-th kid.


-----Output-----

For each query, print the answer on it: $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, where $a_i$ is the number of the day the book of the $i$-th child is returned back to him for the first time in this query.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the day on which each kid will receive their book back for the first time. The only difference between the easy and hard versions is the constraint that the sequence $p$ is a permutation.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can keep track of the day on which each kid receives their book back for the first time. We can do this by creating an array of size $n$, where $n$ is the number of kids. We can initialize all the elements of the array to -1, which means that no kid has received their book back for the first time yet.

Then, we can iterate through each day and each kid. For each kid, we can check if the book they are currently holding is the same as the book that the kid is supposed to receive on the current day. If it is, then we know that the kid has received their book back for the first time on this day. We can update the array to reflect this.

After we have iterated through all the kids and all the days, we can print the final array, which will contain the day on which each kid received their book back for the first time.

You are both a shop keeper and a shop assistant at a small nearby shop. You have $n$ goods, the $i$-th good costs $a_i$ coins.

You got tired of remembering the price of each product when customers ask for it, thus you decided to simplify your life. More precisely you decided to set the same price for all $n$ goods you have.

However, you don't want to lose any money so you want to choose the price in such a way that the sum of new prices is not less than the sum of the initial prices. It means that if you sell all $n$ goods for the new price, you will receive at least the same (or greater) amount of money as if you sell them for their initial prices.

On the other hand, you don't want to lose customers because of big prices so among all prices you can choose you need to choose the minimum one.

So you need to find the minimum possible equal price of all $n$ goods so if you sell them for this price, you will receive at least the same (or greater) amount of money as if you sell them for their initial prices.

You have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 100$) — the number of queries. Then $q$ queries follow.

The first line of the query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100)$ — the number of goods. The second line of the query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^7$), where $a_i$ is the price of the $i$-th good.

In this problem, we are given $n$ goods, and we need to find the minimum possible equal price of all $n$ goods so that if we sell them for this price, we will receive at least the same (or greater) amount of money as if we sell them for their initial prices.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple optimization algorithm. We can start by setting the price of the first good to be $a_1$. Then, we can set the price of the second good to be $a_2$, and so on.

At each step, we need to make sure that the total amount of money we will receive if we sell all $n$ goods for the current price is not less than the total amount of money we will receive if we sell them for their initial prices. This means that we need to make sure that the sum of the current prices is not less than the sum of the initial prices.

We can use a simple formula to calculate the total amount of money we will receive if we sell all $n$ goods for the current price:

Total amount = (n-1) \* a_1 + (n-2) \* a_2 +...

In BerSoft $n$ programmers work, the programmer $i$ is characterized by a skill $r_i$.

A programmer $a$ can be a mentor of a programmer $b$ if and only if the skill of the programmer $a$ is strictly greater than the skill of the programmer $b$ $(r_a > r_b)$ and programmers $a$ and $b$ are not in a quarrel.

You are given the skills of each programmers and a list of $k$ pairs of the programmers, which are in a quarrel (pairs are unordered). For each programmer $i$, find the number of programmers, for which the programmer $i$ can be a mentor.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ $(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le k \le \min(2 \cdot 10^5, \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}))$ — total number of programmers and number of pairs of programmers which are in a quarrel.

The second line contains a sequence of integers $r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n$ $(1 \le r_i \le 10^{9})$, where $r_i$ equals to the skill of the $i$-th programmer.

Each of the following $k$ lines contains two distinct integers $x$, $y$ $(1 \le x, y \le n$, $x \ne y)$ — pair of programmers in a quarrel. The pairs are unordered, it means that if $x$ is in a quarrel with $y$ then $y$ is in a quarrel with $x$. Guaranteed, that for each pair $(x, y)$ there are no other pairs $(x, y)$ and $(y, x)$ in the input.


-----Output-----

Print $n$ integers, the $i$-th number should be equal to the number of programmers, for which the $i$-th programmer can be a mentor. Programmers are numbered in the same order that their skills are given in the input.

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, the first programmer can not be mentor of any other (because only the second programmer has a skill, lower than first programmer skill, but they are in a quarrel). The second programmer can not be mentor of any other programmer, because his skill is minimal among others. The third programmer can be a mentor of the second programmer. The fourth programmer can be a mentor of the first and of the second programmers. He can not be a mentor of the third programmer, because they are in a quarrel.

-----Plan-----
This problem can be solved using a combination of data structures and algorithms.

First, we can create a data structure to represent the relationships between programmers. We can use a graph data structure, where each node represents a programmer and each edge represents a mentorship relationship. We can also use a hash table to keep track of the number of programmers that each programmer can mentor.

Next, we can process the input and update the graph and the hash table accordingly. For each pair of programmers that are in a quarrel, we can remove the edge between them from the graph and update the hash table to reflect that the second programmer can no longer be mentored by the first programmer.

Finally, we can iterate over the graph and update the hash table to reflect the number of programmers that each programmer can mentor. We can then print the hash table as the output.

The time complexity of this solution is $O(n + k)$, where $n$ is the number of programmers and $k$ is the number of pairs of programmers that are in a quarrel. The space complexity is $O(n + k)$, where $n$ is the number of programmers and $k$ is

Authors have come up with the string $s$ consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters.

You are given two permutations of its indices (not necessary equal) $p$ and $q$ (both of length $n$). Recall that the permutation is the array of length $n$ which contains each integer from $1$ to $n$ exactly once.

For all $i$ from $1$ to $n-1$ the following properties hold: $s[p_i] \le s[p_{i + 1}]$ and $s[q_i] \le s[q_{i + 1}]$. It means that if you will write down all characters of $s$ in order of permutation indices, the resulting string will be sorted in the non-decreasing order.

Your task is to restore any such string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of at least $k$ distinct lowercase Latin letters which suits the given permutations.

If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le k \le 26$) — the length of the string and the number of distinct characters required.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$, all $p_i$ are distinct integers from $1$ to $n$) — the permutation $p$.

If it is impossible to find the suitable string, print "NO" on the first line.

Otherwise print "YES" on the first line and string $s$ on the second line. It should consist of $n$ lowercase Latin letters, contain at least $k$ distinct characters and suit the given permutations.

This problem is a classic problem in computer science known as the "Permutation Problem". The problem is to find a permutation of a string of length $n$ that has at least $k$ distinct characters and is sorted in non-decreasing order.

The solution to this problem is to use a technique called "backtracking". The basic idea of backtracking is to start with an empty string and recursively add characters to it until we have a string of length $n$ that meets the requirements.

Here's a high-level description of the algorithm:

1. Start with an empty string.
2. For each character in the string, check if it is already in the string. If it is, move on to the next character.
3. If the character is not in the string, add it to the string and recursively call the function with the updated string.
4. If the string is of length $n$, check if it has at least $k$ distinct characters. If it does, return the string.
5. If the string is not of length $n$ or does not have at least $k$ distinct characters, backtrack and remove the last character from

Recently Vasya decided to improve his pistol shooting skills. Today his coach offered him the following exercise. He placed $n$ cans in a row on a table. Cans are numbered from left to right from $1$ to $n$. Vasya has to knock down each can exactly once to finish the exercise. He is allowed to choose the order in which he will knock the cans down.

Vasya knows that the durability of the $i$-th can is $a_i$. It means that if Vasya has already knocked $x$ cans down and is now about to start shooting the $i$-th one, he will need $(a_i \cdot x + 1)$ shots to knock it down. You can assume that if Vasya starts shooting the $i$-th can, he will be shooting it until he knocks it down.

Your task is to choose such an order of shooting so that the number of shots required to knock each of the $n$ given cans down exactly once is minimum possible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ $(2 \le n \le 1\,000)$ — the number of cans.

The second line of the input contains the sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ $(1 \le a_i \le 1\,000)$, where $a_i$ is the durability of the $i$-th can.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of shots required to knock each of the $n$ given cans down exactly once.

In the second line print the sequence consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ — the order of indices of cans that minimizes the number of shots required. If there are several answers, you can print any of them.

-----Note-----

In the first example Vasya can start shooting from the first can. He knocks it down with the first shot because he haven't knocked any other cans down before. After that he has to shoot the third can. To knock it down he shoots $20 \cdot 1 + 1 = 21$ times. After that only second can remains. To knock it down Vasya shoots $10 \cdot 2 + 1 = 21$ times. So the total number of shots is $1 + 21 + 21 = 43$.

In the second example the order of shooting does not matter because all cans have the same durability.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of shots required to knock down all $n$ cans exactly once, where the durability of each can is given by $a_i$. The solution is to shoot the cans in the following order:

1. Shoot the can with the highest durability first.
2. Shoot the can with the second highest durability.
3. Shoot the can with the third highest durability.
4. Repeat step 1 until all cans are knocked down.

This solution works because the durability of each can is at least 1, so the total number of shots required to knock down all cans is at least the sum of the durabilities of all cans. By shooting the cans in the order described above, we can ensure that each can is knocked down exactly once, and the total number of shots required is minimized.

i=1, 2, and 4 satisfy the condition, but i=3 does not - for example, P_i > P_j holds for j = 1.

Similarly, i=5 does not satisfy the condition, either. Thus, there are three integers that satisfy the condition.

The problem is to find the number of integers i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) that satisfy the following condition:

For any integer j (1 ≤ j ≤ i), P_i ≤ P_j.

The solution is to iterate through the permutation P_1,..., P_N and keep track of the current maximum value for each index i.

At each step, we check if the current value at index i is less than or equal to the maximum value for any index j less than or equal to i. If it is, we increment a counter to keep track of the number of integers that satisfy the condition.

Once we have iterated through the entire permutation, we print the counter as the final answer.

We can, for example, remove one occurrence of 3. Then, (3, 3, 3) is a good sequence.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of elements that needs to be removed from a sequence so that it becomes a good sequence. A good sequence is defined as a sequence where each element occurs exactly the number of times it appears in the sequence.

To solve this problem, we can use a hash table to keep track of the number of occurrences of each element in the sequence. We can then iterate through the sequence and remove any elements that do not have the correct number of occurrences.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Python:
```
def solution(a):
    # Create a hash table to keep track of the number of occurrences of each element
    counts = {}
    for element in a:
        if element in counts:

To solve this problem, we can start by looking at the values of the variables. If the value of x_i is 0, then we know that Snuke assigned 0 to x_i. We can check each variable in turn to see which one has a value of 0.

We can start by checking x_1, since it was initially assigned the value of 1. If x_1 has a value of 0, then we know that Snuke assigned 0 to x_1. We can print the value of i, which is 1, to indicate that Snuke assigned 0 to x_1.

If x_1 does not have a value of 0, then we can move on to the next variable, x_2. We can repeat this process until we find the variable that has a value of 0.

In the sample input given, x_1 has a value of 0, so we know that S

There is a bar of chocolate with a height of H blocks and a width of W blocks.
Snuke is dividing this bar into exactly three pieces.
He can only cut the bar along borders of blocks, and the shape of each piece must be a rectangle.
Snuke is trying to divide the bar as evenly as possible.
More specifically, he is trying to minimize S_{max} - S_{min}, where S_{max} is the area (the number of blocks contained) of the largest piece, and S_{min} is the area of the smallest piece.
Find the minimum possible value of S_{max} - S_{min}.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 ≤ H, W ≤ 10^5

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H W

-----Output-----
Print the minimum possible value of S_{max} - S_{min}.

-----Sample Input-----
3 5

-----Sample Output-----
0

In the division below, S_{max} - S_{min} = 5 - 5 = 0.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible value of S_{max} - S_{min}.

Let's consider the following division of the bar:

[ ] [ ] [ ]

In this division, the largest piece has an area of 5 blocks (the three blocks on the right side), and the smallest piece has an area of 5 blocks (the three blocks on the left side).

The difference between the areas of the largest and smallest pieces is 5 - 5 = 0.

Now, let's consider another division of the bar:

[ ] [ ] [ ]

In this division, the largest piece has an area of 6 blocks (the three blocks on the right side), and the smallest piece has an area of 4 blocks (the three blocks on the left side).

The difference between the areas of the largest and smallest pieces is 6 - 4 = 2.

We can see that the difference between the areas of the largest and smallest pieces is minimized when the largest piece has an area of 5 blocks and the smallest piece has an area of 4 blocks.

Therefore, the minimum possible value of

1 10 100

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

One solution is (1, 100, 10).

-----Plan-----
The problem is to determine whether it is possible to rearrange the elements of a sequence so that the product of each pair of consecutive elements is a multiple of 4.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by considering the first element of the sequence, and then consider the second element. If the product of the first two elements is not a multiple of 4, we can swap them. We can continue this process until we reach the end of the sequence.

For example, consider the sequence (1, 10, 100). We can start by considering the first two elements, which have a product of 10. Since 10 is not a multiple of 4, we can swap them, so the sequence becomes (10, 1, 100).

Next, we consider the third element, which has a product of 100 with the second element. Since 100 is a multiple of 4, we can keep the third element in its current position.

Finally, we consider the fourth element, which has a product of 100 with the third element. Since 100 is a multiple

You are given strings s and t, consisting of lowercase English letters.
You will create a string s' by freely rearranging the characters in s.
You will also create a string t' by freely rearranging the characters in t.
Determine whether it is possible to satisfy s' < t' for the lexicographic order.

-----Notes-----
For a string a = a_1 a_2 ... a_N of length N and a string b = b_1 b_2 ... b_M of length M, we say a < b for the lexicographic order if either one of the following two conditions holds true:
 - N < M and a_1 = b_1, a_2 = b_2, ..., a_N = b_N.
 - There exists i (1 \leq i \leq N, M) such that a_1 = b_1, a_2 = b_2, ..., a_{i - 1} = b_{i - 1} and a_i < b_i. Here, letters are compared using alphabetical order.
For example, xy < xya and atcoder < atlas.

 - The lengths of s and t are between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
 - s and t consists of lowercase English letters.

-----Output-----
If it is possible to satisfy s' < t', print Yes; if it is not, print No.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----

We can, for example, rearrange yx into xy and axy into yxa. Then, xy < yxa.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to determine whether it is possible to rearrange the characters in s and t such that the resulting strings satisfy the lexicographic order.

We can do this by comparing the characters in s and t one by one, and checking if the resulting strings satisfy the lexicographic order. If we can rearrange the characters in s and t such that the resulting strings satisfy the lexicographic order, we print "Yes". Otherwise, we print "No".

Here's an example of how we can solve this problem:

s = "yx"
t = "axy"

We can rearrange the characters in s and t as follows:

s' = "xy"
t' = "yxa"

Then, we can check if s' < t'. Since xy < yxa, we print "Yes".

In summary, we can solve this problem by comparing the characters in s and t one by one, and checking if the resulting strings satisfy the lexicographic order. If we can rearrange the characters in s and t such that the resulting strings satisfy the lexicographic order, we print "Yes". Otherwise, we print "No".

It is allowed to select as many integers as you like, and as large integers as you wish.

-----Output-----

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----

For example, if you select 7 and 14, the sum 21 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to determine whether it is possible to select some positive integers that satisfy the given constraints and make the sum congruent to C modulo B.

First, we need to find the multiples of A that are less than or equal to B. We can do this by using the formula:

Ax = B (mod B)

where x is the number of multiples of A that are less than or equal to B.

For example, if A = 7 and B = 14, we can find the number of multiples of 7 that are less than or equal to 14 by solving the equation:

7x = 14 (mod 14)

x = 2

So, there are 2 multiples of 7 that are less than or equal to 14.

Next, we need to select at least one integer from each of these multiples of A. We can do this by selecting the smallest integer from each multiple of A.

For example, if we select the smallest integer from each of the 2 multiples of 7 that are less than or equal to 14, we

-----Note-----
It can be proved that the positions of the roads do not affect the area.

-----Output-----
Print the area of this yard excluding the roads (in square yards).

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----
1

In this case, the area is 1 square yard.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the farm excluding the roads. We can do this by subtracting the area of the roads from the total area of the farm.

First, we need to find the area of the roads. The area of the vertical road is A yards x B yards, and the area of the horizontal road is B yards x A yards. So, the total area of the roads is A x B + B x A = 2A x B + B x A = 2(A + B) x A x B.

Next, we need to find the area of the farm. The area of the farm is A x B x 2, since the farm is a rectangle with length A and width B.

Now, we can subtract the area of the roads from the area of the farm to find the area of the farm excluding the roads. The area of the farm excluding the roads is A x B x 2 - 2(A + B) x A x B = A x B x 2 - 2A x B x A = A x B x 2 - A x B x 2 = 0.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum number of people that can sit on a long seat of width X centimeters, with a minimum gap of Z centimeters between each person. The people are sitting in intervals of length Y centimeters, and there must be a gap of at least Z centimeters between the end of the seat and the last person.

To solve this problem, we can start by dividing the seat into intervals of length Y + 2Z centimeters. Since the people are sitting in intervals of length Y centimeters, we can fit as many people as possible in each interval.

We can then calculate the maximum number of people that can sit on the seat by dividing the total width of the seat by the width of each interval. Since the last person must be at least Z centimeters away from the end of the seat, we can subtract Z centimeters from the total width of the seat to get the maximum width of each interval.

For example, if the seat is 13 centimeters wide and the people are sitting in intervals of length 3 centimeters, we can fit 4 people in each interval. If we subtract 1 centimeter from the total

On a two-dimensional plane, there are N red points and N blue points.

A red point and a blue point can form a friendly pair when, the x-coordinate of the red point is smaller than that of the blue point, and the y-coordinate of the red point is also smaller than that of the blue point.

For example, you can pair (2, 0) and (4, 2), then (3, 1) and (5, 5).

-----Plan-----
This problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to sort the red points and blue points by their x-coordinates, and then pair the red points with the blue points that have the smallest x-coordinates.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. Sort the red points and blue points by their x-coordinates.
2. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.
3. Iterate through the sorted red points and blue points in parallel.
4. For each pair of red point and blue point, check if the x-coordinate of the red point is smaller than that of the blue point, and if the y-coordinate of the red point is also smaller than that of the blue point. If both conditions are true, then increment `count` by 1.
5. Print the maximum value of `count`.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N log N), where N is the number of red points and blue points. The space complexity is O(N), since we need to store the sorted red points and blue points in memory.

Here's a sample Python code that implements this algorithm:

Three seconds after the first person pushes the water, the switch is pushed again and the shower emits water for four more seconds, for a total of seven seconds.

The problem is asking for the total number of seconds that the shower will emit water for, given the following conditions:

* There are N people who will push a switch that controls the shower.
* The shower emits water for T seconds when the switch is pushed.
* Each person pushes the switch t_i seconds after the first person pushes it.

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of seconds that the shower will emit water for. We can do this by keeping track of the number of seconds that the shower has been emitting water for at each moment in time.

Let's call the number of seconds that the shower has been emitting water for at a given moment in time "x". We can represent x as an array of size N, where x[i] represents the number of seconds that the shower has been emitting water for since the i-th person pushed the switch.

We can initialize x[0] to 0, since the shower has not been emitting water at the beginning. Then, for each person i, we can update x[i] as follows:

You have got a shelf and want to put some books on it.

You are given $q$ queries of three types:  L $id$ — put a book having index $id$ on the shelf to the left from the leftmost existing book;  R $id$ — put a book having index $id$ on the shelf to the right from the rightmost existing book;  ? $id$ — calculate the minimum number of books you need to pop from the left or from the right in such a way that the book with index $id$ will be leftmost or rightmost. 

You can assume that the first book you will put can have any position (it does not matter) and queries of type $3$ are always valid (it is guaranteed that the book in each such query is already placed). You can also assume that you don't put the same book on the shelf twice, so $id$s don't repeat in queries of first two types.

Your problem is to answer all the queries of type $3$ in order they appear in the input.

Note that after answering the query of type $3$ all the books remain on the shelf and the relative order of books does not change.

If you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.

The first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of queries.

Then $q$ lines follow. The $i$-th line contains the $i$-th query in format as in the problem statement. It is guaranteed that queries are always valid (for query type $3$, it is guaranteed that the book in each such query is already placed, and for other types, it is guaranteed that the book was not placed before).

-----Plan-----
This problem can be solved using a data structure called a "doubly-linked list". A doubly-linked list is a type of linked list where each node has a reference to both the previous and next node in the list. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes at any position in the list.

To solve this problem, we can use a doubly-linked list to keep track of the books on the shelf. We can initialize the list with the first book on the shelf, and then process each query in order.

For each query of type L, we can insert the book at the beginning of the list. This is done by creating a new node for the book and inserting it at the beginning of the list.

For each query of type R, we can insert the book at the end of the list. This is done by creating a new node for the book and inserting it at the end of the list.

For each query of type?, we can find the position of the book in the list by iterating through the list until we find the book. We can then calculate the minimum number of books that need to be popped from the left or right

You are given some Tetris field consisting of $n$ columns. The initial height of the $i$-th column of the field is $a_i$ blocks. On top of these columns you can place only figures of size $2 \times 1$ (i.e. the height of this figure is $2$ blocks and the width of this figure is $1$ block). Note that you cannot rotate these figures.

Your task is to say if you can clear the whole field by placing such figures.

More formally, the problem can be described like this:

The following process occurs while at least one $a_i$ is greater than $0$:  You place one figure $2 \times 1$ (choose some $i$ from $1$ to $n$ and replace $a_i$ with $a_i + 2$);  then, while all $a_i$ are greater than zero, replace each $a_i$ with $a_i - 1$. 

And your task is to determine if it is possible to clear the whole field (i.e. finish the described process), choosing the places for new figures properly.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases.

The first test case of the example field is shown below:

[Image]

Gray lines are bounds of the Tetris field. Note that the field has no upper bound.

One of the correct answers is to first place the figure in the first column. Then after the second step of the process, the field becomes $[2, 0, 2]$. Then place the figure in the second column and after the second step of the process, the field becomes $[0, 0, 0]$.

And the second test case of the example field is shown below:

$\square$

It can be shown that you cannot do anything to end the process.

In the third test case of the example, you first place the figure in the second column after the second step of the process, the field becomes $[0, 2]$. Then place the figure in the first column and after the second step of the process, the field becomes $[0, 0]$.

In the fourth test case of the example, place the figure in the first column, then the field becomes $[102]$ after the first step of the process, and then the field becomes $[0]$ after the second step of the process.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to determine if it is possible to clear the whole Tetris field by placing figures of size $2 \times 1$. The field consists of $n$ columns, and the initial height of the $i$-th column is $a_i$ blocks. The process consists of placing a figure of size $2 \times 1$ on top of each column, and then reducing the height of each column by $1$ block.

To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to clear the whole field by placing figures of size $2 \times 1$ in such a way that the height of each column becomes $0$ after the second step of the process.

We can start by placing a figure of size $2 \times 1$ in the first column. After the second step of the process, the height of the first column becomes $1$ block, and the height of the other columns remains unchanged.

Next, we can place a figure of size $2 \times 1$ in the second column. After the second step of the process, the height of the second column becomes $1$ block, and the height of the first column becomes $0$

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
You are given two strings $a$ and $b$ consisting of lowercase English letters, both of length $n$. The characters of both strings have indices from $1$ to $n$, inclusive. 

You are allowed to do the following changes:   Choose any index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) and swap characters $a_i$ and $b_i$;  Choose any index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) and swap characters $a_i$ and $a_{n - i + 1}$;  Choose any index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) and swap characters $b_i$ and $b_{n - i + 1}$. 

Note that if $n$ is odd, you are formally allowed to swap $a_{\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil}$ with $a_{\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil}$ (and the same with the string $b$) but this move is useless. Also you can swap two equal characters but this operation is useless as well.

You have to make these strings equal by applying any number of changes described above, in any order. But it is obvious that it may be impossible to make two strings equal by these swaps.

In one preprocess move you can replace a character in $a$ with another character. In other words, in a single preprocess move you can choose any index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$), any character $c$ and set $a_i := c$.

Your task is to find the minimum number of preprocess moves to apply in such a way that after them you can make strings $a$ and $b$ equal by applying some number of changes described in the list above.

Note that the number of changes you make after the preprocess moves does not matter. Also note that you cannot apply preprocess moves to the string $b$ or make any preprocess moves after the first change is made.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the length of strings $a$ and $b$.

The second line contains the string $a$ consisting of exactly $n$ lowercase English letters.

The third line contains the string $b$ consisting of exactly $n$ lowercase English letters.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of preprocess moves to apply before changes, so that it is possible to make the string $a$ equal to string $b$ with a sequence of changes from the list above.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

In the first example preprocess moves are as follows: $a_1 := $'b', $a_3 := $'c', $a_4 := $'a' and $a_5:=$'b'. Afterwards, $a = $"bbcabba". Then we can obtain equal strings by the following sequence of changes: $swap(a_2, b_2)$ and $swap(a_2, a_6)$. There is no way to use fewer than $4$ preprocess moves before a sequence of changes to make string equal, so the answer in this example is $4$.

In the second example no preprocess moves are required. We can use the following sequence of changes to make $a$ and $b$ equal: $swap(b_1, b_5)$, $swap(a_2, a_4)$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the minimum number of preprocess moves to apply before changes, so that it is possible to make the string $a$ equal to string $b$ with a sequence of changes from the list above.

To solve this problem, you need to find the minimum number of preprocess moves that can make the string $a$ equal to the string $b$. The preprocess moves can be applied in any order, but the number of changes you make after the preprocess moves does not matter.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this problem:

1. Check if the strings $a$ and $b$ are already equal. If they are, then the answer is 0.
2. If the strings are not equal, then check if the length of the strings is odd. If the length is odd, then the answer is -1, because it is impossible to make the strings equal by swapping characters.
3. If the length is even, then check if the characters in the strings are equal. If the characters are equal, then the answer is 0.
4. If the characters are not equal, then find the first index $i$ where the

A frog is currently at the point $0$ on a coordinate axis $Ox$. It jumps by the following algorithm: the first jump is $a$ units to the right, the second jump is $b$ units to the left, the third jump is $a$ units to the right, the fourth jump is $b$ units to the left, and so on.

Formally:   if the frog has jumped an even number of times (before the current jump), it jumps from its current position $x$ to position $x+a$;  otherwise it jumps from its current position $x$ to position $x-b$. 

Your task is to calculate the position of the frog after $k$ jumps.

But... One more thing. You are watching $t$ different frogs so you have to answer $t$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of queries.

Each of the next $t$ lines contain queries (one query per line).

The query is described as three space-separated integers $a, b, k$ ($1 \le a, b, k \le 10^9$) — the lengths of two types of jumps and the number of jumps, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print $t$ integers. The $i$-th integer should be the answer for the $i$-th query.


-----Example-----
Input
6
5 2 3
100 1 4
1 10 5

1 1 999999999

Output
8
198
-17
2999999997
0
1



-----Note-----

In the first query frog jumps $5$ to the right, $2$ to the left and $5$ to the right so the answer is $5 - 2 + 5 = 8$.

In the second query frog jumps $100$ to the right, $1$ to the left, $100$ to the right and $1$ to the left so the answer is $100 - 1 + 100 - 1 = 198$.

In the third query the answer is $1 - 10 + 1 - 10 + 1 = -17$.

In the fourth query the answer is $10^9 - 1 + 10^9 - 1 + 10^9 - 1 = 2999999997$.

In the fifth query all frog's jumps are neutralized by each other so the answer is $0$.

The sixth query is the same as the fifth but without the last jump so the answer is $1$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to calculate the position of a frog after $k$ jumps, where the frog jumps by alternating between two types of jumps, where the first type of jump is $a$ units to the right and the second type of jump is $b$ units to the left. The problem also states that we have to answer $t$ independent queries, where $t$ is the number of queries.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that keeps track of the current position of the frog and the number of jumps it has made. We can start by initializing the current position of the frog to $0$ and the number of jumps to $0$.

For each query, we can calculate the position of the frog after the $k$th jump by checking if the number of jumps is even or odd. If the number of jumps is even, we can calculate the position of the frog by adding $a$ to the current position. If the number of jumps is odd, we can calculate the position of the frog by subtracting $b$ from the current position.

Once we have calculated the position of the frog

The only difference between easy and hard versions is the maximum value of $n$.

You are given a positive integer number $n$. You really love good numbers so you want to find the smallest good number greater than or equal to $n$.

The positive integer is called good if it can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of $3$ (i.e. no duplicates of powers of $3$ are allowed).

For example:

  $30$ is a good number: $30 = 3^3 + 3^1$,  $1$ is a good number: $1 = 3^0$,  $12$ is a good number: $12 = 3^2 + 3^1$,  but $2$ is not a good number: you can't represent it as a sum of distinct powers of $3$ ($2 = 3^0 + 3^0$),  $19$ is not a good number: you can't represent it as a sum of distinct powers of $3$ (for example, the representations $19 = 3^2 + 3^2 + 3^0 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^1 + 3^1 + 3^0$ are invalid),  $20$ is also not a good number: you can't represent it as a sum of distinct powers of $3$ (for example, the representation $20 = 3^2 + 3^2 + 3^0 + 3^0$ is invalid). 

Note, that there exist other representations of $19$ and $20$ as sums of powers of $3$ but none of them consists of distinct powers of $3$.

For the given positive integer $n$ find such smallest $m$ ($n \le m$) that $m$ is a good number.

You have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$) — the number of queries. Then $q$ queries follow.

The only line of the query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{18}$).

The problem is asking you to find the smallest good number greater than or equal to $n$. A good number is a number that can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 3. For example, 30 is a good number because it can be represented as 3^3 + 3^1.

To solve this problem, you can use a simple algorithm that checks if a number is a good number by trying to represent it as a sum of distinct powers of 3. If a number is not a good number, you can increment it by 1 until you find a good number.

Here is an example of how you can solve this problem:

1. Read the input: The first line of the input contains the number of queries, $q$. The next $q$ lines contain the queries, each containing a positive integer $n$.
2. Initialize the smallest good number: Set the smallest good number to 1.

You are given four integers $a$, $b$, $x$ and $y$. Initially, $a \ge x$ and $b \ge y$. You can do the following operation no more than $n$ times:

  Choose either $a$ or $b$ and decrease it by one. However, as a result of this operation, value of $a$ cannot become less than $x$, and value of $b$ cannot become less than $y$. 

Your task is to find the minimum possible product of $a$ and $b$ ($a \cdot b$) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than $n$ times.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains five integers $a$, $b$, $x$, $y$ and $n$ ($1 \le a, b, x, y, n \le 10^9$). Additional constraint on the input: $a \ge x$ and $b \ge y$ always holds.

-----Note-----

In the first test case of the example, you need to decrease $b$ three times and obtain $10 \cdot 7 = 70$.

In the second test case of the example, you need to decrease $a$ one time, $b$ one time and obtain $11 \cdot 7 = 77$.

In the sixth test case of the example, you need to decrease $a$ five times and obtain $5 \cdot 11 = 55$.

In the seventh test case of the example, you need to decrease $b$ ten times and obtain $10 \cdot 1 = 10$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible product of $a$ and $b$ that can be achieved by applying the given operation no more than $n$ times.

We can start by observing that the operation of decreasing either $a$ or $b$ by one cannot make the value of $a$ or $b$ less than $x$ or $y$, respectively. Therefore, we can safely assume that $a \ge x$ and $b \ge y$.

We can also observe that the product of $a$ and $b$ is always greater than or equal to the product of $x$ and $y$. Therefore, we can start by setting the product of $a$ and $b$ to be equal to the product of $x$ and $y$.

Now, we can apply the operation no more than $n$ times. Each time we apply the operation, we decrease either $a$ or $b$ by one. Therefore, we can start by decreasing $a$ or $b$ by one, whichever is greater.

If $a$ is greater, we decrease $a$ by one and set $a = a -

In this problem, we are given two positive integers $a$ and $b$. We can perform two types of operations on $a$:

2. Subtract $y$, where $y$ is a positive even integer.

We can perform these operations any number of times. We need to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain $b$ from $a$.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D array $dp$ of size $1001 \times 1001$, where $dp[i][j]$ represents the minimum number of moves required to obtain $j$ from $i$.

We can initialize $dp[i][i] = 0$, as we don't need to do anything to obtain the same number.

For each $i \neq j$, we can calculate $dp[i][j]$ as follows:

Call an apartment boring, if its number consists of the same digit. Examples of boring apartments are $11, 2, 777, 9999$ and so on.

Our character is a troublemaker, and he calls the intercoms of all boring apartments, till someone answers the call, in the following order:

The resident of the boring apartment $x$ answers the call, and our character stops calling anyone further.

Our character wants to know how many digits he pressed in total and your task is to help him to count the total number of keypresses.

For example, if the resident of boring apartment $22$ answered, then our character called apartments with numbers $1, 11, 111, 1111, 2, 22$ and the total number of digits he pressed is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 13$.

The total number of digits pressed by our character is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + x + x1 + x11 + x111 + x1111 + \ldots$.

We can simplify this expression by noticing that the number of digits in each apartment number is equal to the number of digits in the previous apartment number plus one. Therefore, the total number of digits pressed by our character is equal to the number of digits in $x$ plus the number of

You have to choose exactly two sequences $i$ and $j$ ($i \ne j$) such that you can remove exactly one element in each of them in such a way that the sum of the changed sequence $i$ (its length will be equal to $n_i - 1$) equals to the sum of the changed sequence $j$ (its length will be equal to $n_j - 1$).

Note that it's required to remove exactly one element in each of the two chosen sequences.

Assume that the sum of the empty (of the length equals $0$) sequence is $0$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $k$ ($2 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of sequences.

Then $k$ pairs of lines follow, each pair containing a sequence.

The first line in the $i$-th pair contains one integer $n_i$ ($1 \le n_i < 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of the $i$-th sequence. The second line of the $i$-th pair contains a sequence of $n_i$ integers $a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \dots, a_{i, n_i}$.

The elements of sequences are integer numbers from $-10^4$ to $10^4$.

The sum of lengths of all given sequences don't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$, i.e. $n_1 + n_2 + \dots + n_k \le 2 \cdot 10^5$.

It means that the sum of the elements of the $i$-th sequence without the element with index $x$ equals to the sum of the elements of the $j$-th sequence without the element with index $y$.

Two chosen sequences must be distinct, i.e. $i \ne j$. You can print them in any order.

To solve this problem, you need to find the last element in each sequence, and then remove that element from the sequence. Then, you need to find the sum of the remaining elements in each sequence, and compare them to see if they are equal.

Given an array A of integers, we must modify the array in the following way: we choose an i and replace A[i] with -A[i], and we repeat this process K times in total.  (We may choose the same index i multiple times.)
Return the largest possible sum of the array after modifying it in this way.

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 10000
1 <= K <= 10000

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the largest possible sum of an array after modifying it in a specific way. The modification involves replacing each element with its negative value, and repeating this process K times.

To solve this problem, we can start by sorting the array in descending order. This will ensure that the largest elements are replaced with their negative values first, which will have the greatest impact on the overall sum.

Next, we can use a sliding window technique to keep track of the maximum sum of the array over the last K elements. At each step, we will remove the last element from the array and add the negative of that element to the sum. We will also remove the first element from the array and add its negative to the sum.

The key insight here is that the sum of the array over the last K elements is equal to the sum of the array over the first K elements, minus the sum of the first K elements. This is because the first K elements are the same as the last K elements, but with their negative values.

By using this property, we can reduce the time complexity of the algorithm from O(nK) to O(K) by only considering the first K elements of the array

Given an array A of integers, return true if and only if we can partition the array into three non-empty parts with equal sums.
Formally, we can partition the array if we can find indexes i+1 < j with (A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[i] == A[i+1] + A[i+2] + ... + A[j-1] == A[j] + A[j-1] + ... + A[A.length - 1])
 
Example 1:
Input: A = [0,2,1,-6,6,-7,9,1,2,0,1]
Output: true
Explanation: 0 + 2 + 1 = -6 + 6 - 7 + 9 + 1 = 2 + 0 + 1

Example 2:
Input: A = [0,2,1,-6,6,7,9,-1,2,0,1]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: A = [3,3,6,5,-2,2,5,1,-9,4]
Output: true
Explanation: 3 + 3 = 6 = 5 - 2 + 2 + 5 + 1 - 9 + 4

 
Constraints:

3 <= A.length <= 50000
-10^4 <= A[i] <= 10^4

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find if we can partition the array into three non-empty parts with equal sums. We can do this by finding two indexes i and j such that the sum of the elements from index 0 to i is equal to the sum of the elements from index i+1 to j-1, and the sum of the elements from index j to the end is equal to the sum of the elements from index 0 to i-1.

We can use a hash table to keep track of the sums of the elements in the array. We can iterate through the array and for each element, we can check if the sum of the elements from index 0 to the current index is equal to the sum of the elements from the current index to the end of the array. If we find a pair of indexes that satisfy this condition, we return true.

If we don't find a pair of indexes that satisfy this condition, we return false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array, because we need to iterate through the array once to find the two indexes i and j.

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), because

 - 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - S_i (1 \leq i \leq N) are strings consisting of lowercase English letters.

-----Sample Output-----

beet and vet are written on two sheets each, while beat, bed, and bet are written on one vote each. Thus, we should print the strings beet and vet.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the most common string among the N voting papers. We can solve this problem by using a hash table to keep track of the number of times each string appears on a voting paper.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input: The first line of input contains the number of voting papers (N). The next N lines contain the strings written on each voting paper.
2. Initialize the hash table: Create a hash table with the keys being the strings and the values being the number of times each string appears on a voting paper.
3. Count the number of times each string appears: For each string, increment the value associated with that string in the hash table by 1.
4. Find the most common string: Find the string that appears the most number of times in the hash table.
5. Print the most common string: Print the most common string in lexicographical order.

Evi has N integers a_1,a_2,..,a_N. His objective is to have N equal integers by transforming some of them.
He may transform each integer at most once. Transforming an integer x into another integer y costs him (x-y)^2 dollars. Even if a_i=a_j (i≠j), he has to pay the cost separately for transforming each of them (See Sample 2).
Find the minimum total cost to achieve his objective.

-----Output-----
Print the minimum total cost to achieve Evi's objective.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----
8

Transforming the both into 6s will cost (4-6)^2+(8-6)^2=8 dollars, which is the minimum.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum cost to transform the integers to make them all equal. We can do this by finding the minimum cost to transform each integer to its closest integer that is equal to another integer.

Let's consider the first integer, a_1. We need to find the closest integer that is equal to another integer. If there is no such integer, then we can transform a_1 to the closest integer that is greater than or equal to a_1.

Let's say the closest integer that is equal to another integer is a_2. Then, we need to transform a_1 to a_2 by paying the cost of (a_1-a_2)^2 dollars.

Now, we need to find the minimum cost to transform the remaining integers to make them all equal. We can do this by finding the minimum cost to transform each integer to its closest integer that is equal to another integer.

Let's consider the second integer, a_2. We need to find the closest integer that is equal to another integer. If there is no such integer, then we can transform a_2 to the closest integer that is greater than or equal to a_

-----Sample Output-----
84

You have 1234 - 150 = 1084 yen left after buying a cake.
With this amount, you can buy 10 donuts, after which you have 84 yen left.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money you have left after buying a cake and as many donuts as possible.

First, we buy a cake for A yen at a cake shop. This means we have X - A yen left.

Next, we buy as many donuts as possible for B yen each, at a donut shop. We can buy as many donuts as possible because we have X - A yen left, and each donut costs B yen.

Let's say we buy D donuts. Then, we have X - A - BD yen left.

We can keep buying donuts until we don't have enough money left. So, we keep buying donuts until we have 0 yen left.

In this case, we have 1084 - 150 - 100 = 84 yen left.

Therefore, the amount you have left after shopping is 84 yen.

Snuke has N dogs and M monkeys. He wants them to line up in a row.
As a Japanese saying goes, these dogs and monkeys are on bad terms. ("ken'en no naka", literally "the relationship of dogs and monkeys", means a relationship of mutual hatred.) Snuke is trying to reconsile them, by arranging the animals so that there are neither two adjacent dogs nor two adjacent monkeys.
How many such arrangements there are? Find the count modulo 10^9+7 (since animals cannot understand numbers larger than that).
Here, dogs and monkeys are both distinguishable. Also, two arrangements that result from reversing each other are distinguished.

-----Constraints-----

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M

-----Output-----
Print the number of possible arrangements, modulo 10^9+7.

-----Sample Output-----

We will denote the dogs by A and B, and the monkeys by C and D. There are eight possible arrangements: ACBD, ADBC, BCAD, BDAC, CADB, CBDA, DACB and DBCA.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the number of ways to arrange the dogs and monkeys in a row such that there are no two adjacent dogs or two adjacent monkeys.

We can solve this problem using a recursive approach. Let's define a function, `f(N, M)`, that returns the number of ways to arrange `N` dogs and `M` monkeys in a row.

The base case is when `N = 1` or `M = 1`. In this case, there is only one way to arrange the dogs and monkeys, which is to place the dog or monkey in the first position.

Now, let's consider the recursive case. We can arrange the dogs and monkeys in a row in `f(N-1, M)` ways, where the last dog is placed in the first position. We can also arrange the dogs and monkeys in a row in `f(N, M-1)` ways, where the last monkey is placed in the first position.

However, we need to exclude the cases where two adjacent dogs or two adjacent monkeys are placed in the first position. We can do this by subtracting the number of

In Takahashi Kingdom, there is an archipelago of N islands, called Takahashi Islands.
For convenience, we will call them Island 1, Island 2, ..., Island N.
There are M kinds of regular boat services between these islands.
Each service connects two islands. The i-th service connects Island a_i and Island b_i.
Cat Snuke is on Island 1 now, and wants to go to Island N.
However, it turned out that there is no boat service from Island 1 to Island N, so he wants to know whether it is possible to go to Island N by using two boat services.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find a path between Island 1 and Island N using two boat services. We can start by finding all the pairs of islands that are connected by boat services. We can do this by creating a graph where each island is a node, and two islands are connected by an edge if there is a boat service between them.

Once we have the graph, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find a path between Island 1 and Island N. We can start at Island 1 and explore all the nodes that are reachable from it. If we find a node that is equal to Island N, we can print POSSIBLE. If we reach a node that is not equal to Island N, we can backtrack and try another path.

If we cannot find a path between Island 1 and Island N, we can print IMPOSSIBLE.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Create a graph with N nodes, where each node represents an island.
2. For each boat service, add an edge between the two islands that it connects.

Extract the first character a, the third character c, the fifth character d and the seventh character r to obtain acdr.

To solve this problem, we need to extract all the characters in the odd-indexed positions from the input string s. We can do this by iterating through the characters of s and checking if the index of the current character is odd. If it is, we add it to a new string. Once we have iterated through all the characters, we print the new string.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input string s from Standard Input.
2. Initialize an empty string to store the characters in the odd-indexed positions.

2. The last character in string B and the initial character in string C are the same.

A string is written on each card. The string written on the i-th blue card is s_i, and the string written on the i-th red card is t_i.
Takahashi will now announce a string, and then check every card. Each time he finds a blue card with the string announced by him, he will earn 1 yen (the currency of Japan); each time he finds a red card with that string, he will lose 1 yen.
Here, we only consider the case where the string announced by Takahashi and the string on the card are exactly the same. For example, if he announces atcoder, he will not earn money even if there are blue cards with atcoderr, atcode, btcoder, and so on. (On the other hand, he will not lose money even if there are red cards with such strings, either.)
At most how much can he earn on balance?
Note that the same string may be written on multiple cards.

You will travel to the bottom-right square, (2, N), by repeatedly moving right or down.
The square (i, j) contains A_{i, j} candies.

The number of collected candies will be maximized when you:
 - move right three times, then move down once, then move right once.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the maximum number of candies that can be collected by traveling from the top-left square to the bottom-right square in the 2 x N grid. The grid is represented as a 2 x N matrix, where each element A[i][j] represents the number of candies in the square at row i and column j.

The best way to travel from the top-left square to the bottom-right square is to move right three times, then move down once, then move right once. This will result in the maximum number of candies being collected.

To calculate the maximum number of candies that can be collected, you need to calculate the sum of the candies in the top-left square, the bottom-right square, and the squares in between. The sum of the candies in the top-left square is A[1][1], the sum of the candies in the bottom-right square is A[2][N], and the sum of the candies in the squares in between is the sum of all the candies in the matrix.

Therefore, the maximum number of candies that can be collected is A[1][1] +

Eat one candy in the second box.
Then, the number of candies in each box becomes (2, 1, 2).

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve the objective, which is to have at most x candies in each pair of neighboring boxes.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by eating one candy from each box that has at least one candy. This will ensure that the number of candies in each pair of neighboring boxes is at most x.

After eating the candies, we can sort the boxes in non-decreasing order of the number of candies in each box. This will ensure that the number of candies in each pair of neighboring boxes is at most x.

We can then iterate through the sorted boxes and eat one candy from each box that has at least one candy. This will ensure that the number of candies in each pair of neighboring boxes is at most x.

The time complexity of this approach is O(N log N) and the space complexity is O(N).

The correctness of this approach can be proven as follows:

We have a 3 \times 3 grid. A number c_{i, j} is written in the square (i, j), where (i, j) denotes the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left.

According to Takahashi, there are six integers a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, b_3 whose values are fixed, and the number written in the square (i, j) is equal to a_i + b_j.

Determine if he is correct.  

-----Constraints-----
 - c_{i, j} \ (1 \leq i \leq 3, 1 \leq j \leq 3) is an integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive).

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
c_{1,1} c_{1,2} c_{1,3}
c_{2,1} c_{2,2} c_{2,3}
c_{3,1} c_{3,2} c_{3,3}

-----Output-----
If Takahashi's statement is correct, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
1 0 1
2 1 2
1 0 1

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

Takahashi is correct, since there are possible sets of integers such as: a_1=0,a_2=1,a_3=0,b_1=1,b_2=0,b_3=1.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to determine if Takahashi's statement is correct. Takahashi's statement is that there are six integers a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, b_3 whose values are fixed, and the number written in the square (i, j) is equal to a_i + b_j.

To solve this problem, we need to check if there is a possible set of integers that satisfies Takahashi's statement. We can start by considering the values of a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, b_3.

Let's consider the first row of the grid. The number written in the first square is equal to a_1 + b_1, which is 1 + 1 = 2. The number written in the second square is equal to a_2 + b_2, which is 0 + 1 = 1. The number written in the third square is equal to a_3 + b_3, which is 1 + 0 = 1.

AtCoder Inc. holds a contest every Saturday.
There are two types of contests called ABC and ARC, and just one of them is held at a time.
The company holds these two types of contests alternately: an ARC follows an ABC and vice versa.
Given a string S representing the type of the contest held last week, print the string representing the type of the contest held this week.

-----Constraints-----
 - S is ABC or ARC.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
Print the string representing the type of the contest held this week.

-----Sample Input-----
ABC

-----Sample Output-----
ARC

They held an ABC last week, so they will hold an ARC this week.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to determine the type of contest that will be held next week based on the type of contest that was held last week. The company holds two types of contests, ABC and ARC, and they alternate between the two.

To solve this problem, you need to consider the following information:

* The company holds two types of contests, ABC and ARC.
* The company holds these two types of contests alternately: an ARC follows an ABC and vice versa.
* Given a string S representing the type of the contest held last week, print the string representing the type of the contest held this week.

To solve this problem, you can use the following steps:

1. If the string S is "ABC", then the next week's contest will be an ARC.
2. If the string S is "ARC", then the next week's contest will be an ABC.

So, if the string S is "ABC", then print "ARC" as the answer. If the string S is "ARC", then print "ABC" as the answer.

There are three integers between 4 and 8, inclusive, that are divisible by 2: 4, 6 and 8.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the number of integers between a and b, inclusive, that are divisible by x. To solve this problem, we need to find the number of integers between a and b that are divisible by x.

We can start by finding the number of integers between a and b, inclusive. This can be done by subtracting a from b and adding 1 to get the total number of integers between a and b.

Next, we need to find the number of integers between a and b that are divisible by x. We can do this by checking each integer between a and b and counting the number of integers that are divisible by x.

For example, if a = 4, b = 8, and x = 2, we need to find the number of integers between 4 and 8, inclusive, that are divisible by 2. We can do this by checking each integer between 4 and 8, inclusive, and counting the number of integers that are divisible by 2.

Takahashi loves numbers divisible by 2.
You are given a positive integer N. Among the integers between 1 and N (inclusive), find the one that can be divisible by 2 for the most number of times. The solution is always unique.
Here, the number of times an integer can be divisible by 2, is how many times the integer can be divided by 2 without remainder.
For example,
 - 6 can be divided by 2 once: 6 -> 3.
 - 8 can be divided by 2 three times: 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1.
 - 3 can be divided by 2 zero times.

4 can be divided by 2 twice, which is the most number of times among 1, 2, ..., 7.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the number between 1 and N (inclusive) that can be divisible by 2 for the most number of times. To solve this problem, you need to find the number that can be divided by 2 for the longest time.

To do this, you can start by finding the number that can be divided by 2 for the longest time. You can do this by dividing each number between 1 and N (inclusive) by 2 and counting how many times you can divide it without remainder. The number that can be divided by 2 for the longest time will be the one with the highest count.

For example, if N = 7, then the numbers between 1 and 7 (inclusive) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. To find the number that can be divided by 2 for the longest time, you can start by dividing 1 by 2:

1 / 2 = 0 with remainder 1

So, 1 cannot be divided by 2 for the longest time. Next, you can divide 2 by 2:

To solve this problem, we need to determine if there is a path between A and C that is less than or equal to d meters long. We can do this by checking if there is a path between A and B that is less than or equal to d meters long, and then checking if there is a path between B and C that is less than or equal to d meters long. If there is a path between A and B and between B and C, then we can conclude that there is a path between A and C that is less than or equal to d meters long, and therefore A and C can communicate.

An elementary school student Takahashi has come to a variety store.
He has two coins, A-yen and B-yen coins (yen is the currency of Japan), and wants to buy a toy that costs C yen. Can he buy it?
Note that he lives in Takahashi Kingdom, and may have coins that do not exist in Japan.

-----Constraints-----
 - All input values are integers.
 - 1 \leq A, B \leq 500
 - 1 \leq C \leq 1000

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B C

-----Output-----
If Takahashi can buy the toy, print Yes; if he cannot, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
50 100 120

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

He has 50 + 100 = 150 yen, so he can buy the 120-yen toy.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to determine if Takahashi can buy the toy with the coins he has.

First, we need to calculate the total value of the coins Takahashi has. We can do this by adding the value of the A-yen coin to the value of the B-yen coin.

Next, we need to compare the total value of the coins to the cost of the toy. If the total value is greater than or equal to the cost of the toy, then Takahashi can buy the toy.

If the total value is less than the cost of the toy, then Takahashi cannot buy the toy.

In the sample input, Takahashi has 50 + 100 = 150 yen, which is greater than or equal to 120, so we print Yes.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the number of ways to select one or more cards from N cards such that the average of the integers written on the selected cards is exactly A.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to select the cards such that the average of the integers written on the selected cards is exactly A.

We can solve this problem using the concept of combinations.

Let's consider the following:

* We have N cards, and each card has an integer written on it.
* We need to select one or more cards such that the average of the integers written on the selected cards is exactly A.
* The average of the integers written on the selected cards is exactly A if the sum of the integers written on the selected cards is equal to A times the number of selected cards.

So, we need to find the number of ways to select the cards such that the sum of the integers written on the selected cards is equal to A times the number of selected cards.

We can use the formula for the number of combinations:

n! / (k! \* (n-k)!)

where n is the total number of cards, k is the number

The monster's health is initially H, and Raccoon has N special moves that can be used to decrease the monster's health. Each move has a certain amount A_i that it decreases the monster's health by.

To solve this problem, we need to find out whether it is possible for Raccoon to win the fight without using the same move twice or more. We can do this by checking whether it is possible to use all the moves to decrease the monster's health to 0 or below.

We can start by checking whether it is possible to use all the moves to decrease the monster's health to 0 or below.

 - abaababaab itself is even, but we need to delete at least one character.
 - abaababaa is not even.
 - abaababa is not even.
 - abaabab is not even.
 - abaaba is even. Thus, we should print its length, 6.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the longest even substring that can be obtained by deleting one or more characters from the end of the given string.

We can start by finding the length of the given string, which is the number of characters in the string. Let's call this length N.

Next, we need to find the longest even substring of the given string. We can do this by iterating through the string from the end and checking if the substring is even. If it is, we can keep track of the length of the substring.

If the substring is not even, we can continue iterating through the string until we find the next even substring. Once we find an even substring, we can keep track of its length and continue iterating through the string until we reach the end.

Once we have iterated through the entire string, we can print the length of the longest even substring that we found.

To solve this problem, we need to determine if the given string S can be obtained by permuting the characters of the string "abc".

We can do this by checking if the characters in S are present in the string "abc" and if they are in the correct order.

We can use a for loop to iterate through the characters in S and check if they are present in the string "abc". If we find a character that is not present in "abc", we know that S cannot be obtained by permuting "abc".

If we find a character that is present in "abc" but not in the correct order, we need to check if the remaining characters in S are present in "abc" in the correct order. If they are, we know that S can be obtained by permuting "abc".

If we find a character that is present in "abc" and in the correct order, we can remove that character from S and continue checking the remaining characters.

If we reach the end of S without finding any characters that are not present in "abc" or not in the correct order, we know that S can be obtained by permuting "abc".

Let's define a function $f(l, r) = \sum\limits_{l \le i \le r} a_i \cdot b_i$.

Your task is to reorder the elements (choose an arbitrary order of elements) of the array $b$ to minimize the value of $\sum\limits_{1 \le l \le r \le n} f(l, r)$. Since the answer can be very large, you have to print it modulo $998244353$. Note that you should minimize the answer but not its remainder.

The problem is to find the minimum value of the sum of the products of the elements of two arrays, where the elements of one array are rearranged. The arrays are given in the input, and the output is the minimum possible value of the sum of the products of the elements of the rearranged array, modulo 998244353.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a two-dimensional array dp, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum value of the sum of the products of the elements of the rearranged array, where the first i elements of the array are rearranged, and the last j elements are not rearranged.

We can fill the dp array in a bottom-up manner, starting from the last row. For each row, we can calculate the minimum value of the sum of the products of the elements of the rearranged array, by considering all possible combinations of the first i elements of the array, and the last j elements of the array.

We can use a hash table to store the values of the sum of the products of the elements of the rearranged array for each combination of

There are $n$ shovels in the nearby shop. The $i$-th shovel costs $a_i$ bourles.

Misha has to buy exactly $k$ shovels. Each shovel can be bought no more than once.

Misha can buy shovels by several purchases. During one purchase he can choose any subset of remaining (non-bought) shovels and buy this subset.

There are also $m$ special offers in the shop. The $j$-th of them is given as a pair $(x_j, y_j)$, and it means that if Misha buys exactly $x_j$ shovels during one purchase then $y_j$ most cheapest of them are for free (i.e. he will not pay for $y_j$ most cheapest shovels during the current purchase).

Misha can use any offer any (possibly, zero) number of times, but he cannot use more than one offer during one purchase (but he can buy shovels without using any offers).

Your task is to calculate the minimum cost of buying $k$ shovels, if Misha buys them optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n, m$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le k \le min(n, 2000)$) — the number of shovels in the shop, the number of special offers and the number of shovels Misha has to buy, correspondingly.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the cost of the $i$-th shovel.

The next $m$ lines contain special offers. The $j$-th of them is given as a pair of integers $(x_i, y_i)$ ($1 \le y_i \le x_i \le n$) and means that if Misha buys exactly $x_i$ shovels during some purchase, then he can take $y_i$ most cheapest of them for free.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum cost of buying $k$ shovels if Misha buys them optimally.

-----Note-----

In the first example Misha can buy shovels on positions $1$ and $4$ (both with costs $2$) during the first purchase and get one of them for free using the first or the third special offer. And then he can buy shovels on positions $3$ and $6$ (with costs $4$ and $3$) during the second purchase and get the second one for free using the first or the third special offer. Then he can buy the shovel on a position $7$ with cost $1$. So the total cost is $4 + 2 + 1 = 7$.

In the second example Misha can buy shovels on positions $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ and $8$ (costs are $6$, $8$, $5$, $1$ and $2$) and get three cheapest (with costs $5$, $1$ and $2$) for free. And then he can buy shovels on positions $6$, $7$ and $9$ (all with costs $1$) without using any special offers. So the total cost is $6 + 8 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17$.

In the third example Misha can buy four cheapest shovels without using any special offers and get the total cost $17$.

-----Plan-----
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can define a function $f(i, j)$ that represents the minimum cost of buying $j$ shovels from the first $i$ shovels, where $i$ is the number of shovels and $j$ is the number of shovels to buy.

We can use the following recurrence relation to calculate $f(i, j)$:

$$f(i, j) = \min\left\{f(i-1, j-1) + a_i, f(i-1, j) + a_i\right\}$$

where $a_i$ is the cost of the $i$th shovel.

The first term in the recurrence relation represents the cost of buying the $i$th shovel and the remaining $j-1$ shovels without using any special offers. The second term in the recurrence relation represents the cost of buying the $i$th shovel and the remaining $j$ shovels using the first special offer.

We can also use the following recurrence relation to calculate the minimum cost of buying $

Your task is to add the minimum number of edges in such a way that the length of the shortest path from the vertex $1$ to any other vertex is at most $2$. Note that you are not allowed to add loops and multiple edges.

The following $n - 1$ lines contain edges: edge $i$ is given as a pair of vertices $u_i, v_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$). It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is guaranteed that there are no loops and multiple edges in the given edges.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of edges that need to be added to a given undirected tree such that the shortest path from vertex 1 to any other vertex is at most 2. The tree is guaranteed to be connected and there are no loops or multiple edges.

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The basic idea is to start from vertex 1 and explore the tree by adding edges one by one. We keep track of the shortest distance from vertex 1 to any other vertex and update it whenever we add a new edge.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the algorithm works:

1. Initialize the shortest distance from vertex 1 to any other vertex as infinity.
2. Start from vertex 1 and explore the tree by adding edges one by one.
3. For each edge that we add, we update the shortest distance from vertex 1 to the other vertex. If the shortest distance is greater than the length of the edge, we update it to the length of the edge.
4. If we add an edge that connects two vertices that are already connected, we do not update the

Each test case is two positive integers $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$) and $k$ ($1 \le k \le 10^9$).

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the $k$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $n$. We can do this by finding the $k$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $n$ for each test case.

For each test case, we can start with the first positive integer that is not divisible by $n$, which is $1$. Then, we can increment the integer by $n$ until we reach the $k$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $n$.

For example, if $n=3$ and $k=7$, we start with the first positive integer that is not divisible by $3$, which is $1$. Then, we increment by $3$ until we reach the $7$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $3$, which is $10$.

Therefore, the output for the first test case is $10$.

For the second test case, we start with the first positive integer that is not divisible by $4$, which is $1$. Then, we increment by $4$ until we reach the $12$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $4

The only difference between easy and hard versions are constraints on $n$ and $k$.

You are messaging in one of the popular social networks via your smartphone. Your smartphone can show at most $k$ most recent conversations with your friends. Initially, the screen is empty (i.e. the number of displayed conversations equals $0$).

Each conversation is between you and some of your friends. There is at most one conversation with any of your friends. So each conversation is uniquely defined by your friend.

You (suddenly!) have the ability to see the future. You know that during the day you will receive $n$ messages, the $i$-th message will be received from the friend with ID $id_i$ ($1 \le id_i \le 10^9$).

If you receive a message from $id_i$ in the conversation which is currently displayed on the smartphone then nothing happens: the conversations of the screen do not change and do not change their order, you read the message and continue waiting for new messages.

Otherwise (i.e. if there is no conversation with $id_i$ on the screen):

  Firstly, if the number of conversations displayed on the screen is $k$, the last conversation (which has the position $k$) is removed from the screen.  Now the number of conversations on the screen is guaranteed to be less than $k$ and the conversation with the friend $id_i$ is not displayed on the screen.  The conversation with the friend $id_i$ appears on the first (the topmost) position on the screen and all the other displayed conversations are shifted one position down. 

Your task is to find the list of conversations (in the order they are displayed on the screen) after processing all $n$ messages.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of messages and the number of conversations your smartphone can show.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $id_1, id_2, \dots, id_n$ ($1 \le id_i \le 10^9$), where $id_i$ is the ID of the friend which sends you the $i$-th message.


-----Output-----

In the first line of the output print one integer $m$ ($1 \le m \le min(n, k)$) — the number of conversations shown after receiving all $n$ messages.

In the second line print $m$ integers $ids_1, ids_2, \dots, ids_m$, where $ids_i$ should be equal to the ID of the friend corresponding to the conversation displayed on the position $i$ after receiving all $n$ messages.

-----Note-----

In the first example the list of conversations will change in the following way (in order from the first to last message):

  $[]$;  $[1]$;  $[2, 1]$;  $[3, 2]$;  $[3, 2]$;  $[1, 3]$;  $[1, 3]$;  $[2, 1]$. 

In the second example the list of conversations will change in the following way:

  $[]$;  $[2]$;  $[3, 2]$;  $[3, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 2]$;  and then the list will not change till the end.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the list of conversations after processing all $n$ messages. The only difference between the easy and hard versions is the constraint on $n$ and $k$.

The solution is to maintain a list of conversations, where each conversation is represented by a list of friend IDs. The list is initially empty.

For each message, we need to check if the conversation with the friend ID is already displayed on the screen. If it is, then we do nothing. If not, we need to add the conversation to the list.

If the number of conversations displayed on the screen is $k$, then we remove the last conversation from the list. We then add the conversation with the friend ID to the list, and shift all the other displayed conversations down by one position.

The final list of conversations is the list of conversations in the order they are displayed on the screen.

The time complexity of the solution is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of messages. The space complexity is $O(k)$, where $k$ is the number of conversations that can be displayed on the screen.

You are playing a computer card game called Splay the Sire. Currently you are struggling to defeat the final boss of the game.

The boss battle consists of $n$ turns. During each turn, you will get several cards. Each card has two parameters: its cost $c_i$ and damage $d_i$. You may play some of your cards during each turn in some sequence (you choose the cards and the exact order they are played), as long as the total cost of the cards you play during the turn does not exceed $3$. After playing some (possibly zero) cards, you end your turn, and all cards you didn't play are discarded. Note that you can use each card at most once.

Your character has also found an artifact that boosts the damage of some of your actions: every $10$-th card you play deals double damage.

What is the maximum possible damage you can deal during $n$ turns?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of turns.

Then $n$ blocks of input follow, the $i$-th block representing the cards you get during the $i$-th turn.

Each block begins with a line containing one integer $k_i$ ($1 \le k_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of cards you get during $i$-th turn. Then $k_i$ lines follow, each containing two integers $c_j$ and $d_j$ ($1 \le c_j \le 3$, $1 \le d_j \le 10^9$) — the parameters of the corresponding card.

It is guaranteed that $\sum \limits_{i = 1}^{n} k_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$.

Print one integer — the maximum damage you may deal.

-----Note-----

In the example test the best course of action is as follows:

During the first turn, play all three cards in any order and deal $18$ damage.

During the second turn, play both cards and deal $7$ damage.

During the third turn, play the first and the third card and deal $13$ damage.

During the fourth turn, play the first and the third card and deal $25$ damage.

During the fifth turn, play the only card, which will deal double damage ($200$).

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible damage we can deal during $n$ turns. We can do this by considering all possible combinations of cards we can play during each turn, and finding the maximum damage we can deal in each combination.

Let's consider the first turn. We can play any number of cards during the first turn, as long as the total cost of the cards we play does not exceed $3$. Let's say we play $k$ cards during the first turn. We can choose any $k$ cards from the $n$ cards we received, and play them in any order. The total cost of the cards we play during the first turn is at most $3$, so the total cost of all $k$ cards is at most $3k$.

Now, let's consider the second turn. We can play any number of cards during the second turn, as long as the total cost of the cards we play does not exceed $3$. Let's say we play $k$ cards during the second turn. We can choose any $k$ cards from the $n$ cards we received, and play them in any order. The total cost of the cards we play during the

You are given a string $s$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters and $q$ queries for this string.

Recall that the substring $s[l; r]$ of the string $s$ is the string $s_l s_{l + 1} \dots s_r$. For example, the substrings of "codeforces" are "code", "force", "f", "for", but not "coder" and "top".

There are two types of queries:   $1~ pos~ c$ ($1 \le pos \le |s|$, $c$ is lowercase Latin letter): replace $s_{pos}$ with $c$ (set $s_{pos} := c$);  $2~ l~ r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le |s|$): calculate the number of distinct characters in the substring $s[l; r]$. 


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one string $s$ consisting of no more than $10^5$ lowercase Latin letters.

The second line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 10^5$) — the number of queries.

The next $q$ lines contain queries, one per line. Each query is given in the format described in the problem statement. It is guaranteed that there is at least one query of the second type.

The problem is asking us to find the number of distinct characters in a given substring of a string. The substring is defined by two indices, $l$ and $r$, which represent the starting and ending positions of the substring in the string.

The first type of query is to replace the character at position $pos$ with a new character $c$. The second type of query is to find the number of distinct characters in the substring $s[l; r]$.

To solve this problem, we can use a data structure called a hash table, which is a type of associative array that maps keys to values. In this case, we can use a hash table to keep track of the number of times each character appears in the string.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize a hash table $H$ with an empty array.
2. For each character $c$ in the string $s$, add $c$ to $H$ with a value of 1 if it is not already in $H$. If $c$ is already in $H$, increment its value by 1.

The anti-sudoku is the $9 \times 9$ field, in which:  Any number in this field is in range $[1; 9]$;  each row contains at least two equal elements;  each column contains at least two equal elements;  each $3 \times 3$ block (you can read what is the block in the link above) contains at least two equal elements.

To solve this problem, we need to find a way to change at most 9 elements of the given sudoku solution so that it becomes an anti-sudoku.

An anti-sudoku is a 9x9 field in which:

* Any number in this field is in range [1; 9]
* Each row contains at least two equal elements
* Each column contains at least two equal elements
* Each 3x3 block contains at least two equal elements

We can start by looking at the rows and columns of the given sudoku solution. We can see that each row and column contains at least two equal elements, which means that we can change at most 9 elements in each row and column to make it an anti-sudoku.

Next, we can look at the 3x3 blocks. We can see that each block contains at least two equal elements, which means that we can change at most 9 elements in each block to make it an anti-sudoku.

Now, we can combine these two constraints to get the final answer. We can change at most 9 elements in each row, column, and block to make it an anti-s

In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.

There are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.

Officer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$;  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. 

For example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.

The structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.

Formally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.

Berland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.

To process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.

Suppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ — one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.

Let's look at the following example: [Image] 

If officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.

If officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.

If officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.

If officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.

To answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.

You should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.

The second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \dots, p_n$ ($1 \le p_i < i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.

The next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \le u_i, k_i \le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.


-----Output-----

Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print "-1" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.

You should process queries independently. They do not affect each other.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to help Berland army organize their command delivery system. The army is represented as a tree, where each officer is a vertex and the parent of a vertex is the direct superior of the officer. The problem is asking us to process $q$ queries, where each query is asking us to find the $k_i$th officer in the order in which a command will be delivered if it starts from a given officer $u_i$.

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm works by starting at a given vertex and exploring all of its children before moving on to any of its siblings. In this case, we can use the DFS algorithm to explore the tree and find the $k_i$th officer in the order in which a command will be delivered.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to solve the problem using DFS:

1. Start at the vertex corresponding to the officer $u_i$ who starts the command.
2. Explore all of the children of the current vertex. If the current vertex has $k_i$ children, we can stop and

Polycarp has three sisters: Alice, Barbara, and Cerene. They're collecting coins. Currently, Alice has $a$ coins, Barbara has $b$ coins and Cerene has $c$ coins. Recently Polycarp has returned from the trip around the world and brought $n$ coins.

He wants to distribute all these $n$ coins between his sisters in such a way that the number of coins Alice has is equal to the number of coins Barbara has and is equal to the number of coins Cerene has. In other words, if Polycarp gives $A$ coins to Alice, $B$ coins to Barbara and $C$ coins to Cerene ($A+B+C=n$), then $a + A = b + B = c + C$.

Note that A, B or C (the number of coins Polycarp gives to Alice, Barbara and Cerene correspondingly) can be 0.

Your task is to find out if it is possible to distribute all $n$ coins between sisters in a way described above.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.

The next $t$ lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on a new line and consists of four space-separated integers $a, b, c$ and $n$ ($1 \le a, b, c, n \le 10^8$) — the number of coins Alice has, the number of coins Barbara has, the number of coins Cerene has and the number of coins Polycarp has.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if Polycarp can distribute all $n$ coins between his sisters and "NO" otherwise.

-----Plan-----
In this problem, we are given a set of coins and we need to distribute them among three sisters in such a way that the number of coins each sister has is equal.

Let's consider the following cases:

1. If the number of coins Polycarp has is equal to the sum of the number of coins each sister has, then it is possible to distribute the coins among the sisters in such a way that the number of coins each sister has is equal.
2. If the number of coins Polycarp has is not equal to the sum of the number of coins each sister has, then it is not possible to distribute the coins among the sisters in such a way that the number of coins each sister has is equal.

So, we need to check if the number of coins Polycarp has is equal to the sum of the number of coins each sister has. If it is, then we can distribute the coins among the sisters in such a way that the number of coins each sister has is equal. If it is not, then we cannot distribute the coins among the sisters in such a way that

Let's define $p_i(n)$ as the following permutation: $[i, 1, 2, \dots, i - 1, i + 1, \dots, n]$. This means that the $i$-th permutation is almost identity (i.e. which maps every element to itself) permutation but the element $i$ is on the first position. Examples:  $p_1(4) = [1, 2, 3, 4]$;  $p_2(4) = [2, 1, 3, 4]$;  $p_3(4) = [3, 1, 2, 4]$;  $p_4(4) = [4, 1, 2, 3]$. 

You are given an array $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_m$ ($1 \le x_i \le n$).

Let $pos(p, val)$ be the position of the element $val$ in $p$. So, $pos(p_1(4), 3) = 3, pos(p_2(4), 2) = 1, pos(p_4(4), 4) = 1$.

Let's define a function $f(p) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m - 1} |pos(p, x_i) - pos(p, x_{i + 1})|$, where $|val|$ is the absolute value of $val$. This function means the sum of distances between adjacent elements of $x$ in $p$.

Your task is to calculate $f(p_1(n)), f(p_2(n)), \dots, f(p_n(n))$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in each permutation and the number of elements in $x$.

The second line of the input contains $m$ integers ($m$, not $n$) $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_m$ ($1 \le x_i \le n$), where $x_i$ is the $i$-th element of $x$. Elements of $x$ can repeat and appear in arbitrary order.

-----Note-----

Consider the first example:

$x = [1, 2, 3, 4]$, so  for the permutation $p_1(4) = [1, 2, 3, 4]$ the answer is $|1 - 2| + |2 - 3| + |3 - 4| = 3$;  for the permutation $p_2(4) = [2, 1, 3, 4]$ the answer is $|2 - 1| + |1 - 3| + |3 - 4| = 4$;  for the permutation $p_3(4) = [3, 1, 2, 4]$ the answer is $|2 - 3| + |3 - 1| + |1 - 4| = 6$;  for the permutation $p_4(4) = [4, 1, 2, 3]$ the answer is $|2 - 3| + |3 - 4| + |4 - 1| = 5$. 

Consider the second example:

$x = [2, 1, 5, 3, 5]$, so  for the permutation $p_1(5) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ the answer is $|2 - 1| + |1 - 5| + |5 - 3| + |3 - 5| = 9$;  for the permutation $p_2(5) = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]$ the answer is $|1 - 2| + |2 - 5| + |5 - 3| + |3 - 5| = 8$;  for the permutation $p_3(5) = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]$ the answer is $|3 - 2| + |2 - 5| + |5 - 1| + |1 - 5| = 12$;  for the permutation $p_4(5) = [4, 1, 2, 3, 5]$ the answer is $|3 - 2| + |2 - 5| + |5 - 4| + |4 - 5| = 6$;  for the permutation $p_5(5) = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]$ the answer is $|3 - 2| + |2 - 1| + |1 - 4| + |4 - 1| = 8$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to calculate the sum of distances between adjacent elements of an array $x$ in each of the $n$ permutations $p_1(n), p_2(n), \dots, p_n(n)$.

To solve this problem, we need to find the position of each element in each permutation. We can do this by finding the position of each element in the permutation $p_i(n)$ and then finding the difference between the position of each element in the permutation and the position of the next element in the permutation.

For example, if we have the permutation $p_1(4) = [1, 2, 3, 4]$, we can find the position of each element in the permutation by finding the position of each element in the array $x$ in the permutation. So, the position of the element $1$ in the permutation $p_1(4)$ is $1$, the position of the element $2$ in the permutation $p_1(4)$ is $2$, the position of the element $3$ in the permutation $p_1(4)$ is $3$, and the position of

You are given a rooted tree consisting of $n$ vertices numbered from $1$ to $n$. The root of the tree is a vertex number $1$.

A tree is a connected undirected graph with $n-1$ edges.

You are given $m$ queries. The $i$-th query consists of the set of $k_i$ distinct vertices $v_i[1], v_i[2], \dots, v_i[k_i]$. Your task is to say if there is a path from the root to some vertex $u$ such that each of the given $k$ vertices is either belongs to this path or has the distance $1$ to some vertex of this path.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries.

Each of the next $n-1$ lines describes an edge of the tree. Edge $i$ is denoted by two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$, the labels of vertices it connects $(1 \le u_i, v_i \le n, u_i \ne v_i$).

It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

The next $m$ lines describe queries. The $i$-th line describes the $i$-th query and starts with the integer $k_i$ ($1 \le k_i \le n$) — the number of vertices in the current query. Then $k_i$ integers follow: $v_i[1], v_i[2], \dots, v_i[k_i]$ ($1 \le v_i[j] \le n$), where $v_i[j]$ is the $j$-th vertex of the $i$-th query.

It is guaranteed that all vertices in a single query are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $k_i$ does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$ ($\sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} k_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).


-----Output-----

For each query, print the answer — "YES", if there is a path from the root to some vertex $u$ such that each of the given $k$ vertices is either belongs to this path or has the distance $1$ to some vertex of this path and "NO" otherwise.

Consider the queries.

The first query is $[3, 8, 9, 10]$. The answer is "YES" as you can choose the path from the root $1$ to the vertex $u=10$. Then vertices $[3, 9, 10]$ belong to the path from $1$ to $10$ and the vertex $8$ has distance $1$ to the vertex $7$ which also belongs to this path.

The second query is $[2, 4, 6]$. The answer is "YES" as you can choose the path to the vertex $u=2$. Then the vertex $4$ has distance $1$ to the vertex $1$ which belongs to this path and the vertex $6$ has distance $1$ to the vertex $2$ which belongs to this path.

The third query is $[2, 1, 5]$. The answer is "YES" as you can choose the path to the vertex $u=5$ and all vertices of the query belong to this path.

The fourth query is $[4, 8, 2]$. The answer is "YES" as you can choose the path to the vertex $u=9$ so vertices $2$ and $4$ both have distance $1$ to the vertex $1$ which belongs to this path and the vertex $8$ has distance $1$ to the vertex $7$ which belongs to this path.

The fifth and the sixth queries both have answer "NO" because you cannot choose suitable vertex $u$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to determine if there is a path from the root of a tree to a vertex $u$ such that all the given vertices are either on the path or have distance $1$ to some vertex on the path.

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The idea is to start from the root and explore the tree depth-first. For each vertex, we check if it is one of the given vertices or has distance $1$ to some vertex on the path. If we find a vertex that satisfies this condition, we can return "YES" immediately.

Here is a step-by-step description of the algorithm:

1. Initialize a boolean array `visited` of size $n$ to keep track of which vertices have been visited. Initialize all elements of `visited` to false.
2. Initialize a stack `s` to store the vertices to be explored. Push the root vertex onto `s`.
3. While `s` is not empty, pop a vertex `u` from `s`.

There are $n$ districts in the town, the $i$-th district belongs to the $a_i$-th bandit gang. Initially, no districts are connected to each other.

You are the mayor of the city and want to build $n-1$ two-way roads to connect all districts (two districts can be connected directly or through other connected districts).

If two districts belonging to the same gang are connected directly with a road, this gang will revolt.

You don't want this so your task is to build $n-1$ two-way roads in such a way that all districts are reachable from each other (possibly, using intermediate districts) and each pair of directly connected districts belong to different gangs, or determine that it is impossible to build $n-1$ roads to satisfy all the conditions.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 500$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 5000$) — the number of districts. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the gang the $i$-th district belongs to.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ does not exceed $5000$ ($\sum n \le 5000$).

For each test case, print:

  NO on the only line if it is impossible to connect all districts satisfying the conditions from the problem statement.  YES on the first line and $n-1$ roads on the next $n-1$ lines.

To solve this problem, we can use a graph algorithm called the "Ford-Fulkerson method" or "Edmonds-Karp algorithm". This algorithm is used to find the maximum flow in a flow network, which is a network of nodes and edges that represent the flow of resources between different parts of a system.

In our case, we can represent the districts as nodes in a graph, and the roads as edges between the nodes. Each edge has a capacity, which represents the maximum amount of flow that can pass through it. We can set the capacity of each edge to 1, since we want to build a two-way road between each pair of districts.

We can then use the Ford-Fulkerson method to find the maximum flow in the graph, which will give us the number of roads we need to build to connect all the districts. We can then use the result to determine whether it is possible

Note that you can swap the same pair of adjacent characters with indices $i$ and $i+1$ arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times. Each such swap is considered a separate move.

In this problem, we are given a binary string of length $n$ and we need to find the lexicographically minimum possible string that can be obtained from the given string by performing at most $k$ moves.

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

You are given $n$ segments on the coordinate axis $OX$. Segments can intersect, lie inside each other and even coincide. The $i$-th segment is $[l_i; r_i]$ ($l_i \le r_i$) and it covers all integer points $j$ such that $l_i \le j \le r_i$.

The integer point is called bad if it is covered by strictly more than $k$ segments.

Your task is to remove the minimum number of segments so that there are no bad points at all.

This problem can be solved using a combination of greedy and dynamic programming techniques.

The first step is to sort the segments by their right endpoints. This can be done in O(n log n) time using a sorting algorithm like quicksort.

Next, we can use a greedy algorithm to remove segments one by one. At each step, we remove the segment that covers the most points. We can do this in O(n) time by keeping track of the number of points covered by each segment and removing the segment that covers the most points.

However, this greedy algorithm may not always produce the optimal solution. For example, consider the following input:

2 1
1 2
2 3

The optimal solution is to remove the first segment, but the greedy algorithm will remove the second segment instead.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array dp of size n x n, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of segments we need to remove to make sure that there are no bad points between segments i and j (inclusive). We can initialize dp[i][i] =

We can then use the following recurrence relation to update dp:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + |x_i - x_k| + |x_k - x_j|)

where k is any point between i and j.

We can then calculate the sum of the minimum distances by summing up all the elements in the dp array.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n^3), and

You are given a weighted tree consisting of $n$ vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected graph without cycles. Vertices $u_i$ and $v_i$ are connected by an edge with weight $w_i$.

You are given $m$ queries. The $i$-th query is given as an integer $q_i$. In this query you need to calculate the number of pairs of vertices $(u, v)$ ($u < v$) such that the maximum weight of an edge on a simple path between $u$ and $v$ doesn't exceed $q_i$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries.

Each of the next $n - 1$ lines describes an edge of the tree. Edge $i$ is denoted by three integers $u_i$, $v_i$ and $w_i$ — the labels of vertices it connects ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $u_i \ne v_i$) and the weight of the edge ($1 \le w_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$). It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

The last line of the input contains $m$ integers $q_1, q_2, \dots, q_m$ ($1 \le q_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $q_i$ is the maximum weight of an edge in the $i$-th query.


-----Output-----

Print $m$ integers — the answers to the queries. The $i$-th value should be equal to the number of pairs of vertices $(u, v)$ ($u < v$) such that the maximum weight of an edge on a simple path between $u$ and $v$ doesn't exceed $q_i$.

Queries are numbered from $1$ to $m$ in the order of the input.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of pairs of vertices (u, v) such that the maximum weight of an edge on a simple path between u and v does not exceed q_i.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can use a 2D array dp[i][j] to store the number of pairs of vertices (u, v) such that the maximum weight of an edge on a simple path between u and v does not exceed j.

We can initialize dp[i][j] as 0 for all i and j. Then, for each query q_i, we can calculate the number of pairs of vertices (u, v) such that the maximum weight of an edge on a simple path between u and v does not exceed j as follows:

dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - w_i]

This is because we can either choose to include the edge (u_i, v_i) in the simple path, or we can choose not to include it. If we choose to include the edge, then the maximum weight of an edge

You are given the array $a$ consisting of $n$ positive (greater than zero) integers.

In one move, you can choose two indices $i$ and $j$ ($i \ne j$) such that the absolute difference between $a_i$ and $a_j$ is no more than one ($|a_i - a_j| \le 1$) and remove the smallest of these two elements. If two elements are equal, you can remove any of them (but exactly one).

Your task is to find if it is possible to obtain the array consisting of only one element using several (possibly, zero) such moves or not.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 50$) — the length of $a$. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer: "YES" if it is possible to obtain the array consisting of only one element using several (possibly, zero) moves described in the problem statement, or "NO" otherwise.

-----Note-----

In the first test case of the example, we can perform the following sequence of moves:  choose $i=1$ and $j=3$ and remove $a_i$ (so $a$ becomes $[2; 2]$);  choose $i=1$ and $j=2$ and remove $a_j$ (so $a$ becomes $[2]$). 

In the second test case of the example, we can choose any possible $i$ and $j$ any move and it doesn't matter which element we remove.

In the third test case of the example, there is no way to get rid of $2$ and $4$.

-----Plan-----
In this problem, we are given an array $a$ of positive integers and we need to determine if it is possible to obtain a single element by performing a series of moves.

The moves are as follows:

1. Choose two indices $i$ and $j$ such that the absolute difference between $a_i$ and $a_j$ is no more than one.
2. Remove the smallest of these two elements.
3. If two elements are equal, we can remove any of them (but exactly one).

The goal is to find if it is possible to obtain the array consisting of only one element using several (possibly, zero) such moves or not.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by removing the smallest element from the array. If the array consists of only one element, we are done. Otherwise, we can repeat the following steps:

1. Choose two indices $i$ and $j$ such that the absolute difference between $a_i$ and $a_j$ is no more than one.
2. Remove the smallest of these two elements.

You are given two huge binary integer numbers $a$ and $b$ of lengths $n$ and $m$ respectively. You will repeat the following process: if $b > 0$, then add to the answer the value $a~ \&~ b$ and divide $b$ by $2$ rounding down (i.e. remove the last digit of $b$), and repeat the process again, otherwise stop the process.

The value $a~ \&~ b$ means bitwise AND of $a$ and $b$. Your task is to calculate the answer modulo $998244353$.

Note that you should add the value $a~ \&~ b$ to the answer in decimal notation, not in binary. So your task is to calculate the answer in decimal notation. For example, if $a = 1010_2~ (10_{10})$ and $b = 1000_2~ (8_{10})$, then the value $a~ \&~ b$ will be equal to $8$, not to $1000$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of $a$ and the length of $b$ correspondingly.

The second line of the input contains one huge integer $a$. It is guaranteed that this number consists of exactly $n$ zeroes and ones and the first digit is always $1$.

The third line of the input contains one huge integer $b$. It is guaranteed that this number consists of exactly $m$ zeroes and ones and the first digit is always $1$.

-----Note-----

The algorithm for the first example:   add to the answer $1010_2~ \&~ 1101_2 = 1000_2 = 8_{10}$ and set $b := 110$;  add to the answer $1010_2~ \&~ 110_2 = 10_2 = 2_{10}$ and set $b := 11$;  add to the answer $1010_2~ \&~ 11_2 = 10_2 = 2_{10}$ and set $b := 1$;  add to the answer $1010_2~ \&~ 1_2 = 0_2 = 0_{10}$ and set $b := 0$. 

So the answer is $8 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 12$.

The algorithm for the second example:   add to the answer $1001_2~ \&~ 10101_2 = 1_2 = 1_{10}$ and set $b := 1010$;  add to the answer $1001_2~ \&~ 1010_2 = 1000_2 = 8_{10}$ and set $b := 101$;  add to the answer $1001_2~ \&~ 101_2 = 1_2 = 1_{10}$ and set $b := 10$;  add to the answer $1001_2~ \&~ 10_2 = 0_2 = 0_{10}$ and set $b := 1$;  add to the answer $1001_2~ \&~ 1_2 = 1_2 = 1_{10}$ and set $b := 0$. 

So the answer is $1 + 8 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 11$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the bitwise AND of two large binary integers, $a$ and $b$, and then find the remainder of the result when divided by 998244353. The problem can be solved by repeatedly applying the following steps:

1. If $b$ is greater than 0, then find the bitwise AND of $a$ and $b$, and add the result to the answer.
2. Divide $b$ by 2, rounding down, and set $b$ to the result.
3. Repeat step 1 until $b$ is 0.

The answer is the final result of the above steps.

For example, if $a = 1010$ and $b = 1001$, then the bitwise AND of $a$ and $b$ is $1000$, which is added to the answer. Then $b$ is divided by 2, rounding down, and set to $101$. The bitwise AND of $a$ and $b$ is $101$, which is added to the answer. Then $b$ is divided by 2,

To solve this problem, we need to construct an array $a$ of length $n$ such that the first $\frac{n}{2}$ elements are even, the second $\frac{n}{2}$ elements are odd, all elements are distinct and positive, and the sum of the first half equals the sum of the second half.

We can start by constructing the first $\frac{n}{2}$ elements of $a$ as even numbers from $2$ to $n$. We can then construct the second $\frac{n}{2}$ elements of $a$ as odd numbers from $1$ to $n$.

To ensure that all elements of $a$ are distinct and positive, we can use the fact that the sum of the first half equals the sum of the second half. We can use this to our advantage by ensuring that the sum of the first half is equal to the sum of the second half minus $1$. This will ensure that all elements of $a$ are distinct and positive.

For example, if $n = 6$, we can construct the array $a$ as follows:

Pay attention to the non-standard memory limit in this problem.

In order to cut off efficient solutions from inefficient ones in this problem, the time limit is rather strict. Prefer to use compiled statically typed languages (e.g. C++). If you use Python, then submit solutions on PyPy. Try to write an efficient solution.

The array $a=[a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) is given. Its element $a_i$ is called special if there exists a pair of indices $l$ and $r$ ($1 \le l < r \le n$) such that $a_i = a_l + a_{l+1} + \ldots + a_r$. In other words, an element is called special if it can be represented as the sum of two or more consecutive elements of an array (no matter if they are special or not).

Print the number of special elements of the given array $a$.

For example, if $n=9$ and $a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5]$, then the answer is $5$:  $a_3=4$ is a special element, since $a_3=4=a_1+a_2=3+1$;  $a_5=5$ is a special element, since $a_5=5=a_2+a_3=1+4$;  $a_6=9$ is a special element, since $a_6=9=a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4=3+1+4+1$;  $a_8=6$ is a special element, since $a_8=6=a_2+a_3+a_4=1+4+1$;  $a_9=5$ is a special element, since $a_9=5=a_2+a_3=1+4$. 

Please note that some of the elements of the array $a$ may be equal — if several elements are equal and special, then all of them should be counted in the answer.

The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.

Each test case is given in two lines. The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 8000$) — the length of the array $a$. The second line contains integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$).

This problem is asking us to find the number of special elements in an array. A special element is defined as an element that can be represented as the sum of two or more consecutive elements of an array.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can iterate through the array and for each element, we can check if it is equal to the sum of two or more consecutive elements. If it is, then we can count it as a special element.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Read the input: The first line of the input contains the number of test cases (t). Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the length of the array (n). The second line contains the elements of the array.
2. Initialize the count: Initialize a variable to store the number of special elements.
3. Iterate through the array: Iterate through the array and for each element, we can check if it is equal to the sum of two or more consecutive elements.
4. Check if the element is special: If the element is equal to the sum of two or more consecutive elements, then we can count it as a special element.

You are given $n$ segments on a coordinate axis $OX$. The $i$-th segment has borders $[l_i; r_i]$. All points $x$, for which $l_i \le x \le r_i$ holds, belong to the $i$-th segment.

Your task is to choose the maximum by size (the number of segments) subset of the given set of segments such that each pair of segments in this subset either non-intersecting or one of them lies inside the other one.

Two segments $[l_i; r_i]$ and $[l_j; r_j]$ are non-intersecting if they have no common points. For example, segments $[1; 2]$ and $[3; 4]$, $[1; 3]$ and $[5; 5]$ are non-intersecting, while segments $[1; 2]$ and $[2; 3]$, $[1; 2]$ and $[2; 2]$ are intersecting.

The segment $[l_i; r_i]$ lies inside the segment $[l_j; r_j]$ if $l_j \le l_i$ and $r_i \le r_j$. For example, segments $[2; 2]$, $[2, 3]$, $[3; 4]$ and $[2; 4]$ lie inside the segment $[2; 4]$, while $[2; 5]$ and $[1; 4]$ are not.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by selecting the first segment in the given set of segments. Then, we can select the next segment that either non-intersects with the current selected segment or lies inside the current selected segment. We continue this process until we have selected all the segments.

The key observation is that if we select a segment that non-intersects with the current selected segment, then we can safely select the next segment without any intersection. However, if we select a segment that lies inside the current selected segment, then we need to check if the next segment non-intersects with the current selected segment. If it does, then we can safely select the next segment. If it doesn't, then we need to check if the next segment lies inside the current selected segment. If it does, then we can safely select the next segment. If it doesn't

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of minutes between the current time and the time of the New Year.

First, we need to convert the current time to minutes. We can do this by multiplying the number of hours by 60 and adding the number of minutes. For example, if the current time is 23:55, we can convert it to minutes by multiplying 23 by 60 and adding 55, which gives us 1455 minutes.

Next, we need to find the number of minutes until the New Year. We can do this by subtracting the number of minutes from the current time from the number of minutes in a day. For example, if the current time is 23:55, and there are 1440 minutes in a day, we can find the number of minutes until the New Year by subtracting 1455 from 1440, which gives us 85 minutes.

Finally, we need to print the answer for each test case. We can do this by printing the number of minutes until the New Year for each test case.

There is a robot on a coordinate plane. Initially, the robot is located at the point $(0, 0)$. Its path is described as a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of characters 'L', 'R', 'U', 'D'.

Each of these characters corresponds to some move:   'L' (left): means that the robot moves from the point $(x, y)$ to the point $(x - 1, y)$;  'R' (right): means that the robot moves from the point $(x, y)$ to the point $(x + 1, y)$;  'U' (up): means that the robot moves from the point $(x, y)$ to the point $(x, y + 1)$;  'D' (down): means that the robot moves from the point $(x, y)$ to the point $(x, y - 1)$. 

The company that created this robot asked you to optimize the path of the robot somehow. To do this, you can remove any non-empty substring of the path. But this company doesn't want their customers to notice the change in the robot behavior. It means that if before the optimization the robot ended its path at the point $(x_e, y_e)$, then after optimization (i.e. removing some single substring from $s$) the robot also ends its path at the point $(x_e, y_e)$.

This optimization is a low-budget project so you need to remove the shortest possible non-empty substring to optimize the robot's path such that the endpoint of his path doesn't change. It is possible that you can't optimize the path. Also, it is possible that after the optimization the target path is an empty string (i.e. deleted substring is the whole string $s$).

Recall that the substring of $s$ is such string that can be obtained from $s$ by removing some amount of characters (possibly, zero) from the prefix and some amount of characters (possibly, zero) from the suffix. For example, the substrings of "LURLLR" are "LU", "LR", "LURLLR", "URL", but not "RR" and "UL".

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases.

The next $2t$ lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on two lines. The first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of the robot's path. The second line of the test case contains one string $s$ consisting of $n$ characters 'L', 'R', 'U', 'D' — the robot's path.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$ ($\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer on it. If you cannot remove such non-empty substring that the endpoint of the robot's path doesn't change, print -1. Otherwise, print two integers $l$ and $r$ such that $1 \le l \le r \le n$ — endpoints of the substring you remove. The value $r-l+1$ should be minimum possible. If there are several answers, print any of them.

In this problem, we are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D'. The task is to find the shortest non-empty substring of $s$ such that removing this substring does not change the endpoint of the robot's path.

Let's consider a few examples to understand the problem better:

* If the string is "LRUD", the shortest non-empty substring that does not change the endpoint of the robot's path is "L".
* If the string is "LURD", the shortest non-empty substring that does not change the endpoint of the robot's path is "U".
* If the string is "RRUDU", the shortest non-empty substring that does not change the endpoint of the robot's path is "R".

Now, let's try to find the shortest non-empty substring that does not change the endpoint of the robot's path for a given string $s$. We can start by finding the first occurrence of a character that is not 'L' or 'R'. If we find such a character, we can remove the substring starting from that

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
You have $n$ students under your control and you have to compose exactly two teams consisting of some subset of your students. Each student had his own skill, the $i$-th student skill is denoted by an integer $a_i$ (different students can have the same skills).

So, about the teams. Firstly, these two teams should have the same size. Two more constraints:  The first team should consist of students with distinct skills (i.e. all skills in the first team are unique).  The second team should consist of students with the same skills (i.e. all skills in the second team are equal). 

Note that it is permissible that some student of the first team has the same skill as a student of the second team.

Consider some examples (skills are given):  $[1, 2, 3]$, $[4, 4]$ is not a good pair of teams because sizes should be the same;  $[1, 1, 2]$, $[3, 3, 3]$ is not a good pair of teams because the first team should not contain students with the same skills;  $[1, 2, 3]$, $[3, 4, 4]$ is not a good pair of teams because the second team should contain students with the same skills;  $[1, 2, 3]$, $[3, 3, 3]$ is a good pair of teams;  $[5]$, $[6]$ is a good pair of teams. 

Your task is to find the maximum possible size $x$ for which it is possible to compose a valid pair of teams, where each team size is $x$ (skills in the first team needed to be unique, skills in the second team should be the same between them). A student cannot be part of more than one team.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of students. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$), where $a_i$ is the skill of the $i$-th student. Different students can have the same skills.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$ ($\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer — the maximum possible size $x$ for which it is possible to compose a valid pair of teams, where each team size is $x$.

-----Note-----

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to construct two teams of size $3$: the first team is $[1, 2, 4]$ and the second team is $[4, 4, 4]$. Note, that there are some other ways to construct two valid teams of size $3$.

-----Plan-----
In this problem, we are given a set of $n$ students, each with a unique skill $a_i$ (where $1 \leq a_i \leq n$). We need to find the maximum size $x$ such that we can form two teams of size $x$, where each team has the same skill (i.e., all students in the same team have the same skill).

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by selecting the student with the highest skill $a_i$ and adding them to one of the teams. We can then select the next student with the highest skill $a_j$ and add them to the other team. We continue this process until we have selected all $n$ students.

The key insight here is that we can always find a valid pair of teams of size $x$ by selecting the $x$ students with the highest skills first. This is because we can always find a team of size $x$ with the same skill by selecting the $x$ students with the highest skills and then adding the remaining students to the other team.

Therefore, the maximum size $x$ for which we can form a valid pair

You are given a tree consisting exactly of $n$ vertices. Tree is a connected undirected graph with $n-1$ edges. Each vertex $v$ of this tree has a value $a_v$ assigned to it.

Let $dist(x, y)$ be the distance between the vertices $x$ and $y$. The distance between the vertices is the number of edges on the simple path between them.

Let's define the cost of the tree as the following value: firstly, let's fix some vertex of the tree. Let it be $v$. Then the cost of the tree is $\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} dist(i, v) \cdot a_i$.

Your task is to calculate the maximum possible cost of the tree if you can choose $v$ arbitrarily.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$, the number of vertices in the tree ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the value of the vertex $i$.

Each of the next $n - 1$ lines describes an edge of the tree. Edge $i$ is denoted by two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$, the labels of vertices it connects ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $u_i \ne v_i$).

It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the maximum possible cost of the tree if you can choose any vertex as $v$.

Picture corresponding to the first example: [Image]

You can choose the vertex $3$ as a root, then the answer will be $2 \cdot 9 + 1 \cdot 4 + 0 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 7 + 3 \cdot 10 + 4 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 6 + 4 \cdot 5 = 18 + 4 + 0 + 21 + 30 + 4 + 24 + 20 = 121$.

In the second example tree consists only of one vertex so the answer is always $0$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum possible cost of a tree with $n$ vertices, where each vertex has a value $a_v$ assigned to it. The cost of the tree is the sum of the distances between each vertex and the chosen vertex $v$, multiplied by the value of the vertex. The goal is to find the maximum possible cost of the tree if we can choose $v$ arbitrarily.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can define a function $f(v, i)$ that represents the maximum possible cost of the tree with $i$ vertices, where $v$ is the chosen vertex. We can calculate $f(v, i)$ as follows:

* If $i = 1$, then $f(v, 1) = 0$, since there is only one vertex in the tree, and we can't choose any other vertex as $v$.
* If $i > 1$, then we can choose any vertex $u$ as $v$, and the cost of the tree is the maximum of the following two cases:
	+ The cost of the tree with $i - 1$ vertices, where $u$ is the chosen vertex

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ positive integers.

Initially, you have an integer $x = 0$. During one move, you can do one of the following two operations:  Choose exactly one $i$ from $1$ to $n$ and increase $a_i$ by $x$ ($a_i := a_i + x$), then increase $x$ by $1$ ($x := x + 1$).  Just increase $x$ by $1$ ($x := x + 1$). 

The first operation can be applied no more than once to each $i$ from $1$ to $n$.

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain such an array that each its element is divisible by $k$ (the value $k$ is given).

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5; 1 \le k \le 10^9$) — the length of $a$ and the required divisior. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$ ($\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).

For each test case, print the answer — the minimum number of moves required to obtain such an array that each its element is divisible by $k$.

Consider the first test case of the example:  $x=0$, $a = [1, 2, 1, 3]$. Just increase $x$;  $x=1$, $a = [1, 2, 1, 3]$. Add $x$ to the second element and increase $x$;  $x=2$, $a = [1, 3, 1, 3]$. Add $x$ to the third element and increase $x$;  $x=3$, $a = [1, 3, 3, 3]$. Add $x$ to the fourth element and increase $x$;  $x=4$, $a = [1, 3, 3, 6]$. Just increase $x$;  $x=5$, $a = [1, 3, 3, 6]$. Add $x$ to the first element and increase $x$;  $x=6$, $a = [6, 3, 3, 6]$. We obtained the required array. 

Note that you can't add $x$ to the same element more than once.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain an array where each element is divisible by $k$.

We can start by considering the first element of the array. If it is already divisible by $k$, we can simply increase the value of $x$ by $1$ and repeat the process for the remaining elements.

If the first element is not divisible by $k$, we need to find the smallest integer $i$ such that $a_i$ is divisible by $k$. We can do this by checking each element of the array and finding the smallest element that is divisible by $k$. Once we have found the smallest element, we can add $x$ to that element and increase $x$ by $1$.

We can repeat this process for the remaining elements of the array. If we need to add $x$ to an element that is not divisible by $k$, we can find the smallest integer $i$ such that $a_i$ is divisible by $k$ and add $x$ to that element.

Once we have processed all the elements of the array, we can simply increase $x$ by $1$

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.


Note:
You may assume the greed factor is always positive. 
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.


Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]

Output: 1

Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.



Example 2:

Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.

-----Plan-----
This problem is a classic example of a greedy algorithm. The goal is to assign cookies to children in a way that maximizes the number of content children.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start by considering the first child. We have a cookie and the greed factor of the first child is 1. Since the size of the cookie is 1, we can assign the cookie to the first child and make them content.

Next, we consider the second child. We have two cookies and the greed factor of the second child is 2. Since the size of the first cookie is 1, we cannot assign it to the second child. However, we have a second cookie with a size of 2, which is greater than the greed factor of the second child. We can assign this cookie to the second child and make them content.

Now, we consider the third child. We have two cookies and the greed factor of the third child is 3. Since the size of the first cookie is 1, we cannot assign it to the third child. However, we have a second cookie with a size of 2, which is less than the greed factor of the

Given a non-negative index k where k ≤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.

Note that the row index starts from 0.


In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Example:


Input: 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]


Follow up:

Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can start by defining the first row of the Pascal's triangle as [1].

For each subsequent row, we can calculate the next row by adding the previous row and the row above it. For example, the second row of the Pascal's triangle is [1, 1, 1], which is calculated by adding [1] and [1, 1].

We can continue this process until we reach the kth row. Once we have the kth row, we can return it.

To optimize the space complexity, we can use a single variable to store the previous row and the row above it. This way, we only need to store two values instead of the entire row.

For example, if we are calculating the 10th row of the Pascal's triangle, we can use a single variable to store the 9th row and the 8th row. This way, we only need to store two values instead of the entire 10th row.

Overall, the time complexity of this solution is O(k), and the space complexity is O(1).

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Note:

Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer -3.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.

Example 2:
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.

Example 3:
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
 

Constraints:

The input must be a binary string of length 32.
 
Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we can use a bitwise operation to count the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of the input integer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Convert the input integer to a binary string.
2. Use a bitwise AND operation with the input integer and a mask that has all the bits set to 1, except for the most significant bit. This will clear all the bits except for the most significant bit.
3. Repeat step 2 until the result is 0.
4. The number of times the bitwise AND operation is performed is equal to the number of '1' bits in the input integer.

Here's an example of how this solution would work:

Suppose we have the input integer 10 (in binary, this is 1010).

1. Convert the input integer to a binary string: 1010
2. Use a bitwise AND operation with the input integer and a mask that has all the bits set to 1, except for the most significant bit: 1010 & 111111111

Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, plus one to the integer.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contain a single digit.

You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:


Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.


Example 2:


Input: [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to add 1 to the integer represented by the array of digits. We can do this by iterating through the array from the last digit to the first digit, and incrementing the digit at each position by 1 if it is less than 9. If the digit is 9, we set it to 0 and carry a 1 to the next digit. We repeat this process until we reach the first digit, and if the first digit is 9, we set it to 0 and carry a 1 to the next digit.

For example, let's say we have the array [1, 2, 3]. We start by incrementing the digit at the last position, which is 3. Since 3 is less than 9, we set it to 4 and carry a 0 to the next position. The array now looks like [1, 2, 4].

Next, we move to the second-to-last position, which is 2. Since 2 is less than 9, we set it to 3 and carry a 1 to the next position. The array now looks like [1, 3, 4].

We have N points in the two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th point are (X_i,Y_i).
Among them, we are looking for the points such that the distance from the origin is at most D. How many such points are there?
We remind you that the distance between the origin and the point (p, q) can be represented as \sqrt{p^2+q^2}.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 2\times 10^5
 - 0 \leq D \leq 2\times 10^5
 - |X_i|,|Y_i| \leq 2\times 10^5
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N D

Print an integer representing the number of points such that the distance from the origin is at most D.

-----Sample Input-----
4 5
0 5
-2 4
3 4
4 -4

-----Sample Output-----

The distance between the origin and each of the given points is as follows:
 - \sqrt{0^2+5^2}=5
 - \sqrt{(-2)^2+4^2}=4.472\ldots
 - \sqrt{3^2+4^2}=5
 - \sqrt{4^2+(-4)^2}=5.656\ldots
Thus, we have three points such that the distance from the origin is at most 5.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of points in a two-dimensional plane with coordinates (X_i, Y_i) such that the distance from the origin (0, 0) is at most D.

To solve this problem, we can use the distance formula, which is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of the coordinates. In this case, the distance from the origin to a point (X_i, Y_i) is given by:

\sqrt{X_i^2 + Y_i^2}

We can use this formula to find the distance from the origin to each of the N points, and then count the number of points that have a distance less than or equal to D.

To do this, we can first calculate the distance from the origin to each point, and then use a loop to count the number of points that have a distance less than or equal to D.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Python:

1. Read the input N from Standard Input.
2. Calculate f(N) by adding up the digits in N when written in base 10. For example, if N = 12, then f(N) = 1 + 2 = 3.

However, something came up just before the trip, and you no longer have enough time to visit all the N spots, so you decided to choose some i and cancel the visit to Spot i.
You will visit the remaining spots as planned in the order they are numbered.
You will also depart from and return to the point with coordinate 0 at the beginning and the end, as planned.
For each i = 1, 2, ..., N, find the total cost of travel during the trip when the visit to Spot i is canceled.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - -5000 \leq A_i \leq 5000 (1 \leq i \leq N)
 - All input values are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

-----Output-----
Print N lines.
In the i-th line, print the total cost of travel during the trip when the visit to Spot i is canceled.

-----Sample Input-----

3 5 -1

-----Sample Output-----
12

10

Spot 1, 2 and 3 are at the points with coordinates 3, 5 and -1, respectively.
For each i, the course of the trip and the total cost of travel when the visit to Spot i is canceled, are as follows:
 - For i = 1, the course of the trip is 0 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow -1 \rightarrow 0 and the total cost of travel is 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 yen.
 - For i = 2, the course of the trip is 0 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow -1 \rightarrow 0 and the total cost of travel is 3 + 4 + 1 = 8 yen.
 - For i = 3, the course of the trip is 0 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 0 and the total cost of travel is 3 + 2 + 5 = 10 yen.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the total cost of travel during the trip when the visit to a specific spot is canceled. We are given the coordinates of N sightseeing spots on the x-axis, and the cost of traveling from one spot to another. We are also given the order in which we will visit the spots.

To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of travel for each spot when the visit to that spot is canceled. We can do this by considering the different possible courses of the trip and the cost of travel for each course.

Let's consider the course of the trip when the visit to Spot i is canceled. There are two possible courses:

1. The first course is 0 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow -1 \rightarrow 0, where we start at the point with coordinate 0, visit Spot 1 at the point with coordinate 5, visit Spot 2 at the point with coordinate -1, and return to the point with coordinate 0. The cost of travel for this course is 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 yen.
2. The second course is 0

-----Output-----
If c is a vowel, print vowel. Otherwise, print consonant.

-----Sample Input-----

To solve this problem, we need to check if the input character is one of the five vowels in the English alphabet. We can do this by using a series of if-else statements.

First, we need to check if the input character is 'a'. If it is, then we know that it is a vowel. We can print "vowel" and end the program.

If the input character is not 'a', then we need to check if it is 'e'. If it is, then we know that it is a vowel. We can print "vowel" and end the program.

If the input character is not 'a' or 'e', then we need to check if it is 'i'. If it is, then we know that it is a vowel. We can print "vowel" and end the program.

If the input character is not 'a', 'e', or 'i', then we need to check if it is 'o'. If it is, then we know that it is a vowel. We can print "vowel" and end the program.

Two foxes Jiro and Saburo are playing a game called 1D Reversi. This game is played on a board, using black and white stones. On the board, stones are placed in a row, and each player places a new stone to either end of the row. Similarly to the original game of Reversi, when a white stone is placed, all black stones between the new white stone and another white stone, turn into white stones, and vice versa.
In the middle of a game, something came up and Saburo has to leave the game. The state of the board at this point is described by a string S. There are |S| (the length of S) stones on the board, and each character in S represents the color of the i-th (1 ≦ i ≦ |S|) stone from the left. If the i-th character in S is B, it means that the color of the corresponding stone on the board is black. Similarly, if the i-th character in S is W, it means that the color of the corresponding stone is white.
Jiro wants all stones on the board to be of the same color. For this purpose, he will place new stones on the board according to the rules. Find the minimum number of new stones that he needs to place.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 ≦ |S| ≦ 10^5
 - Each character in S is B or W.

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
Print the minimum number of new stones that Jiro needs to place for his purpose.

-----Sample Input-----
BBBWW

-----Sample Output-----
1

By placing a new black stone to the right end of the row of stones, all white stones will become black. Also, by placing a new white stone to the left end of the row of stones, all black stones will become white.
In either way, Jiro's purpose can be achieved by placing one stone.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of new stones that Jiro needs to place on the board to convert all the stones to the same color.

Let's consider the case where Jiro places a new black stone to the right end of the row of stones. In this case, all the white stones between the new black stone and the next white stone will become black. Therefore, we can convert all the white stones to black by placing a new black stone to the right end of the row.

Similarly, if Jiro places a new white stone to the left end of the row of stones, all the black stones between the new white stone and the next black stone will become white. Therefore, we can convert all the black stones to white by placing a new white stone to the left end of the row.

In either case, we can achieve Jiro's purpose by placing one stone. Therefore, the minimum number of new stones that Jiro needs to place is 1.

Therefore, the output is 1.

AtCoDeer the deer has found two positive integers, a and b.

 - a and b are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
a b

-----Output-----
If the concatenation of a and b in this order is a square number, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
1 21

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

As 121 = 11 × 11, it is a square number.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to determine whether the concatenation of a and b in this order is a square number.

First, we need to convert the input a and b into a string. We can do this by concatenating the two integers into a single string.

Next, we need to calculate the square of the concatenated string. We can do this by taking the length of the string and squaring it.

For example, if a = 1 and b = 21, the concatenated string would be "121". The length of this string is 3, so the square of the concatenated string would be 3^2 = 9.

Finally, we need to compare the square of the concatenated string to the original integers a and b. If the square of the concatenated string is equal to a or b, then we know that the concatenation of a and b in this order is a square number.

If the concatenation of a and b in this order is a square number, we print "Yes". Otherwise, we print "No".

In the sample input, the concatenated string is "121", which has a length of

You are given an integer sequence of length N, a_1,a_2,...,a_N.
For each 1≤i≤N, you have three choices: add 1 to a_i, subtract 1 from a_i or do nothing.
After these operations, you select an integer X and count the number of i such that a_i=X.
Maximize this count by making optimal choices.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1≤N≤10^5
 - 0≤a_i<10^5 (1≤i≤N)
 - a_i is an integer.

-----Input-----

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible number of i such that a_i=X.

-----Sample Input-----
7
3 1 4 1 5 9 2

-----Sample Output-----
4

For example, turn the sequence into 2,2,3,2,6,9,2 and select X=2 to obtain 4, the maximum possible count.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum number of indices i such that a_i = X, where X is a given integer. The goal is to maximize the count by making optimal choices.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array dp of size N x X, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of indices i such that a_i = j.

We can fill the dp array in the following way:

* dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + 1 if a_i = j
* dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1]) if a_i!= j

The base case is dp[0][j] = 1 if a_0 = j, 0 otherwise.

The answer is the maximum value in the dp array.

The time complexity of this solution is O(NX), where N is the length of the input sequence and X is the value of X. The space complexity is O(NX).

There are nine squares in a 3 \times 3 square grid.
Four of them will be painted white, so the remaining five squares will be painted black.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking how many squares will be painted black if we paint exactly A squares white in an N x N square grid.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of black squares in the grid.

We can do this by counting the number of black squares in each row and column.

Let's say we have an N x N square grid with N rows and N columns.

If we paint exactly A squares white, we can divide the number of squares in each row and column by 2 to find the number of black squares in each row and column.

For example, if we have a 3 x 3 square grid with 4 white squares, we can divide the number of squares in each row and column by 2 to find the number of black squares in each row and column.

Row 1: 3 / 2 = 1.5 black squares
Row 2: 3 / 2 = 1.5 black squares
Row 3: 3 / 2 = 1.5 black squares

-----Output-----
Print YES if the arrangement of the poles is beautiful; print NO otherwise.

-----Sample Input-----

Since 4-2 = 6-4, this arrangement of poles is beautiful.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to determine whether the arrangement of three poles is beautiful. A beautiful arrangement is defined as when the tops of the poles lie on the same line.

To solve this problem, we need to check if the difference between the heights of the two poles on the left side of the line is equal to the difference between the heights of the two poles on the right side of the line.

We can do this by checking if b-a = c-b. If this is true, then the arrangement of the poles is beautiful. Otherwise, it is not.

So, the solution is to check if b-a = c-b. If it is true, then print YES, otherwise print NO.

The one's digit of 29 is 9.

To solve this problem, we need to check if the digit 9 appears in the decimal notation of N.

We can start by converting N to a string. We can do this by using the `str()` function in Python.

Next, we can use the `in` operator to check if the digit 9 appears in the string representation of N.

If the digit 9 appears in the string representation of N, we print "Yes". Otherwise, we print "No".

Here's the code:

n = int(input())

if str(n).find("9")!= -1:

In this code, we first take input from the user and store it in the variable `n`.

We then convert `n` to a string using the `str()` function.

Next, we use the `in` operator to check if the digit 9 appears in the string representation of `n`. If it does, we print "Yes". Otherwise, we print "No".

There are N + 1 squares arranged in a row, numbered 0, 1, ..., N from left to right.
Initially, you are in Square X.
You can freely travel between adjacent squares. Your goal is to reach Square 0 or Square N.
However, for each i = 1, 2, ..., M, there is a toll gate in Square A_i, and traveling to Square A_i incurs a cost of 1.
It is guaranteed that there is no toll gate in Square 0, Square X and Square N.
Find the minimum cost incurred before reaching the goal.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 100
 - 1 \leq M \leq 100
 - 1 \leq X \leq N - 1
 - 1 \leq A_1 < A_2 < ... < A_M \leq N

-----Output-----
Print the minimum cost incurred before reaching the goal.

-----Sample Input-----

The optimal solution is as follows:
 - First, travel from Square 3 to Square 4. Here, there is a toll gate in Square 4, so the cost of 1 is incurred.
 - Then, travel from Square 4 to Square 5. This time, no cost is incurred.
 - Now, we are in Square 5 and we have reached the goal.
In this case, the total cost incurred is 1.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum cost incurred before reaching Square 0 or Square N. The solution is to travel from Square X to Square 0 or Square N, and then travel to the other square.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Start at Square X.
2. Travel to Square A_1, which is the first toll gate. The cost of 1 is incurred.
3. Travel to Square A_2, which is the second toll gate. The cost of 1 is incurred.
4. Travel to Square A_3, which is the third toll gate. The cost of 1 is incurred.
5. Continue this process until you reach Square 0 or Square N.
6. If you reach Square 0, the total cost incurred is 3 (1 + 1 + 1). If you reach Square N, the total cost incurred is 3 (1 + 1 + 1).

The optimal solution is to travel from Square X to Square 0 or Square N, and then travel to the other square. This solution

We have a canvas divided into a grid with H rows and W columns. The square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left is represented as (i, j).

Initially, all the squares are white. square1001 wants to draw a picture with black paint. His specific objective is to make Square (i, j) black when s_{i, j}= #, and to make Square (i, j) white when s_{i, j}= ..

However, since he is not a good painter, he can only choose two squares that are horizontally or vertically adjacent and paint those squares black, for some number of times (possibly zero). He may choose squares that are already painted black, in which case the color of those squares remain black.

Each of the five weekdays is divided into two periods, the morning and the evening. For each of those ten periods, a shop must be either open during the whole period, or closed during the whole period. Naturally, a shop must be open during at least one of those periods.
There are already N stores in the street, numbered 1 through N.
You are given information of the business hours of those shops, F_{i,j,k}. If F_{i,j,k}=1, Shop i is open during Period k on Day j (this notation is explained below); if F_{i,j,k}=0, Shop i is closed during that period. Here, the days of the week are denoted as follows.

* The next N lines contain the information about the business hours of each shop. Each line contains 10 integers, where the first 5 integers represent the business hours of the shop during the morning and the last 5 integers represent the business hours of the shop during the afternoon.
* The next N lines contain the profit of each shop.

The problem is asking us to find the maximum possible profit that Joisino can make from opening her shop during different periods of the day. The problem is a classic example of a scheduling problem, where we need to find the optimal schedule for opening the shop.

The solution to this problem is to find the optimal schedule for opening the shop, such that the profit is maximized. The optimal schedule can be found by solving a linear programming problem, where we need to maximize the profit

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
The postal code in Atcoder Kingdom is A+B+1 characters long, its (A+1)-th character is a hyphen -, and the other characters are digits from 0 through 9.
You are given a string S. Determine whether it follows the postal code format in Atcoder Kingdom.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1≤A,B≤5
 - |S|=A+B+1
 - S consists of - and digits from 0 through 9.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B
S

-----Output-----
Print Yes if S follows the postal code format in AtCoder Kingdom; print No otherwise.

-----Sample Input-----
3 4
269-6650

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

The (A+1)-th character of S is -, and the other characters are digits from 0 through 9, so it follows the format.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to determine whether a given string S follows the postal code format in Atcoder Kingdom. The format is as follows:

* The postal code in Atcoder Kingdom is A+B+1 characters long.
* The (A+1)-th character is a hyphen -.
* The other characters are digits from 0 through 9.

To solve this problem, you need to check if the given string S follows this format. You can do this by checking the length of S, the first character, and the remaining characters.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Check the length of S. If it is not equal to A+B+1, then it does not follow the format.
2. Check the first character of S. If it is not a hyphen -, then it does not follow the format.
3. Check the remaining characters of S. If they are not all digits from 0 through 9, then it does not follow the format.

If all of these conditions are met, then S follows the postal code format in Atcoder Kingdom.

In summary, the solution is to check the length

AtCoDeer the deer found two rectangles lying on the table, each with height 1 and width W.
If we consider the surface of the desk as a two-dimensional plane, the first rectangle covers the vertical range of [0,1] and the horizontal range of [a,a+W], and the second rectangle covers the vertical range of [1,2] and the horizontal range of [b,b+W], as shown in the following figure:

AtCoDeer will move the second rectangle horizontally so that it connects with the first rectangle.
Find the minimum distance it needs to be moved.

-----Constraints-----
 - All input values are integers.
 - 1≤W≤10^5
 - 1≤a,b≤10^5

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
W a b

-----Output-----
Print the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved.

-----Sample Input-----
3 2 6

-----Sample Output-----
1

This input corresponds to the figure in the statement. In this case, the second rectangle should be moved to the left by a distance of 1.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved so that it connects with the first rectangle.

We can start by drawing the two rectangles on the table, as shown in the figure. We can see that the first rectangle covers the vertical range of [0,1] and the horizontal range of [a,a+W], while the second rectangle covers the vertical range of [1,2] and the horizontal range of [b,b+W].

We need to find the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved so that it connects with the first rectangle. We can do this by finding the minimum distance between the two rectangles.

Let's call the horizontal position of the second rectangle "x". We can see that the second rectangle needs to be moved to the left by a distance of x-b, and it needs to be moved to the right by a distance of a+W-x.

We want to find the minimum distance between the two rectangles, which is the minimum of the two distances. We can calculate these distances as follows:

Distance 1: x-b
Distance 2: a+W-x

 - 3 is the first smallest integer among the integers between 3 and 8.
 - 4 is the second smallest integer among the integers between 3 and 8.
 - 7 is the second largest integer among the integers between 3 and 8.
 - 8 is the first largest integer among the integers between 3 and 8.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find all the integers between A and B (inclusive) that are either within the K smallest integers or within the K largest integers.

To solve this problem, we can first find the K smallest and K largest integers between A and B. We can do this by sorting the integers between A and B in ascending order and then taking the first K integers as the smallest and the last K integers as the largest.

Once we have the smallest and largest integers, we can find all the integers that satisfy the condition by iterating through the integers between A and B and checking if they are either within the K smallest integers or within the K largest integers.

Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:

1. Read the input values A, B, and K from Standard Input.
2. Sort the integers between A and B in ascending order.
3. Take the first K integers as the smallest integers and the last K integers as the largest integers.

There are a total of A + B cats and dogs.
Among them, A are known to be cats, but the remaining B are not known to be either cats or dogs.
Determine if it is possible that there are exactly X cats among these A + B animals.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq A \leq 100
 - 1 \leq B \leq 100
 - 1 \leq X \leq 200
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B X

-----Output-----
If it is possible that there are exactly X cats, print YES; if it is impossible, print NO.

-----Sample Input-----
3 5 4

-----Sample Output-----
YES

If there are one cat and four dogs among the B = 5 animals, there are X = 4 cats in total.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking if it is possible that there are exactly X cats among the A + B animals, where A is the number of known cats and B is the number of unknown animals.

To solve this problem, we need to consider two cases:

Case 1: A = X
In this case, we know that there are X cats among the A + B animals, and we can easily verify that this is possible by checking that A + B = X + X = 2X.

Case 2: A < X
In this case, we know that there are fewer cats than X among the A + B animals. We can rule out this possibility by checking that A + B < X + X = 2X, which is not possible.

Therefore, the answer is YES if A = X, and NO otherwise.

We have a sandglass that runs for X seconds. The sand drops from the upper bulb at a rate of 1 gram per second. That is, the upper bulb initially contains X grams of sand.
How many grams of sand will the upper bulb contains after t seconds?

 - 1≤X≤10^9
 - 1≤t≤10^9
 - X and t are integers.

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X t

-----Output-----
Print the number of sand in the upper bulb after t second.

-----Sample Input-----
100 17

-----Sample Output-----
83

17 out of the initial 100 grams of sand will be consumed, resulting in 83 grams.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the number of grams of sand that will be left in the upper bulb after t seconds, where t is the number of seconds that the sandglass runs for.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of grams of sand that will be consumed by the sandglass during the first t seconds. We can do this by multiplying the rate of sand consumption (1 gram per second) by the number of seconds that the sandglass runs for (t).

So, the number of grams of sand that will be consumed by the sandglass during the first t seconds is:

1 gram per second x t seconds = t grams

Now, we need to subtract the number of grams of sand that will be consumed by the sandglass during the first t seconds from the initial number of grams of sand in the upper bulb.

So, the number of grams of sand that will be left in the upper bulb after t seconds is:

X grams - t grams = X - t grams

Therefore, the number of grams of sand that will be left in the upper bulb after t seconds is X -

Takahashi bought some food A days before the "best-by" date, and ate it B days after he bought it.
Write a program that outputs delicious if he found it delicious, safe if he did not found it delicious but did not get a stomachache either, and dangerous if he got a stomachache.

He ate the food three days after the "best-by" date. It was not delicious or harmful for him.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to determine whether Takahashi found the food delicious or not. We can do this by checking the following conditions:

1. If the "best-by" date of the food is X or more days earlier, then Takahashi will not find it delicious.
2. If the "best-by" date of the food is X+1 or more days earlier, then Takahashi will get a stomachache.
3. If Takahashi ate the food B days after he bought it, then he will not get a stomachache.

We can use these conditions to determine whether Takahashi found the food delicious or not. If the "best-by" date is X or more days earlier, then Takahashi will not find it delicious. If the "best-by" date is X+1 or more days earlier, then Takahashi will get a stomachache. If Takahashi ate the food B days after he bought it, then he will not get a stomachache.

Therefore, we can print "delicious" if Takahashi found the food delicious, "safe"

2. Iterate through each character in the string S.
3. If the character is not in the set "seen", add it to the set "seen".

You will appoint one of the N people as the leader, then command the rest of them to face in the direction of the leader.
Here, we do not care which direction the leader is facing.
The people in the row hate to change their directions, so you would like to select the leader so that the number of people who have to change their directions is minimized.
Find the minimum number of people who have to change their directions.

WEEWW

-----Sample Output-----
1

Assume that we appoint the third person from the west as the leader.
Then, the first person from the west needs to face east and has to turn around.
The other people do not need to change their directions, so the number of people who have to change their directions is 1 in this case.
It is not possible to have 0 people who have to change their directions, so the answer is 1.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the minimum number of people who have to change their directions when appointing one person as the leader and commanding the rest to face in the direction of the leader.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by appointing the person who is facing east as the leader. This person will not have to change their direction, so we can reduce the number of people who have to change their directions by 1.

Next, we can consider the person who is facing west. If we appoint this person as the leader, they will have to turn around to face east. This means that the person who was facing east before will not have to change their direction, and the person who was facing west before will have to change their direction.

We can continue this process by considering the person who is facing east after the leader has turned around, and so on. We can keep doing this until we have considered all the people in the row.

The key insight here is that we can always appoint the person who is facing east as the leader, because they will not have to change their direction. This means that we can reduce the number of people who have to change their directions

Next, we iterate through the connections and add each road to the hash table. For each road, we check if the city it connects to is already in the hash table. If it is, we increment the count for that city. If it's not, we add the city to the hash table and set the count to 1.

Finally, we print the count for each city.

Here is the code in Python:
```
# Read in the number of cities and roads
n, m = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize the hash table
city_counts = {}

# Iterate through the connections and add each road to the hash table
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a

You are taking a computer-based examination. The examination consists of N questions, and the score allocated to the i-th question is s_i. Your answer to each question will be judged as either "correct" or "incorrect", and your grade will be the sum of the points allocated to questions that are answered correctly. When you finish answering the questions, your answers will be immediately judged and your grade will be displayed... if everything goes well.
However, the examination system is actually flawed, and if your grade is a multiple of 10, the system displays 0 as your grade. Otherwise, your grade is displayed correctly. In this situation, what is the maximum value that can be displayed as your grade?

-----Constraints-----
 - All input values are integers.
 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
 - 1 ≤ s_i ≤ 100

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Your grade will be 25 if the 10-point and 15-point questions are answered correctly and the 5-point question is not, and this grade will be displayed correctly. Your grade will become 30 if the 5-point question is also answered correctly, but this grade will be incorrectly displayed as 0.

-----Plan-----
The maximum value that can be displayed as your grade is 25.

Here's how to arrive at this answer:

1. The examination consists of N questions, and the score allocated to each question is s_i.
2. The score for each question is a multiple of 10, and the system displays 0 as the grade if the score is a multiple of 10.
3. The maximum score that can be achieved is 100, and the maximum grade that can be displayed is 25.
4. If the 10-point and 15-point questions are answered correctly and the 5-point question is not, the score will be 10 + 15 = 25.
5. If the 5-point question is also answered correctly, the score will be 25 + 5 = 30.
6. However, if the 5-point question is not answered correctly, the score will be 25, which is a multiple of 10 and will be displayed as 0.

Therefore, the maximum value that can be displayed as your grade is 25.

You are given a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.
We will cut this string at one position into two strings X and Y.
Here, we would like to maximize the number of different letters contained in both X and Y.
Find the largest possible number of different letters contained in both X and Y when we cut the string at the optimal position.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 100
 - |S| = N
 - S consists of lowercase English letters.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S

-----Output-----
Print the largest possible number of different letters contained in both X and Y.

-----Sample Input-----

aabbca

-----Sample Output-----
2

If we cut the string between the third and fourth letters into X = aab and Y = bca, the letters contained in both X and Y are a and b.
There will never be three or more different letters contained in both X and Y, so the answer is 2.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the largest number of different letters contained in both X and Y when cutting the string at the optimal position.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array dp of size N x N, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of different letters contained in both X and Y when cutting the string between the i-th and j-th letters.

We can fill the dp array in the following way:

* dp[i][i] = 1, for all i from 1 to N
* dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 1, for all i from 1 to N and j from i+1 to N

The reason for this is that when we cut the string between the i-th and j-th letters, the number of different letters contained in both X and Y is equal to the number of different letters contained in both X and Y when cutting the string between the i+1-th and j-1-th letters plus 1.

We can then find the optimal position to cut the string by finding the

In Takahashi's town, a sunny day is followed by a cloudy day.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to predict the weather tomorrow based on the current weather today. The weather in Takahashi's town changes day by day in a cycle of Sunny, Cloudy, and Rainy.

To solve this problem, we need to find the next day in the cycle. We can do this by keeping track of the current day and the next day. If the current day is Sunny, the next day will be Cloudy. If the current day is Cloudy, the next day will be Rainy. If the current day is Rainy, the next day will be Sunny.

We can use a variable to keep track of the current day and a variable to keep track of the next day. We can initialize the current day to the first day in the cycle (Sunny). We can then use a conditional statement to determine the next day based on the current day.

Here is the solution in words:

1. Initialize the current day to Sunny.
2. If the current day is Sunny, set the next day to Cloudy.

When the minimum fee is x yen, print the value of x.

 - If you choose Plan 1, the fee will be 7×17=119 yen.
 - If you choose Plan 2, the fee will be 120 yen.
Thus, the minimum fee is 119 yen.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum fee when parking for N hours. We have two fee plans:

Plan 1: The fee will be A×T yen when you park for T hours.
Plan 2: The fee will be B yen, regardless of the duration.

We need to find the minimum fee when parking for N hours. We can start by considering Plan 2, where the fee is B yen regardless of the duration.

Let's assume that the minimum fee is x yen. We can calculate the fee for N hours using Plan 2:

Fee = B

We need to find the minimum value of x such that Fee = A×T when we park for T hours.

We can start by considering the case where T = 1 hour. In this case, the fee will be B yen.

If we park for 2 hours, the fee will be 2B yen.
If we park for 3 hours, the fee will be 3B yen.
And so on.

We can see that the fee for each hour is B yen, so the total fee for

Takahashi is now competing in a programming contest, but he received TLE in a problem where the answer is YES or NO.
When he checked the detailed status of the submission, there were N test cases in the problem, and the code received TLE in M of those cases.
Then, he rewrote the code to correctly solve each of those M cases with 1/2 probability in 1900 milliseconds, and correctly solve each of the other N-M cases without fail in 100 milliseconds.
Now, he goes through the following process:
 - Submit the code.
 - Wait until the code finishes execution on all the cases.
 - If the code fails to correctly solve some of the M cases, submit it again.
 - Repeat until the code correctly solve all the cases in one submission.
Let the expected value of the total execution time of the code be X milliseconds. Print X (as an integer).

-----Constraints-----
 - All input values are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 100
 - 1 \leq M \leq {\rm min}(N, 5)

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M

-----Output-----
Print X, the expected value of the total execution time of the code, as an integer. It can be proved that, under the constraints in this problem, X is an integer not exceeding 10^9.

-----Sample Input-----
1 1

-----Sample Output-----
3800

In this input, there is only one case. Takahashi will repeatedly submit the code that correctly solves this case with 1/2 probability in 1900 milliseconds.
The code will succeed in one attempt with 1/2 probability, in two attempts with 1/4 probability, and in three attempts with 1/8 probability, and so on.
Thus, the answer is 1900 \times 1/2 + (2 \times 1900) \times 1/4 + (3 \times 1900) \times 1/8 + ... = 3800.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the expected value of the total execution time of a code that solves a problem with N test cases, where M of those cases are known to be TLE. The code is able to solve each of the M cases with 1/2 probability in 1900 milliseconds, and correctly solve each of the other N-M cases without fail in 100 milliseconds.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected value of the total execution time of the code. We can do this by summing the probability of each case and multiplying it by the execution time of the code.

Let's first calculate the probability of each case. There are N total cases, and M of them are TLE. The probability of a case being TLE is 1/2, since the code is able to solve each of the M cases with 1/2 probability.

The probability of a case being solved correctly is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The probability of a case being solved incorrectly is 1/2.

Now, let's calculate the expected value of the total execution time of the code. We can do this by sum

The string atcoderregularcontest contains a, but does not contain b.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the smallest lowercase English letter that does not occur in the given string S. If every lowercase English letter occurs in S, then print None instead.

To solve this problem, you can use a simple approach. You can iterate through all the lowercase English letters and check if they occur in S or not. If a letter does not occur in S, then it is the smallest letter that does not occur in S.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize a variable smallest to None.
2. Iterate through all the lowercase English letters.
3. For each letter, check if it occurs in S or not. If it does not occur in S, then smallest = letter.
4. If smallest is still None, then it means that every lowercase English letter occurs in S. In this case, print None.
5. Otherwise, print smallest.

For each i = 1, 2, ..., N, let the median of X_1, X_2, ..., X_N excluding X_i, that is, the median of X_1, X_2, ..., X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, ..., X_N be B_i.
Find B_i for each i = 1, 2, ..., N.

 - Since the median of X_1, X_2, X_3 is 4, B_4 = 4.

To solve this problem, we need to find the median of each subarray of the given array, excluding the current element.

Let's consider the first element of the array, X_1. The median of X_1, X_2,..., X_N is the (N+1)/2-th largest value among X_1, X_2,..., X_N. Since N is even, the (N+1)/2-th largest value is the median of X_2, X_3,..., X_N.

Now, let's consider the second element of the array, X_2. The median of X_1, X_2,..., X_N excluding X_2 is the (N-1)/2-th largest value among X_1, X_3,..., X_N. Since N is even, the (N-1)/2-th largest value is the median of X_1, X_3,..., X_N.

We can continue this process for each element of the array, and find the median of the subarray excluding the current element.

The problem is to find the maximum possible area of a rectangle that can be formed using four sticks of different lengths. The sticks are given in the input as a list of integers.

The first step is to sort the sticks in non-decreasing order. This is done by comparing each pair of sticks and swapping them if the first stick is smaller than the second stick.

Next, we need to find the maximum possible area of the rectangle. We can do this by finding the maximum possible area of a rectangle that can be formed using the first stick and the last stick. We can do this by finding the maximum possible area of a rectangle that can be formed using the first stick and the last stick, and then finding the maximum possible area of a rectangle that can be formed using the second stick and the second-to-last stick. We can continue this process until we have found the maximum possible area of a rectangle that can be formed using all four sticks.

The maximum possible area of a rectangle that can be formed using four sticks is the maximum of the areas of all possible rectangles that can be formed using these sticks. We can find the maximum area of a rectangle by finding the maximum of the

 - The second participant eats one chocolate piece on Day 1 and 6, for a total of two.
 - The third participant eats one chocolate piece only on Day 1, for a total of one.
Since the number of pieces remaining at the end of the camp is one, the number of pieces prepared at the beginning of the camp is 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 8.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the number of chocolate pieces that were prepared at the beginning of the camp. We are given the number of participants, the number of days in the camp, and the number of days each participant eats chocolate pieces.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of chocolate pieces eaten by all participants during the camp. We can do this by adding up the number of chocolate pieces eaten by each participant.

The number of chocolate pieces eaten by each participant is given by the formula:

(A_i + 1) + (2A_i + 1) +... + (N \* A_i + 1)

where A_i is the number of days the i-th participant eats chocolate pieces.

We can simplify this formula by noticing that the number of chocolate pieces eaten by each participant is equal to the number of days the participant eats chocolate pieces, plus one.

Therefore, the total number of chocolate pieces eaten by all participants is:

 - Select zero 500-yen coins, zero 100-yen coins and two 50-yen coins.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to select some of the coins so that they are X yen in total.

We can start by considering the number of ways to select coins of each denomination. For example, if we have 2 500-yen coins, 2 100-yen coins and 2 50-yen coins, we can select them in 2! = 2 ways:

* Select zero 500-yen coins, one 100-yen coin and zero 50-yen coins.
* Select zero 500-yen coins, zero 100-yen coins and two 50-yen coins.

Now, we need to find the number of ways to select coins of each denomination such that the total value is X yen. We can do this by using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Akaki, a patissier, can make N kinds of doughnut using only a certain powder called "Okashi no Moto" (literally "material of pastry", simply called Moto below) as ingredient. These doughnuts are called Doughnut 1, Doughnut 2, ..., Doughnut N. In order to make one Doughnut i (1 ≤ i ≤ N), she needs to consume m_i grams of Moto. She cannot make a non-integer number of doughnuts, such as 0.5 doughnuts.
Now, she has X grams of Moto. She decides to make as many doughnuts as possible for a party tonight. However, since the tastes of the guests differ, she will obey the following condition:
 - For each of the N kinds of doughnuts, make at least one doughnut of that kind.
At most how many doughnuts can be made here? She does not necessarily need to consume all of her Moto. Also, under the constraints of this problem, it is always possible to obey the condition.

She has 1000 grams of Moto and can make three kinds of doughnuts. If she makes one doughnut for each of the three kinds, she consumes 120 + 100 + 140 = 360 grams of Moto. From the 640 grams of Moto that remains here, she can make additional six Doughnuts 2. This is how she can made a total of nine doughnuts, which is the maximum.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of doughnuts that Akaki can make using her Moto.

We can start by considering the first doughnut, Doughnut 1. Since Akaki needs to consume m_1 grams of Moto to make it, we know that she cannot make more than X/m_1 doughnuts of this kind.

Next, we consider the second doughnut, Doughnut 2. Since Akaki needs to consume m_2 grams of Moto to make it, we know that she cannot make more than X/m_2 doughnuts of this kind.

We continue this process for each of the N kinds of doughnuts, considering the maximum number of doughnuts that Akaki can make of each kind. We keep track of the maximum number of doughnuts that she can make of each kind, and we use this information to determine the maximum number of doughnuts that she can make in total.

We can use a loop to iterate through each of the N kinds of doughnuts, and we can use a variable to keep track of the maximum number of

How many kinds of items did you get?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 2\times 10^5
 - S_i consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 10 (inclusive).

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S_1

S_N

-----Output-----
Print the number of kinds of items you got.

-----Sample Input-----
3
apple
orange
apple

-----Sample Output-----
2

You got two kinds of items: apple and orange.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the number of unique items you got in the lottery. To do this, you need to count the number of unique strings that appear in the input.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input: The first line of input is the number of draws, N. The next N lines contain the strings representing the items you got in each draw.
2. Initialize a hash table: Create a hash table to store the unique strings you've seen so far.
3. Iterate over the input: Iterate over the input and for each string, check if it's already in the hash table. If it's not, add it to the hash table and increment a counter to keep track of the number of unique strings.
4. Print the result: Once you've iterated over all the input, print the number of unique strings you've seen.

Here's an example of how this would look in code:
```
# Read the input
n = int(input())
strings = []

# Initialize the hash table
unique_strings = set()

In AtCoder, a person who has participated in a contest receives a color, which corresponds to the person's rating as follows:  
 - Rating 1-399 : gray
 - Rating 400-799 : brown
 - Rating 800-1199 : green
 - Rating 1200-1599 : cyan
 - Rating 1600-1999 : blue
 - Rating 2000-2399 : yellow
 - Rating 2400-2799 : orange
 - Rating 2800-3199 : red
Other than the above, a person whose rating is 3200 or higher can freely pick his/her color, which can be one of the eight colors above or not.

Currently, there are N users who have participated in a contest in AtCoder, and the i-th user has a rating of a_i.

Find the minimum and maximum possible numbers of different colors of the users.  

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
 - 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 4800
 - a_i is an integer.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N

-----Output-----
Print the minimum possible number of different colors of the users, and the maximum possible number of different colors, with a space in between.  

-----Sample Input-----
4
2100 2500 2700 2700

-----Sample Output-----
2 2

The user with rating 2100 is "yellow", and the others are "orange". There are two different colors.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum and maximum number of different colors among all the users.

First, let's consider the case where all the users have a rating of 3200 or higher. In this case, each user can choose any color from the eight colors mentioned above. Therefore, the minimum number of different colors is 8, and the maximum number of different colors is also 8.

Now, let's consider the case where some users have a rating of 3200 or higher, and some users have a rating lower than 3200. In this case, we need to find the minimum and maximum number of different colors among all the users.

We can start by considering the minimum number of different colors. Since some users have a rating lower than 3200, we need to consider the colors that are assigned to these users. Let's say that the minimum number of different colors is k.

Now, let's consider the maximum number of different colors. Since some users have a rating higher than 3200, we need to consider the colors that are assigned to these users. Let's say that the maximum number of

In "Takahashi-ya", a ramen restaurant, a bowl of ramen costs 700 yen (the currency of Japan), plus 100 yen for each kind of topping (boiled egg, sliced pork, green onions).
A customer ordered a bowl of ramen and told which toppings to put on his ramen to a clerk. The clerk took a memo of the order as a string S. S is three characters long, and if the first character in S is o, it means the ramen should be topped with boiled egg; if that character is x, it means the ramen should not be topped with boiled egg. Similarly, the second and third characters in S mean the presence or absence of sliced pork and green onions on top of the ramen.
Write a program that, when S is given, prints the price of the corresponding bowl of ramen.

-----Constraints-----
 - S is a string of length 3.
 - Each character in S is o or x.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
Print the price of the bowl of ramen corresponding to S.

-----Sample Input-----
oxo

-----Sample Output-----
900

The price of a ramen topped with two kinds of toppings, boiled egg and green onions, is 700 + 100 \times 2 = 900 yen.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the ramen based on the toppings the customer ordered. We can do this by using a combination of string manipulation and conditional statements.

First, we need to check if the customer ordered boiled egg. If the first character in the string S is 'o', then the customer ordered boiled egg. We can do this by using the `if` statement.

Next, we need to check if the customer ordered sliced pork. If the second character in the string S is 'o', then the customer ordered sliced pork. We can do this by using the `if` statement again.

Finally, we need to check if the customer ordered green onions. If the third character in the string S is 'o', then the customer ordered green onions. We can do this by using the `if` statement again.

Once we have checked all three toppings, we can calculate the price of the ramen. We can do this by adding 700 yen (the cost of the ramen) and 100 yen for each topping the customer ordered. We can use the `+=` operator

Two deer, AtCoDeer and TopCoDeer, are playing a game called Honest or Dishonest.
In this game, an honest player always tells the truth, and an dishonest player always tell lies.
You are given two characters a and b as the input. Each of them is either H or D, and carries the following information:
If a=H, AtCoDeer is honest; if a=D, AtCoDeer is dishonest.
If b=H, AtCoDeer is saying that TopCoDeer is honest; if b=D, AtCoDeer is saying that TopCoDeer is dishonest.
Given this information, determine whether TopCoDeer is honest.

-----Constraints-----

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
a b

-----Output-----
If TopCoDeer is honest, print H. If he is dishonest, print D.

-----Sample Input-----
H H

-----Sample Output-----
H

In this input, AtCoDeer is honest. Hence, as he says, TopCoDeer is honest.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to determine whether TopCoDeer is honest based on the information provided by AtCoDeer.

AtCoDeer is either honest or dishonest, and he is telling the truth or lying about TopCoDeer's honesty.

If AtCoDeer is honest, then TopCoDeer is honest.
If AtCoDeer is dishonest, then TopCoDeer is dishonest.

So, we need to check whether AtCoDeer is honest or dishonest.

If a=H, then AtCoDeer is honest.
If a=D, then AtCoDeer is dishonest.

If b=H, then AtCoDeer is saying that TopCoDeer is honest.
If b=D, then AtCoDeer is saying that TopCoDeer is dishonest.

So, we need to check whether AtCoDeer is saying that TopCoDeer is honest or dishonest.

If AtCoDeer is honest and TopCoDeer is honest, then TopCoDeer is honest.

-----Output-----
Print the formula you made, including the part =7.
Use the signs + and -.
Do not print a space between a digit and a sign.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----
1+2+2+2=7

This is the only valid solution.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find a way to write the number 1222 using the symbols + and -, such that the formula A op1 B op2 C op3 D = 7 holds.

The given input guarantees that there is a solution, and there is only one solution.

To solve this problem, you can start by writing the number 1222 as a sum of four terms, using the symbols + and -. For example, you could write it as:

1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7

Now, you need to replace each of the symbols op1, op2, and op3 with either + or -, so that the formula holds.

For example, you could replace op1 with +, op2 with -, and op3 with +, like this:

1 + 2 - 2 + 2 = 7

This is a valid solution, and it is the only valid solution.

So, the final answer is:

1 + 2 - 2 + 2 = 7

A company has N members, who are assigned ID numbers 1, ..., N.
Every member, except the member numbered 1, has exactly one immediate boss with a smaller ID number.
When a person X is the immediate boss of a person Y, the person Y is said to be an immediate subordinate of the person X.
You are given the information that the immediate boss of the member numbered i is the member numbered A_i. For each member, find how many immediate subordinates it has.

The member numbered 1 has two immediate subordinates: the members numbered 2 and 3.
The member numbered 2 has two immediate subordinates: the members numbered 4 and 5.
The members numbered 3, 4, and 5 do not have immediate subordinates.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the number of immediate subordinates for each member of the company. The information given is that each member has exactly one immediate boss with a smaller ID number, and the immediate boss of the member numbered i is the member numbered A_i.

To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to store the immediate boss of each member. We can then use a loop to iterate through each member and find the number of immediate subordinates for each member.

Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize a dictionary called "boss" to store the immediate boss of each member.
2. Read the input and store the immediate boss of each member in the dictionary.
3. Initialize a list called "subordinates" to store the number of immediate subordinates for each member.

There is a kangaroo at coordinate 0 on an infinite number line that runs from left to right, at time 0.
During the period between time i-1 and time i, the kangaroo can either stay at his position, or perform a jump of length exactly i to the left or to the right.
That is, if his coordinate at time i-1 is x, he can be at coordinate x-i, x or x+i at time i.
The kangaroo's nest is at coordinate X, and he wants to travel to coordinate X as fast as possible.
Find the earliest possible time to reach coordinate X.

 - X is an integer.
 - 1≤X≤10^9

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X

-----Output-----
Print the earliest possible time for the kangaroo to reach coordinate X.

-----Sample Input-----
6

-----Sample Output-----

The kangaroo can reach his nest at time 3 by jumping to the right three times, which is the earliest possible time.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the earliest time at which the kangaroo can reach the nest. The kangaroo can either stay at his current position, or jump to the left or right. The distance between the kangaroo's current position and the nest is X.

To find the earliest time, we need to find the smallest integer t such that the kangaroo can reach the nest at time t. We can start by considering the case where the kangaroo stays at his current position. If the kangaroo stays at his current position, it will take t = X steps to reach the nest.

However, we can do better than this. We can consider the case where the kangaroo jumps to the left. If the kangaroo jumps to the left, it will take t = X - 1 steps to reach the nest. Similarly, if the kangaroo jumps to the right, it will take t = X + 1 steps to reach the nest.

We can now consider the case where the kangaroo jumps to the left or right. If the kangaroo jumps to the left, it will take t

The season for Snuke Festival has come again this year. First of all, Ringo will perform a ritual to summon Snuke. For the ritual, he needs an altar, which consists of three parts, one in each of the three categories: upper, middle and lower.
He has N parts for each of the three categories. The size of the i-th upper part is A_i, the size of the i-th middle part is B_i, and the size of the i-th lower part is C_i.
To build an altar, the size of the middle part must be strictly greater than that of the upper part, and the size of the lower part must be strictly greater than that of the middle part. On the other hand, any three parts that satisfy these conditions can be combined to form an altar.
How many different altars can Ringo build? Here, two altars are considered different when at least one of the three parts used is different.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9(1\leq i\leq N)
 - 1 \leq B_i \leq 10^9(1\leq i\leq N)

The following three altars can be built:
 - Upper: 1-st part, Middle: 1-st part, Lower: 1-st part
 - Upper: 1-st part, Middle: 1-st part, Lower: 2-nd part
 - Upper: 1-st part, Middle: 2-nd part, Lower: 2-nd part

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of different altars that Ringo can build.

First, we need to find the number of different combinations of three parts that satisfy the conditions. We can do this by finding the number of ways to choose three parts from the three categories, subject to the condition that the middle part is strictly greater than the upper part and the lower part is strictly greater than the middle part.

Let's denote the number of ways to choose three parts from the three categories as N. We can calculate N as follows:

N = (N_upper x N_middle x N_lower) / (N_middle x N_lower)

where N_upper, N_middle, and N_lower are the number of parts in each category.

We can calculate N_upper, N_middle, and N_lower as follows:

N_upper = N
N_middle = N - 1
N_lower = N - 2

Therefore, we can calculate N as follows:

N = (N x (N - 1) x (N - 2)) / ((N - 1) x (N -

In programming, hexadecimal notation is often used.
In hexadecimal notation, besides the ten digits 0, 1, ..., 9, the six letters A, B, C, D, E and F are used to represent the values 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, respectively.
In this problem, you are given two letters X and Y. Each X and Y is A, B, C, D, E or F.
When X and Y are seen as hexadecimal numbers, which is larger?

-----Constraints-----
 - Each X and Y is A, B, C, D, E or F.

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X Y

-----Output-----
If X is smaller, print <; if Y is smaller, print >; if they are equal, print =.

-----Sample Input-----

10 < 11.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to compare two hexadecimal numbers represented by two letters, X and Y. The letters can be any of A, B, C, D, E, or F.

To solve this problem, you need to convert the letters to their corresponding hexadecimal values. The hexadecimal values of A, B, C, D, E, and F are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively.

Once you have the hexadecimal values of X and Y, you can compare them directly. If X is smaller, print <; if Y is smaller, print >; if they are equal, print =.

For example, if X is A and Y is B, the hexadecimal values of X and Y are 10 and 11, respectively. Since 10 is smaller than 11, you should print <.

So, the solution to this problem is to convert the letters to their corresponding hexadecimal values and then compare them directly.

You are given an H × W grid.

The squares in the grid are described by H strings, S_1,...,S_H.

The j-th character in the string S_i corresponds to the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left (1 \leq i \leq H,1 \leq j \leq W).
. stands for an empty square, and # stands for a square containing a bomb.  
Dolphin is interested in how many bomb squares are horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent to each empty square.

(Below, we will simply say "adjacent" for this meaning. For each square, there are at most eight adjacent squares.)

He decides to replace each . in our H strings with a digit that represents the number of bomb squares adjacent to the corresponding empty square.  
Print the strings after the process.  

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq H,W \leq 50
 - S_i is a string of length W consisting of # and ..

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:  
H W
S_1

-----Output-----
Print the H strings after the process.

The i-th line should contain a string T_i of length W, where the j-th character in T_i corresponds to the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th row from the left in the grid (1 \leq i \leq H, 1 \leq j \leq W).  

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----

11211

For example, let us observe the empty square at the first row from the top and first column from the left.

There is one bomb square adjacent to this empty square: the square at the second row and second column.

Thus, the . corresponding to this empty square is replaced with 1.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of bomb squares that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent to each empty square in the grid. We can do this by using a two-dimensional array to keep track of the number of bomb squares adjacent to each empty square.

We can start by initializing the array with all zeros. This means that initially, there are no bomb squares adjacent to any empty square.

Next, we need to iterate through each row of the grid and count the number of bomb squares that are adjacent to each empty square. We can do this by using a nested loop to iterate through each row and column of the grid.

Inside the nested loop, we can check if the current square is empty (i.e., it contains a dot). If it is, we can check if there is a bomb square adjacent to it (i.e., if there is a bomb square in the same row, column, or diagonal as the current square). If there is, we can increment the corresponding entry in the array by 1.

Once we have counted the number of bomb squares that are adjacent to each empty square, we can print the array as the final answer.

We have two desks: A and B. Desk A has a vertical stack of N books on it, and Desk B similarly has M books on it.
It takes us A_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk A (1 \leq i \leq N), and B_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk B (1 \leq i \leq M).
Consider the following action:
 - Choose a desk with a book remaining, read the topmost book on that desk, and remove it from the desk.
How many books can we read at most by repeating this action so that it takes us at most K minutes in total? We ignore the time it takes to do anything other than reading.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N, M \leq 200000
 - 1 \leq K \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M K

B_1 B_2 \ldots B_M

Print an integer representing the maximum number of books that can be read.

-----Sample Input-----
3 4 240
60 90 120
80 150 80 150

-----Sample Output-----
3

In this case, it takes us 60, 90, 120 minutes to read the 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd books from the top on Desk A, and 80, 150, 80, 150 minutes to read the 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd, 4-th books from the top on Desk B, respectively.
We can read three books in 230 minutes, as shown below, and this is the maximum number of books we can read within 240 minutes.
 - Read the topmost book on Desk A in 60 minutes, and remove that book from the desk.
 - Read the topmost book on Desk B in 80 minutes, and remove that book from the desk.
 - Read the topmost book on Desk A in 90 minutes, and remove that book from the desk.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the maximum number of books that can be read within a time limit of K minutes. The time it takes to read a book from the top of a desk is given by the corresponding value in the A_i and B_i arrays.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by choosing the desk with the book that takes the least time to read. If there are multiple books on the same desk, we can choose the book that takes the least time to read.

We can repeat this process until we have read all the books or we have reached the time limit of K minutes. We can keep track of the total time it takes to read all the books and the number of books we have read.

The maximum number of books we can read within K minutes is the number of books we have read at the end of the process.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Choose the desk with the book that takes the least time to read. If there are multiple books on the same desk, choose the book that takes the least time to read.
2. Read the top

-----Sample Output-----

It is optimal to buy four AB-pizzas and rearrange them into two A-pizzas and two B-pizzas, then buy additional one A-pizza.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum amount of money required to prepare X A-pizzas and Y B-pizzas.

We can start by considering the case where Nakahashi buys only A-pizzas and B-pizzas. The total cost of A-pizzas is X times A yen, and the total cost of B-pizzas is Y times B yen. Therefore, the total cost of A-pizzas and B-pizzas is X times A yen + Y times B yen.

However, we can do better by buying two AB-pizzas and rearranging them into one A-pizza and one B-pizza. The cost of two AB-pizzas is 2 times C yen. Therefore, the cost of one A-pizza and one B-pizza is 2 times C yen + 1 times A yen + 1 times B yen.

Now, we need to find the minimum amount of money required to prepare X A-pizzas and Y B-pizzas. We can do this by finding the minimum amount of money required to

-----Output-----

There are four divisors of 3! =6: 1, 2, 3 and 6. Thus, the output should be 4.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive divisors of N! modulo 10^9+7.

First, we need to find the factorial of N. We can do this by multiplying N by (N-1) and then by (N-2) and so on until we reach 1.

Once we have the factorial of N, we need to find the number of positive divisors of it. We can do this by dividing the factorial by all the positive divisors of N and counting the number of times each divisor appears.

For example, if N = 3, then the factorial of N is 6. The positive divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3. So, the number of positive divisors of 6 is 3.

To find the number of positive divisors of N!, we need to divide N! by all the positive divisors of N and count the number of times each divisor appears. We can do this by using a loop to iterate through all the positive divisors of N and counting the number of times each divisor appears in the factorial of N.

-----Output-----

There are four perfect powers that are at most 10: 1, 4, 8 and 9.
We should print the largest among them, 9.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the largest perfect power that is at most X. A perfect power is an integer that can be represented as b^p, where b is an integer not less than 1 and p is an integer not less than 2.

We can start by finding the largest perfect power that is less than or equal to X. We can do this by finding the largest integer b such that b^p is less than or equal to X. We can do this by using a binary search algorithm.

We can start by setting b = 1 and p = 2. We can then check if b^p is less than or equal to X. If it is, we can update our answer and move on to the next iteration. If it is not, we can decrease p by 1 and try again.

We can continue this process until we find the largest perfect power that is less than or equal to X. Once we have found this perfect power, we can print it as our answer.

For example, if X = 10, we can start by setting b = 1 and p = 2. We can then check if 1^2 is less than or equal

An X-layered kagami mochi (X ≥ 1) is a pile of X round mochi (rice cake) stacked vertically where each mochi (except the bottom one) has a smaller diameter than that of the mochi directly below it. For example, if you stack three mochi with diameters of 10, 8 and 6 centimeters from bottom to top in this order, you have a 3-layered kagami mochi; if you put just one mochi, you have a 1-layered kagami mochi.
Lunlun the dachshund has N round mochi, and the diameter of the i-th mochi is d_i centimeters. When we make a kagami mochi using some or all of them, at most how many layers can our kagami mochi have?

If we stack the mochi with diameters of 10, 8 and 6 centimeters from bottom to top in this order, we have a 3-layered kagami mochi, which is the maximum number of layers.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the maximum number of layers that can be formed by stacking a set of round mochi (rice cakes) in a kagami mochi. The kagami mochi is a pile of X round mochi (rice cakes) stacked vertically where each mochi (except the bottom one) has a smaller diameter than that of the mochi directly below it.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of layers that can be formed by stacking the given set of round mochi. We can do this by analyzing the diameters of the mochi and finding the maximum number of layers that can be formed by stacking them in a way that satisfies the condition that each mochi has a smaller diameter than that of the mochi directly below it.

Let's consider a set of N round mochi with diameters d_1, d_2,..., d_N. We can stack these mochi in a kagami mochi by starting with the largest diameter mochi and then stacking the remaining mochi on top of it in a way that satisfies the condition that each mochi has a smaller diameter than that of the mochi

 - There exists a substring of s that starts with A and ends with Z.

-----Output-----

-----Sample Input-----
QWERTYASDFZXCV

-----Sample Output-----
5

By taking out the seventh through eleventh characters, it is possible to construct ASDFZ, which starts with A and ends with Z.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the longest substring of the input string that starts with A and ends with Z.

We can do this by iterating through the characters of the input string and keeping track of the current substring. When we encounter a character that is not in the substring, we can check if it is the first character of the substring. If it is, we can add it to the substring. If it is not, we can check if it is the last character of the substring. If it is, we can add it to the substring.

We can also keep track of the maximum length of the substring that we have found so far. When we find a substring that is longer than the current maximum, we can update the maximum.

At the end, we can print the maximum length of the substring that we have found.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Python:
```
s = input()

max_length = 0
substring = ""

for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] in substring:

There are N positive integers written on a blackboard: A_1, ..., A_N.
Snuke can perform the following operation when all integers on the blackboard are even:
 - Replace each integer X on the blackboard by X divided by 2.
Find the maximum possible number of operations that Snuke can perform.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 200
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9

-----Output-----

-----Sample Input-----
3
8 12 40

-----Sample Output-----

Initially, [8, 12, 40] are written on the blackboard.
Since all those integers are even, Snuke can perform the operation.
After the operation is performed once, [4, 6, 20] are written on the blackboard.
Since all those integers are again even, he can perform the operation.
After the operation is performed twice, [2, 3, 10] are written on the blackboard.
Now, there is an odd number 3 on the blackboard, so he cannot perform the operation any more.
Thus, Snuke can perform the operation at most twice.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the maximum number of operations that Snuke can perform on the blackboard. The operation is to divide each even number on the blackboard by 2. The constraint is that all the numbers on the blackboard are positive integers.

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of operations that Snuke can perform. We can do this by analyzing the numbers on the blackboard and determining when Snuke can no longer perform the operation.

Let's consider the following cases:

1. If all the numbers on the blackboard are even, Snuke can perform the operation as many times as there are even numbers on the blackboard.
2. If there is an odd number on the blackboard, Snuke can no longer perform the operation.

Now, let's consider the input:

N = 3
A_1 = 8
A_2 = 12
A_3 = 40

In this case, all the numbers on the blackboard are even, so Snuke can perform the operation as many times as there are even numbers on the blackboard, which is 3 times.

 - After Snuke exercises for the first time, his power gets multiplied by 1 and becomes 1.
 - After Snuke exercises for the second time, his power gets multiplied by 2 and becomes 2.
 - After Snuke exercises for the third time, his power gets multiplied by 3 and becomes 6.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the power of Snuke after he exercises N times. We can do this by multiplying the power by the number of times he exercises.

Let's say Snuke exercises for the i-th time, and his power becomes P after that. Then, the power after the (i+1)-th time will be P \* (i+1).

We can see that the power after the i-th time is equal to the power after the (i-1)-th time multiplied by i. This means that the power after the N-th time will be equal to the power after the (N-1)-th time multiplied by N.

So, we can write the formula for the power after the N-th time as:

P_N = P_1 \* N

where P_1 is the power after the first time, and P_N is the power after the N-th time.

Since the answer can be extremely large, we need to print the answer modulo 10^9+7. We can do this by taking the remainder of the result of the

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to play a game with N cards. The cards have numbers written on them, and the game ends when all the cards are taken. The score of each player is the sum of the numbers written on the cards they have taken. The goal is to find the difference between Alice's score and Bob's score when both players take the optimal strategy to maximize their scores.

To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. The optimal strategy for Alice is to take the card with the highest number, and the optimal strategy for Bob is to take the card with the lowest number.

Here's how we can implement this strategy:

1. Alice starts by taking the card with the highest number.
2. Bob takes the card with the lowest number.
3. The game continues with the next card, and the process repeats.

The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob leads to the highest possible difference between their scores. When both players take the optimal strategy, Alice's score is the sum of the numbers written on the cards she has taken, and Bob's score is the sum of the numbers written on the cards

The contest had N problems.
Takahashi made M submissions during the contest.
The i-th submission was made for the p_i-th problem and received the verdict S_i (AC or WA).
The number of Takahashi's correct answers is the number of problems on which he received an AC once or more.
The number of Takahashi's penalties is the sum of the following count for the problems on which he received an AC once or more: the number of WAs received before receiving an AC for the first time on that problem.
Find the numbers of Takahashi's correct answers and penalties.

-----Constraints-----
 - N, M, and p_i are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 0 \leq M \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq p_i \leq N
 - S_i is AC or WA.

In his second submission, he received an AC on the first problem for the first time. Before this, he received one WA on this problem.
In his fourth submission, he received an AC on the second problem for the first time. Before this, he received one WA on this problem.
Thus, he has two correct answers and two penalties.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the number of correct answers and penalties for each problem.

We can do this by creating a data structure to store the number of correct answers and penalties for each problem. We can use a hash table or a dictionary to map each problem to its corresponding number of correct answers and penalties.

We can then iterate through the input and update the data structure for each problem. If the verdict is AC, we can increment the number of correct answers for that problem. If the verdict is WA, we can increment the number of penalties for that problem.

Once we have processed all the input, we can print the number of correct answers and penalties by accessing the corresponding values in the data structure.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Python:

# Initialize the data structure to store the number of correct answers and penalties for each problem

penalties = {}

# Iterate through the input and update the data structure

Fennec is fighting with N monsters.
The health of the i-th monster is H_i.
Fennec can do the following two actions:

 - Special Move: Fennec chooses one monster. That monster's health will become 0.
There is no way other than Attack and Special Move to decrease the monsters' health.
Fennec wins when all the monsters' healths become 0 or below.
Find the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning when she can use Special Move at most K times.

-----Constraints-----

-----Output-----

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----
5

By using Special Move on the third monster, and doing Attack four times on the first monster and once on the second monster, Fennec can win with five Attacks.

-----Plan-----
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning when she can use Special Move at most j times and there are i monsters left to fight.

We can initialize dp[i][0] = i, since Fennec needs to do Attack i times to defeat all the monsters.

For dp[i][j], we can consider two cases:

1. Fennec uses Special Move on the i-th monster. In this case, we need to do Attack (i-1) times on the remaining monsters.
2. Fennec does not use Special Move on the i-th monster. In this case, we need to do Attack (i-1) times on the remaining monsters and then do Special Move on the i-th monster.

We can use the following recurrence relation to calculate dp[i][j]:

There are N balls in the xy-plane. The coordinates of the i-th of them is (x_i, i).
Thus, we have one ball on each of the N lines y = 1, y = 2, ..., y = N.
In order to collect these balls, Snuke prepared 2N robots, N of type A and N of type B.
Then, he placed the i-th type-A robot at coordinates (0, i), and the i-th type-B robot at coordinates (K, i).
Thus, now we have one type-A robot and one type-B robot on each of the N lines y = 1, y = 2, ..., y = N.
When activated, each type of robot will operate as follows.
 - When a type-A robot is activated at coordinates (0, a), it will move to the position of the ball on the line y = a, collect the ball, move back to its original position (0, a) and deactivate itself. If there is no such ball, it will just deactivate itself without doing anything.
 - When a type-B robot is activated at coordinates (K, b), it will move to the position of the ball on the line y = b, collect the ball, move back to its original position (K, b) and deactivate itself. If there is no such ball, it will just deactivate itself without doing anything.
Snuke will activate some of the 2N robots to collect all of the balls. Find the minimum possible total distance covered by robots.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 100
 - 1 \leq K \leq 100

-----Outputs-----

-----Sample Input-----

2

-----Sample Output-----
4

There are just one ball, one type-A robot and one type-B robot.
If the type-A robot is used to collect the ball, the distance from the robot to the ball is 2, and the distance from the ball to the original position of the robot is also 2, for a total distance of 4.
Similarly, if the type-B robot is used, the total distance covered will be 16.
Thus, the total distance covered will be minimized when the type-A robot is used. The output should be 4.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum distance that the robots can cover to collect all the balls.

We can start by considering the distance that each robot can cover.

* A type-A robot can cover a distance of 2 units from its original position to the ball and back.
* A type-B robot can cover a distance of 10 units from its original position to the ball and back.

Now, let's consider the distance that each robot can cover when it is activated.

* When a type-A robot is activated, it will move to the position of the ball on the line y = a, collect the ball, move back to its original position (0, a), and deactivate itself. The distance covered by the robot is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 units.
* When a type-B robot is activated, it will move to the position of the ball on the line y = b, collect the ball, move back to its original position (K, b), and deactivate itself. The distance covered by the robot is 10 + 2 + 10 = 18 units.

Similarly, the bus fare will be C yen if you buy ordinary tickets along the way, and D yen if you buy an unlimited ticket.
Find the minimum total fare when the optimal choices are made for trains and buses.

The train fare will be 600 yen if you buy ordinary tickets, and 300 yen if you buy an unlimited ticket.
Thus, the optimal choice for trains is to buy an unlimited ticket for 300 yen.
On the other hand, the optimal choice for buses is to buy ordinary tickets for 220 yen.
Therefore, the minimum total fare is 300 + 220 = 520 yen.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the minimum total fare for a trip that involves trains and buses. The fare for trains and buses are given as A, B, C, and D, respectively. The fare for trains is A if you buy ordinary tickets, and B if you buy an unlimited ticket. Similarly, the fare for buses is C if you buy ordinary tickets, and D if you buy an unlimited ticket.

To solve this problem, you need to find the optimal choices for trains and buses. The optimal choices are the ones that minimize the total fare.

For trains, the optimal choice is to buy an unlimited ticket for 300 yen. This is because the fare for trains is 600 yen if you buy ordinary tickets, and 300 yen if you buy an unlimited ticket. Therefore, buying an unlimited ticket for 300 yen is the optimal choice for trains.

For buses, the optimal choice is to buy ordinary tickets for 220 yen. This is because the fare for buses is 420 yen if you buy ordinary tickets, and 220

However, each person remembered the following fact: the absolute difference of the number of the people who were standing to the left of that person, and the number of the people who were standing to the right of that person.
According to their reports, the difference above for person i is A_i.
Based on these reports, find the number of the possible orders in which they were standing.
Since it can be extremely large, print the answer modulo 10^9+7.
Note that the reports may be incorrect and thus there may be no consistent order.
In such a case, print 0.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1≦N≦10^5
 - 0≦A_i≦N-1

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

-----Output-----
Print the number of the possible orders in which they were standing, modulo 10^9+7.

-----Sample Input-----
5
2 4 4 0 2

-----Sample Output-----
4

There are four possible orders, as follows:
 - 2,1,4,5,3
 - 2,5,4,1,3
 - 3,1,4,5,2
 - 3,5,4,1,2

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to find the number of possible orders in which the people were standing yesterday, based on the information provided by each person.

To solve this problem, we can use a technique called "backtracking". We will start by considering the first person, and then recursively consider the remaining people. For each person, we will consider all possible orders in which they could have been standing, and then recursively consider the remaining people.

We will keep track of the number of possible orders in a variable called "count". We will initialize this variable to 1, since there is always at least one possible order (the order in which the people were standing yesterday).

As we consider each person, we will keep track of the number of people who were standing to the left of that person, and the number of people who were standing to the right of that person. We will use these numbers to determine the possible orders in which the person could have been standing.

For example, if the first person was standing to the left of 2 people and to the right of 3 people, then there are 2! = 2 possible orders in which the first person could have been standing (left to right, or right

Among the integers not greater than 20, the ones whose sums of digits are between 2 and 5, are: 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20. We should print the sum of these, 84.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the sum of the integers between 1 and N (inclusive), whose sum of digits written in base 10 is between A and B (inclusive).

To solve this problem, we need to find the integers between 1 and N (inclusive) that have a sum of digits between A and B (inclusive).

We can start by finding the integers between 1 and N (inclusive) that have a sum of digits between A and B (inclusive). We can do this by iterating through each integer between 1 and N (inclusive) and checking if its sum of digits is between A and B (inclusive).

Once we have found the integers between 1 and N (inclusive) that have a sum of digits between A and B (inclusive), we can calculate their sum and print it.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the value of N. The space complexity is O(1) because we only need to store the sum of the integers between 1 and N (inclusive) that have a sum of digits between A and B (inclusive

This contest, AtCoder Beginner Contest, is abbreviated as ABC.
When we refer to a specific round of ABC, a three-digit number is appended after ABC. For example, ABC680 is the 680th round of ABC.
What is the abbreviation for the N-th round of ABC? Write a program to output the answer.

The 100th round of ABC is ABC100.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking for the abbreviation for the N-th round of the AtCoder Beginner Contest (ABC). The abbreviation is in the format of ABC followed by a three-digit number.

To solve this problem, we need to write a program that takes an input N, which is the number of the round, and outputs the abbreviation for that round.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input N from Standard Input.
2. Calculate the three-digit number for the round by adding 100 to N.
3. Concatenate the string "ABC" with the calculated number to get the abbreviation for the round.
4. Print the abbreviation to Standard Output.

In AtCoder Kingdom, Gregorian calendar is used, and dates are written in the "year-month-day" order, or the "month-day" order without the year.

For example, May 3, 2018 is written as 2018-5-3, or 5-3 without the year.  
In this country, a date is called Takahashi when the month and the day are equal as numbers. For example, 5-5 is Takahashi.

How many days from 2018-1-1 through 2018-a-b are Takahashi?

-----Constraints-----
 - a is an integer between 1 and 12 (inclusive).
 - b is an integer between 1 and 31 (inclusive).
 - 2018-a-b is a valid date in Gregorian calendar.

There are five days that are Takahashi: 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4 and 5-5.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of Takahashi days between 2018-1-1 and 2018-a-b.

First, we need to convert the input a and b to integers. Then, we need to create a loop that iterates from 1 to a, and for each iteration, we need to check if the current day is Takahashi.

Here's the pseudocode for the solution:

1. Read the input a and b from Standard Input.
2. Convert a and b to integers.
3. Create a loop that iterates from 1 to a.
4. For each iteration, create a string that represents the current day in the format "month-day".

Takahashi wants to gain muscle, and decides to work out at AtCoder Gym.
The exercise machine at the gym has N buttons, and exactly one of the buttons is lighten up.
These buttons are numbered 1 through N.
When Button i is lighten up and you press it, the light is turned off, and then Button a_i will be lighten up. It is possible that i=a_i.
When Button i is not lighten up, nothing will happen by pressing it.
Initially, Button 1 is lighten up. Takahashi wants to quit pressing buttons when Button 2 is lighten up.
Determine whether this is possible. If the answer is positive, find the minimum number of times he needs to press buttons.

 - 1 ≤ a_i ≤ N

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

2

-----Sample Output-----

Press Button 1, then Button 3.

-----Plan-----
This problem is a classic problem in graph theory. We can solve it by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.

First, we need to create a graph with N vertices, where each vertex represents a button. We can use an adjacency list to represent the graph. Each vertex has a list of its neighbors, which are the buttons that are connected to it.

We can start by lighting up Button 1. We can then use a BFS algorithm to traverse the graph, starting from Button 1. At each step, we can light up the next button that is not lighted up. We can keep track of the number of times we need to press buttons by incrementing a counter each time we press a button.

If we reach Button 2 while traversing the graph, we can print the minimum number of times we need to press buttons. If we cannot reach Button 2, we can print -1.

Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:

1. Create a graph with N vertices, where each vertex represents a button.
2. Light up Button 1.

You are playing the following game with Joisino.
 - Initially, you have a blank sheet of paper.
 - Joisino announces a number. If that number is written on the sheet, erase the number from the sheet; if not, write the number on the sheet. This process is repeated N times.
 - Then, you are asked a question: How many numbers are written on the sheet now?
The numbers announced by Joisino are given as A_1, ... ,A_N in the order she announces them. How many numbers will be written on the sheet at the end of the game?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1≤N≤100000

The game proceeds as follows:
 - 6 is not written on the sheet, so write 6.
 - 2 is not written on the sheet, so write 2.
 - 6 is written on the sheet, so erase 6.
Thus, the sheet contains only 2 in the end. The answer is 1.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to play a game with Joisino, where you start with a blank sheet of paper and she announces a number. If the number is not already written on the sheet, you write it. If it is already written, you erase it. This process is repeated N times. After the Nth announcement, you are asked how many numbers are written on the sheet.

To solve this problem, you need to keep track of the numbers that have been written on the sheet. You can do this by using a data structure such as an array or a hash table. Each time Joisino announces a number, you check if it is already in the data structure. If it is, you erase it. If it is not, you add it to the data structure.

After the Nth announcement, you can count the number of elements in the data structure to find out how many numbers are written on the sheet.

Takahashi has N balls. Initially, an integer A_i is written on the i-th ball.
He would like to rewrite the integer on some balls so that there are at most K different integers written on the N balls.
Find the minimum number of balls that Takahashi needs to rewrite the integers on them.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq K \leq N \leq 200000
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq N
 - All input values are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

-----Output-----
Print the minimum number of balls that Takahashi needs to rewrite the integers on them.

-----Sample Input-----
5 2
1 1 2 2 5

-----Sample Output-----
1

For example, if we rewrite the integer on the fifth ball to 2, there are two different integers written on the balls: 1 and 2.
On the other hand, it is not possible to rewrite the integers on zero balls so that there are at most two different integers written on the balls, so we should print 1.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of balls that Takahashi needs to rewrite the integers on them so that there are at most K different integers written on the N balls.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by sorting the integers from smallest to largest. Then, we can start rewriting the integers on the balls from the smallest to the largest.

For each integer, we can either rewrite it on a ball that already has the same integer written on it, or we can rewrite it on a new ball. If we rewrite it on a new ball, we need to increase the number of balls by 1.

We can keep track of the number of balls that we need to rewrite the integers on them by using a hash table. For each integer, we can store the number of balls that have that integer written on them.

At the end, we can print the minimum number of balls that Takahashi needs to rewrite the integers on them.

Here is an example of how we can solve this problem:

Sort the integers from smallest to largest: 1 1

In his plan, he will depart from point (0, 0) at time 0, then for each i between 1 and N (inclusive), he will visit point (x_i,y_i) at time t_i.
If AtCoDeer is at point (x, y) at time t, he can be at one of the following points at time t+1: (x+1,y), (x-1,y), (x,y+1) and (x,y-1).

-----Sample Output-----

For example, he can travel as follows: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), then (1,1).

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to check whether AtCoDeer can reach all the points in his plan. We can do this by simulating his journey and checking whether he can reach all the points at each time step.

We can start by reading the input, which consists of the number of points (N) and the coordinates of each point (x_i, y_i) and the time at which he will visit each point (t_i). We can store these values in a data structure such as an array or a list.

Next, we can create a boolean array to keep track of whether AtCoDeer has visited each point. We can initialize all the values in the array to false, indicating that AtCoDeer has not visited any point yet.

We can then simulate AtCoDeer's journey by iterating through each point in his plan and checking whether he can reach that point at each time step. We can use the following rules to determine whether AtCoDeer can reach a point:

* If AtCoDeer is at point (x, y) at time t, he can reach point (x+1, y) at time t+1.

You are given an undirected connected graph with N vertices and M edges that does not contain self-loops and double edges.

The i-th edge (1 \leq i \leq M) connects Vertex a_i and Vertex b_i.  
An edge whose removal disconnects the graph is called a bridge.

Find the number of the edges that are bridges among the M edges.  

-----Notes-----
 - A self-loop is an edge i such that a_i=b_i (1 \leq i \leq M).
 - Double edges are a pair of edges i,j such that a_i=a_j and b_i=b_j (1 \leq i<j \leq M).

The edges shown in red are bridges. There are four of them.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the number of bridges in an undirected connected graph with N vertices and M edges. A bridge is an edge that, when removed, disconnects the graph.

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The basic idea is to start from a vertex in the graph and explore all the vertices reachable from it. If we encounter an edge that connects two vertices that are not connected by any other edge, we mark it as a bridge.

Here's a step-by-step description of the algorithm:

Among A, B and C, print the integer that is different from the rest.

-----Sample Input-----

-----Sample Output-----

This is the same case as the one in the statement.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the integer that is different from the rest among the given three integers.

We can do this by using a simple algorithm. We can create a set of the three integers and then check if the size of the set is equal to 2. If it is, then we know that two of the integers are the same, and the remaining one is different.

We can then print the remaining integer as the answer.

Here is the code in Python:
```
A, B, C = map(int, input().split())

if A == B:
    print(C)
else:
    print(A)
```
This code first takes the input from the user in the format A B C. It then converts the input into integers using the map() function and assigns them to A, B, and C.

Next, it checks if A and B are the same. If they are, then it prints C as the answer. If they are not, then it prints A as the answer.

This solution works for all the test cases in the problem statement.

Snuke is making sugar water in a beaker.
Initially, the beaker is empty. Snuke can perform the following four types of operations any number of times. He may choose not to perform some types of operations.
 - Operation 1: Pour 100A grams of water into the beaker.
 - Operation 2: Pour 100B grams of water into the beaker.
 - Operation 3: Put C grams of sugar into the beaker.
 - Operation 4: Put D grams of sugar into the beaker.
In our experimental environment, E grams of sugar can dissolve into 100 grams of water.
Snuke will make sugar water with the highest possible density.
The beaker can contain at most F grams of substances (water and sugar combined), and there must not be any undissolved sugar in the beaker.
Find the mass of the sugar water Snuke will make, and the mass of sugar dissolved in it.
If there is more than one candidate, any of them will be accepted.
We remind you that the sugar water that contains a grams of water and b grams of sugar is \frac{100b}{a + b} percent.
Also, in this problem, pure water that does not contain any sugar is regarded as 0 percent density sugar water.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq A < B \leq 30
 - 1 \leq C < D \leq 30
 - 1 \leq E \leq 100
 - 100A \leq F \leq 3 000
 - A, B, C, D, E and F are all integers.

-----Inputs-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B C D E F

-----Outputs-----
Print two integers separated by a space.
The first integer should be the mass of the desired sugar water, and the second should be the mass of the sugar dissolved in it.

-----Sample Input-----
1 2 10 20 15 200

-----Sample Output-----
110 10

In this environment, 15 grams of sugar can dissolve into 100 grams of water, and the beaker can contain at most 200 grams of substances.
We can make 110 grams of sugar water by performing Operation 1 once and Operation 3 once.
It is not possible to make sugar water with higher density.
For example, the following sequences of operations are infeasible:
 - If we perform Operation 1 once and Operation 4 once, there will be undissolved sugar in the beaker.
 - If we perform Operation 2 once and Operation 3 three times, the mass of substances in the beaker will exceed 200 grams.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum amount of sugar water that can be made with the given constraints.

We can start by considering the case where we perform Operation 1 once and Operation 3 once. This will give us a mass of 100A + C grams of sugar water, where C is the mass of sugar that can dissolve in 100A grams of water.

We can then consider the case where we perform Operation 2 once and Operation 3 once. This will give us a mass of 100B + C grams of sugar water, where B is the mass of sugar that can dissolve in 100B grams of water.

We can then consider the case where we perform Operation 1 once and Operation 4 once. This will give us a mass of 100A + D grams of sugar water, where D is the mass of sugar that can dissolve in 100A grams of water.

We can then consider the case where we perform Operation 2 once and Operation 4 once. This will give us a mass of 100B + D grams of sugar water,

To solve this problem, you need to find the position of the first letter "i" in the word "internationalization" and the position of the last letter "n" in the word "internationalization". The distance between these two positions is 18 letters.

For example, if s is "internationalization", the first letter "i" is at position 0 and the last letter "n" is at position 18. The distance between these two positions is 18 letters, so the abbreviation of s is "i18n".

You are given a grid with 2 rows and 3 columns of squares.
The color of the square at the i-th row and j-th column is represented by the character C_{ij}.
Write a program that prints YES if this grid remains the same when rotated 180 degrees, and prints NO otherwise.

-----Constraints-----
 - C_{i,j}(1 \leq i \leq 2, 1 \leq j \leq 3) is a lowercase English letter.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
C_{11}C_{12}C_{13}
C_{21}C_{22}C_{23}

-----Output-----
Print YES if this grid remains the same when rotated 180 degrees; print NO otherwise.

-----Sample Input-----
pot
top

-----Sample Output-----
YES

This grid remains the same when rotated 180 degrees.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to check if the grid remains the same when rotated 180 degrees. We can do this by checking if the characters in each row are the same as the characters in the corresponding row of the rotated grid.

Here's an example of how we can do this:

Let's say we have the following grid:

C_{11}C_{12}C_{13}
C_{21}C_{22}C_{23}

If we rotate this grid 180 degrees, we get the following grid:

C_{23}C_{22}C_{21}
C_{13}C_{12}C_{11}

As we can see, the characters in each row of the original grid are the same as the characters in the corresponding row of the rotated grid. Therefore, we can print YES, indicating that the grid remains the same when rotated 180 degrees.

If the characters in each row of the original grid are not the same as the characters in the corresponding row of the rotated grid, then we can print NO, indicating that

You are given a string s.
Among the different substrings of s, print the K-th lexicographically smallest one.
A substring of s is a string obtained by taking out a non-empty contiguous part in s.
For example, if s = ababc, a, bab and ababc are substrings of s, while ac, z and an empty string are not.
Also, we say that substrings are different when they are different as strings.
Let X = x_{1}x_{2}...x_{n} and Y = y_{1}y_{2}...y_{m} be two distinct strings. X is lexicographically larger than Y if and only if Y is a prefix of X or x_{j} > y_{j} where j is the smallest integer such that x_{j} \neq y_{j}.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000
 - s consists of lowercase English letters.
 - 1 ≤ K ≤ 5
 - s has at least K different substrings.

-----Partial Score-----
 - 200 points will be awarded as a partial score for passing the test set satisfying |s| ≤ 50.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
s
K

-----Output-----
Print the K-th lexicographically smallest substring of K.

-----Sample Input-----
aba
4

-----Sample Output-----
b

s has five substrings: a, b, ab, ba and aba.
Among them, we should print the fourth smallest one, b.
Note that we do not count a twice.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the K-th lexicographically smallest substring of a given string s. The string s consists of lowercase English letters. The problem states that s has at least K different substrings.

To solve this problem, you need to find the K-th lexicographically smallest substring of s. The problem provides a definition of the lexicographical order of two strings X and Y. If X is lexicographically larger than Y, then Y is a prefix of X or x_j > y_j where j is the smallest integer such that x_j ≠ y_j.

To find the K-th lexicographically smallest substring of s, you can follow these steps:

1. Find all the substrings of s.
2. Sort the substrings in lexicographical order.
3. Print the K-th substring in the sorted list.

Note that the problem states that s has at least K different substrings. Therefore, you can be sure that there are at least K substrings in the sorted list. Therefore, you can safely print the K-th substring in the sorted list.

There is a rectangle in the xy-plane, with its lower left corner at (0, 0) and its upper right corner at (W, H). Each of its sides is parallel to the x-axis or y-axis. Initially, the whole region within the rectangle is painted white.
Snuke plotted N points into the rectangle. The coordinate of the i-th (1 ≦ i ≦ N) point was (x_i, y_i).
Then, he created an integer sequence a of length N, and for each 1 ≦ i ≦ N, he painted some region within the rectangle black, as follows:
 - If a_i = 1, he painted the region satisfying x < x_i within the rectangle.

The problem is asking us to find the area of the white region within a rectangle after Snuke has painted some regions within it. The rectangle has its lower left corner at (0, 0) and its upper right corner at (W, H). Each of its sides is parallel to the x-axis or y-axis.

Snuke has plotted N points into the rectangle. The coordinate of the i-th point was (x_i, y_i).

Then, he created an integer sequence a of length N, and for each 1 ≦ i ≦ N, he painted some region within the rectangle black, as follows:

A railroad running from west to east in Atcoder Kingdom is now complete.
There are N stations on the railroad, numbered 1 through N from west to east.
Tomorrow, the opening ceremony of the railroad will take place.
On this railroad, for each integer i such that 1≤i≤N-1, there will be trains that run from Station i to Station i+1 in C_i seconds. No other trains will be operated.
The first train from Station i to Station i+1 will depart Station i S_i seconds after the ceremony begins. Thereafter, there will be a train that departs Station i every F_i seconds.
Here, it is guaranteed that F_i divides S_i.
That is, for each Time t satisfying S_i≤t and t％F_i=0, there will be a train that departs Station i t seconds after the ceremony begins and arrives at Station i+1 t+C_i seconds after the ceremony begins, where A％B denotes A modulo B, and there will be no other trains.

The problem is asking us to find the earliest possible time we can reach Station N if we are at Station i when the ceremony begins, ignoring the time needed to change trains.

To solve this problem, we need to find the earliest time we can reach Station N from Station i, and then print that time.

Let's consider the case where we are at Station i and we want to reach Station N. We can do this by taking the trains that run from Station i to Station i+1, and then taking the trains that run from Station i+1 to Station N.

The time we need to take the trains from Station i to Station i+1 is C_i seconds. The time we need to take the trains from Station i+1 to Station N is C_i+1 seconds.

There is an image with a height of H pixels and a width of W pixels. Each of the pixels is represented by either . or *. The character representing the pixel at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left, is denoted by C_{i,j}.
Extend this image vertically so that its height is doubled. That is, print a image with a height of 2H pixels and a width of W pixels where the pixel at the i-th row and j-th column is equal to C_{(i+1)/2,j} (the result of division is rounded down).

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

The problem is to extend an image with a height of H pixels and a width of W pixels, where each pixel is represented by either. or *. The extended image should have a height of 2H pixels and a width of W pixels, where each pixel is represented by the result of dividing the row index by 2.

To solve this problem, we can start by reading the input from Standard Input. The first line contains the height and width of the original image, separated by a space. The next H lines contain the pixels of the original image, with each line representing a row of pixels.

We can then create a new image with a height of 2H pixels and a width of W pixels, where each pixel is represented by the result of dividing the row index by 2. We can do this by creating a new 2D array of characters, where each element in the array represents a pixel in the extended image.

To fill in the pixels of the extended image, we can use the following formula:

C_{(i+1)/2,j} = C_{i,j}

This formula simply takes the original pixel value at the i-th row and j-th column,

-----Sample Output-----

The elements are pairwise distinct.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking us to determine if a sequence of integers is pairwise distinct. In other words, we need to check if there are any two elements in the sequence that are equal to each other.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can iterate through the sequence and keep track of the elements we have seen so far. If we see an element that is already in the sequence, we know that it is not pairwise distinct, so we can print NO and stop. If we reach the end of the sequence without finding any duplicates, we know that the sequence is pairwise distinct, so we can print YES.

Here is an example of how we might solve this problem:
```
sequence = [2, 6, 1, 4, 5]

for i in range(len(sequence)):
    if sequence[i] in sequence[:i]:
        print("NO")
        break
else:

There are $n$ people who want to participate in a boat competition. The weight of the $i$-th participant is $w_i$. Only teams consisting of two people can participate in this competition. As an organizer, you think that it's fair to allow only teams with the same total weight.

So, if there are $k$ teams $(a_1, b_1)$, $(a_2, b_2)$, $\dots$, $(a_k, b_k)$, where $a_i$ is the weight of the first participant of the $i$-th team and $b_i$ is the weight of the second participant of the $i$-th team, then the condition $a_1 + b_1 = a_2 + b_2 = \dots = a_k + b_k = s$, where $s$ is the total weight of each team, should be satisfied.

Your task is to choose such $s$ that the number of teams people can create is the maximum possible. Note that each participant can be in no more than one team.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 50$) — the number of participants. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$ ($1 \le w_i \le n$), where $w_i$ is the weight of the $i$-th participant.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print one integer $k$: the maximum number of teams people can compose with the total weight $s$, if you choose $s$ optimally.

Output

-----Note-----

In the first test case of the example, we can reach the optimal answer for $s=6$. Then the first boat is used by participants $1$ and $5$ and the second boat is used by participants $2$ and $4$ (indices are the same as weights).

In the second test case of the example, we can reach the optimal answer for $s=12$. Then first $6$ participants can form $3$ pairs.

In the third test case of the example, we can reach the optimal answer for $s=3$. The answer is $4$ because we have $4$ participants with weight $1$ and $4$ participants with weight $2$.

In the fourth test case of the example, we can reach the optimal answer for $s=4$ or $s=6$.

In the fifth test case of the example, we can reach the optimal answer for $s=3$. Note that participant with weight $3$ can't use the boat because there is no suitable pair for him in the list.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum number of teams that can be formed with the given weights, such that the total weight of each team is the same. The solution is to find the maximum value of $s$ that satisfies the condition $a_1 + b_1 = a_2 + b_2 = \dots = a_k + b_k = s$, where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are the weights of the first and second participants of the $i$-th team, respectively.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by sorting the weights in non-decreasing order. Then, we iterate through the weights and form teams of two participants. We keep track of the total weight of each team and the number of teams formed. When we form a team, we check if the total weight of the team is equal to the current maximum value of $s$. If it is, we update the maximum value of $s$ and the number of teams formed. If it is not, we continue iterating through the weights until we form a team with the total weight equal to the current maximum value of $s$.

The time complexity of this algorithm is $

There is only one entrance in Petya's house and the distribution of apartments is the following: the first floor contains $2$ apartments, every other floor contains $x$ apartments each. Apartments are numbered starting from one, from the first floor. I.e. apartments on the first floor have numbers $1$ and $2$, apartments on the second floor have numbers from $3$ to $(x + 2)$, apartments on the third floor have numbers from $(x + 3)$ to $(2 \cdot x + 2)$, and so on.

You want to perform the combo on your opponent in one popular fighting game. The combo is the string $s$ consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters. To perform the combo, you have to press all buttons in the order they appear in $s$. I.e. if $s=$"abca" then you have to press 'a', then 'b', 'c' and 'a' again.

You know that you will spend $m$ wrong tries to perform the combo and during the $i$-th try you will make a mistake right after $p_i$-th button ($1 \le p_i < n$) (i.e. you will press first $p_i$ buttons right and start performing the combo from the beginning). It is guaranteed that during the $m+1$-th try you press all buttons right and finally perform the combo.

I.e. if $s=$"abca", $m=2$ and $p = [1, 3]$ then the sequence of pressed buttons will be 'a' (here you're making a mistake and start performing the combo from the beginning), 'a', 'b', 'c', (here you're making a mistake and start performing the combo from the beginning), 'a' (note that at this point you will not perform the combo because of the mistake), 'b', 'c', 'a'.

Your task is to calculate for each button (letter) the number of times you'll press it.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.

Then $t$ test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of $s$ and the number of tries correspondingly.

The second line of each test case contains the string $s$ consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters.

The third line of each test case contains $m$ integers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m$ ($1 \le p_i < n$) — the number of characters pressed right during the $i$-th try.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ and the sum of $m$ both does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$ ($\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $\sum m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).

It is guaranteed that the answer for each letter does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^9$.

-----Note-----

The first test case is described in the problem statement. Wrong tries are "a", "abc" and the final try is "abca". The number of times you press 'a' is $4$, 'b' is $2$ and 'c' is $2$.

In the second test case, there are five wrong tries: "co", "codeforc", "cod", "co", "codeforce" and the final try is "codeforces". The number of times you press 'c' is $9$, 'd' is $4$, 'e' is $5$, 'f' is $3$, 'o' is $9$, 'r' is $3$ and 's' is $1$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of times each button is pressed during the $m+1$ tries. We can do this by analyzing the sequence of pressed buttons for each try.

Let's consider the first try. If we press all buttons right, then the sequence of pressed buttons will be $s$. If we make a mistake, then the sequence of pressed buttons will be $s$ followed by the first letter of $s$. For example, if $s=$"abca", then the sequence of pressed buttons for the first try will be "a", "a", "b", "c", "a".

Let's consider the second try. If we press all buttons right, then the sequence of pressed buttons will be $s$ followed by the first letter of $s$. If we make a mistake, then the sequence of pressed buttons will be $s$ followed by the first letter of $s$ followed by the first letter of $s$. For example, if $s=$"abca", then the sequence of pressed buttons for the second try will be "a", "a", "b", "c", "a", "a", "b", "c", "a

In one minute each friend independently from other friends can change the position $x$ by $1$ to the left or by $1$ to the right (i.e. set $x := x - 1$ or $x := x + 1$) or even don't change it.

Let's introduce the total pairwise distance — the sum of distances between each pair of friends. Let $a'$, $b'$ and $c'$ be the final positions of the first, the second and the third friend, correspondingly. Then the total pairwise distance is $|a' - b'| + |a' - c'| + |b' - c'|$, where $|x|$ is the absolute value of $x$.

Friends are interested in the minimum total pairwise distance they can reach if they will move optimally. Each friend will move no more than once. So, more formally, they want to know the minimum total pairwise distance they can reach after one minute.

You have to answer $q$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 1000$) — the number of test cases.

The next $q$ lines describe test cases. The $i$-th test case is given as three integers $a, b$ and $c$ ($1 \le a, b, c \le 10^9$) — initial positions of the first, second and third friend correspondingly. The positions of friends can be equal.


-----Output-----

For each test case print the answer on it — the minimum total pairwise distance (the minimum sum of distances between each pair of friends) if friends change their positions optimally. Each friend will move no more than once. So, more formally, you have to find the minimum total pairwise distance they can reach after one minute.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum total pairwise distance that the three friends can reach if they move optimally. We can do this by considering all possible combinations of moves for each friend.

Let's consider the first friend. They can move either left or right by 1 unit. So, the total pairwise distance for the first friend is |a - b| + |a - c| + |b - c|.

Similarly, we can consider the second and third friends. They can move either left or right by 1 unit. So, the total pairwise distance for the second and third friends is |b - c| + |a - b| + |a - c|.

Now, we need to find the minimum total pairwise distance that the three friends can reach if they move optimally. We can do this by considering all possible combinations of moves for each friend.

Let's consider the first friend. They can move either left or right by 1 unit. So, the total pairwise distance for the first friend is |a - b| + |a - c| + |b - c|.

We call two numbers $x$ and $y$ similar if they have the same parity (the same remainder when divided by $2$), or if $|x-y|=1$. For example, in each of the pairs $(2, 6)$, $(4, 3)$, $(11, 7)$, the numbers are similar to each other, and in the pairs $(1, 4)$, $(3, 12)$, they are not.

You are given an array $a$ of $n$ ($n$ is even) positive integers. Check if there is such a partition of the array into pairs that each element of the array belongs to exactly one pair and the numbers in each pair are similar to each other.

For example, for the array $a = [11, 14, 16, 12]$, there is a partition into pairs $(11, 12)$ and $(14, 16)$. The numbers in the first pair are similar because they differ by one, and in the second pair because they are both even.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

Each test case consists of two lines.

The first line contains an even positive integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 50$) — length of array $a$.

The second line contains $n$ positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$).


-----Output-----

For each test case print:  YES if the such a partition exists,  NO otherwise. 

The letters in the words YES and NO can be displayed in any case.

-----Note-----

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, the two given numbers are not similar.

In the third test case, any partition is suitable.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find a way to partition the array into pairs such that each element of the array belongs to exactly one pair and the numbers in each pair are similar to each other.

We can start by checking if there is a pair of numbers in the array that are similar to each other. We can do this by checking if there is a pair of numbers that have the same parity (the same remainder when divided by 2) or if there is a pair of numbers that differ by 1.

If we find a pair of similar numbers, we can continue to check if there are any other pairs of numbers in the array that are similar to each other. If we find a pair of numbers that are not similar to each other, we can return "NO" immediately.

If we do not find any pairs of numbers that are not similar to each other, we can continue to check if there are any pairs of numbers that are similar to each other. If we find a pair of numbers that are similar to each other, we can continue to check if there are any other pairs of numbers in the array that are similar to each other.

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
You are a mayor of Berlyatov. There are $n$ districts and $m$ two-way roads between them. The $i$-th road connects districts $x_i$ and $y_i$. The cost of travelling along this road is $w_i$. There is some path between each pair of districts, so the city is connected.

There are $k$ delivery routes in Berlyatov. The $i$-th route is going from the district $a_i$ to the district $b_i$. There is one courier on each route and the courier will always choose the cheapest (minimum by total cost) path from the district $a_i$ to the district $b_i$ to deliver products.

The route can go from the district to itself, some couriers routes can coincide (and you have to count them independently).

You can make at most one road to have cost zero (i.e. you choose at most one road and change its cost with $0$).

Let $d(x, y)$ be the cheapest cost of travel between districts $x$ and $y$.

Your task is to find the minimum total courier routes cost you can achieve, if you optimally select the some road and change its cost with $0$. In other words, you have to find the minimum possible value of $\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{k} d(a_i, b_i)$ after applying the operation described above optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($2 \le n \le 1000$; $n - 1 \le m \le min(1000, \frac{n(n-1)}{2})$; $1 \le k \le 1000$) — the number of districts, the number of roads and the number of courier routes.

The next $m$ lines describe roads. The $i$-th road is given as three integers $x_i$, $y_i$ and $w_i$ ($1 \le x_i, y_i \le n$; $x_i \ne y_i$; $1 \le w_i \le 1000$), where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are districts the $i$-th road connects and $w_i$ is its cost. It is guaranteed that there is some path between each pair of districts, so the city is connected. It is also guaranteed that there is at most one road between each pair of districts.

The next $k$ lines describe courier routes. The $i$-th route is given as two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$) — the districts of the $i$-th route. The route can go from the district to itself, some couriers routes can coincide (and you have to count them independently).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum total courier routes cost you can achieve (i.e. the minimum value $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k} d(a_i, b_i)$, where $d(x, y)$ is the cheapest cost of travel between districts $x$ and $y$) if you can make some (at most one) road cost zero.

There, you can choose either the road $(2, 4)$ or the road $(4, 6)$. Both options lead to the total cost $22$.

The picture corresponding to the second example:

$A$

There, you can choose the road $(3, 4)$. This leads to the total cost $13$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum total cost of courier routes if we can make at most one road cost zero. The key insight is that we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.

Let $d(x, y)$ be the cheapest cost of travel between districts $x$ and $y$. We can compute $d(x, y)$ using the following recurrence relation:

$$d(x, y) = \min\limits_{i = 1}^m (w_i + d(x_i, y_i))$$

where $w_i$ is the cost of the $i$-th road and $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the districts connected by the $i$-th road.

We can compute $d(x, y)$ for all pairs of districts $x$ and $y$ using the recurrence relation above.

Now, let's consider the operation of making a road cost zero. If we make a road cost zero, then we can reduce the total cost of the courier routes by the cost of the road. Specifically, we can reduce the total cost of the courier routes by $w_i$

The only difference between easy and hard versions is the maximum value of $n$.

You are given a positive integer number $n$. You really love good numbers so you want to find the smallest good number greater than or equal to $n$.

The positive integer is called good if it can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of $3$ (i.e. no duplicates of powers of $3$ are allowed).

For example:  $30$ is a good number: $30 = 3^3 + 3^1$,  $1$ is a good number: $1 = 3^0$,  $12$ is a good number: $12 = 3^2 + 3^1$,  but $2$ is not a good number: you can't represent it as a sum of distinct powers of $3$ ($2 = 3^0 + 3^0$),  $19$ is not a good number: you can't represent it as a sum of distinct powers of $3$ (for example, the representations $19 = 3^2 + 3^2 + 3^0 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^1 + 3^1 + 3^0$ are invalid),  $20$ is also not a good number: you can't represent it as a sum of distinct powers of $3$ (for example, the representation $20 = 3^2 + 3^2 + 3^0 + 3^0$ is invalid). 

Note, that there exist other representations of $19$ and $20$ as sums of powers of $3$ but none of them consists of distinct powers of $3$.

For the given positive integer $n$ find such smallest $m$ ($n \le m$) that $m$ is a good number.

You have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$) — the number of queries. Then $q$ queries follow.

The only line of the query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^4$).

For each query, print such smallest integer $m$ (where $n \le m$) that $m$ is a good number.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the smallest good number greater than or equal to $n$. A good number is a number that can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 3. For example, 30 is a good number because it can be represented as 3^3 + 3^1.

To solve this problem, you can use a simple algorithm that checks if a number is a good number by trying to represent it as a sum of distinct powers of 3. If a number is not a good number, you can increment it by 1 until you find a good number.

Here is an example of how you can solve this problem:

1. For each query, read the input integer $n$.
2. Initialize a variable $m$ to $n$.
3. While $m$ is not a good number, increment $m$ by 1.
4. Print $m$ as the answer.

For example, if the input is 13, the algorithm will increment 13 by 1 to get 14, which is a good number. Then it will print 14 as the answer.

Note that this algorithm will work for all

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

There are $n$ kids, each of them is reading a unique book. At the end of any day, the $i$-th kid will give his book to the $p_i$-th kid (in case of $i = p_i$ the kid will give his book to himself). It is guaranteed that all values of $p_i$ are distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ (i.e. $p$ is a permutation). The sequence $p$ doesn't change from day to day, it is fixed.

For example, if $n=6$ and $p=[4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 2]$ then at the end of the first day the book of the $1$-st kid will belong to the $4$-th kid, the $2$-nd kid will belong to the $6$-th kid and so on. At the end of the second day the book of the $1$-st kid will belong to the $3$-th kid, the $2$-nd kid will belong to the $2$-th kid and so on.

Your task is to determine the number of the day the book of the $i$-th child is returned back to him for the first time for every $i$ from $1$ to $n$.

Consider the following example: $p = [5, 1, 2, 4, 3]$. The book of the $1$-st kid will be passed to the following kids:  after the $1$-st day it will belong to the $5$-th kid,  after the $2$-nd day it will belong to the $3$-rd kid,  after the $3$-rd day it will belong to the $2$-nd kid,  after the $4$-th day it will belong to the $1$-st kid. 

So after the fourth day, the book of the first kid will return to its owner. The book of the fourth kid will return to him for the first time after exactly one day.

You have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 1000$) — the number of queries. Then $q$ queries follow.

The first line of the query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of kids in the query. The second line of the query contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$, all $p_i$ are distinct, i.e. $p$ is a permutation), where $p_i$ is the kid which will get the book of the $i$-th kid.

It is guaranteed that $\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$ (sum of $n$ over all queries does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$).


-----Output-----

For each query, print the answer on it: $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, where $a_i$ is the number of the day the book of the $i$-th child is returned back to him for the first time in this query.

The problem is asking us to find the day on which each kid will receive their book back for the first time. We can solve this problem by using a hash table to keep track of the day on which each kid received their book back for the first time.

We start by initializing the hash table with $n$ slots, where $n$ is the number of kids. We then iterate through each day, and for each kid, we check if they have received their book back for the first time. If they have not, we add the day to the hash table. If they have, we do not add anything to the hash table.

After we have iterated through all the days, we can print the values in the hash table as the answer.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize the hash table with $n$ slots.
2. Iterate through each day.
3. For each kid, check if they have received their book back for the first time. If they have not, add the day to the hash table. If they have, do not add anything to the hash table.
4. After iterating through all the days

There are $n$ Christmas trees on an infinite number line. The $i$-th tree grows at the position $x_i$. All $x_i$ are guaranteed to be distinct.

Each integer point can be either occupied by the Christmas tree, by the human or not occupied at all. Non-integer points cannot be occupied by anything.

There are $m$ people who want to celebrate Christmas. Let $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m$ be the positions of people (note that all values $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n, y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m$ should be distinct and all $y_j$ should be integer). You want to find such an arrangement of people that the value $\sum\limits_{j=1}^{m}\min\limits_{i=1}^{n}|x_i - y_j|$ is the minimum possible (in other words, the sum of distances to the nearest Christmas tree for all people should be minimized).

In other words, let $d_j$ be the distance from the $j$-th human to the nearest Christmas tree ($d_j = \min\limits_{i=1}^{n} |y_j - x_i|$). Then you need to choose such positions $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m$ that $\sum\limits_{j=1}^{m} d_j$ is the minimum possible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of Christmas trees and the number of people.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ ($-10^9 \le x_i \le 10^9$), where $x_i$ is the position of the $i$-th Christmas tree. It is guaranteed that all $x_i$ are distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print one integer $res$ — the minimum possible value of $\sum\limits_{j=1}^{m}\min\limits_{i=1}^{n}|x_i - y_j|$ (in other words, the sum of distances to the nearest Christmas tree for all people).

In the second line print $m$ integers $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m$ ($-2 \cdot 10^9 \le y_j \le 2 \cdot 10^9$), where $y_j$ is the position of the $j$-th human. All $y_j$ should be distinct and all values $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n, y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m$ should be distinct.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the optimal placement of $m$ people on an infinite number line such that the sum of the distances to the nearest Christmas tree is minimized.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by placing the first person at position $0$. Then, we place the second person at position $1$. We continue placing people at positions $2, 3, 4, \ldots$ until we have placed all $m$ people.

At each step, we choose the position that is closest to the nearest Christmas tree. If there are multiple positions that are equally close to the nearest Christmas tree, we choose the position that is closest to the position of the previous person.

For example, suppose we have $n=3$ Christmas trees at positions $x_1=1, x_2=5, x_3=8$. We want to place $m=5$ people on the number line. We place the first person at position $0$. Then, we place the second person at position $1$. The third person is placed at position $2$. The fourth person is placed at position $3$. The fifth person is placed at position $4$.

There is a robot in a warehouse and $n$ packages he wants to collect. The warehouse can be represented as a coordinate grid. Initially, the robot stays at the point $(0, 0)$. The $i$-th package is at the point $(x_i, y_i)$. It is guaranteed that there are no two packages at the same point. It is also guaranteed that the point $(0, 0)$ doesn't contain a package.

The robot is semi-broken and only can move up ('U') and right ('R'). In other words, in one move the robot can go from the point $(x, y)$ to the point ($x + 1, y$) or to the point $(x, y + 1)$.

As we say above, the robot wants to collect all $n$ packages (in arbitrary order). He wants to do it with the minimum possible number of moves. If there are several possible traversals, the robot wants to choose the lexicographically smallest path.

The string $s$ of length $n$ is lexicographically less than the string $t$ of length $n$ if there is some index $1 \le j \le n$ that for all $i$ from $1$ to $j-1$ $s_i = t_i$ and $s_j < t_j$. It is the standard comparison of string, like in a dictionary. Most programming languages compare strings in this way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. Then test cases follow.

The first line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of packages.

The next $n$ lines contain descriptions of packages. The $i$-th package is given as two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($0 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000$) — the $x$-coordinate of the package and the $y$-coordinate of the package.

It is guaranteed that there are no two packages at the same point. It is also guaranteed that the point $(0, 0)$ doesn't contain a package.

The sum of all values $n$ over test cases in the test doesn't exceed $1000$.


-----Output-----

Print the answer for each test case.

If it is impossible to collect all $n$ packages in some order starting from ($0,0$), print "NO" on the first line.

Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line. Then print the shortest path — a string consisting of characters 'R' and 'U'. Among all such paths choose the lexicographically smallest path.

Note that in this problem "YES" and "NO" can be only uppercase words, i.e. "Yes", "no" and "YeS" are not acceptable.

-----Note-----

For the first test case in the example the optimal path RUUURRRRUU is shown below:  [Image]

-----Plan-----
In this problem, we need to find the shortest path for the robot to collect all the packages in the warehouse. The robot can only move up or right, and it wants to collect all the packages in the minimum number of moves.

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dynamic Programming (DP).

1. BFS: We can use BFS to explore all the possible paths that the robot can take to collect all the packages. We can start from the point $(0, 0)$ and explore all the possible paths that the robot can take to reach each package. We can use a queue to keep track of the packages that the robot needs to collect.
2. DP: We can use DP to keep track of the minimum number of moves that the robot needs to take to collect all the packages. We can use a 2D array to store the minimum number of moves for each package. We can initialize the array with the maximum value, and then update it as we explore the possible paths.

Once we have explored all the possible paths, we can use the 2D array to find the minimum number of moves that

If $d > s$, then we need to make $d - s$ moves. In each move, we can increase $n$ by one, which means we can add $1$ to $n$.

So, the minimum number of moves we need to perform is $d - s$.

Let's look at an example. Suppose $n = 217871987498122$ and $s = 10$. We can find the sum of the digits of $n$ by adding up all the digits:

2 + 1 + 7 + 8 + 7 + 1 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 9 + 8 + 1 + 2

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
There is a bookshelf which can fit $n$ books. The $i$-th position of bookshelf is $a_i = 1$ if there is a book on this position and $a_i = 0$ otherwise. It is guaranteed that there is at least one book on the bookshelf.

In one move, you can choose some contiguous segment $[l; r]$ consisting of books (i.e. for each $i$ from $l$ to $r$ the condition $a_i = 1$ holds) and:  Shift it to the right by $1$: move the book at index $i$ to $i + 1$ for all $l \le i \le r$. This move can be done only if $r+1 \le n$ and there is no book at the position $r+1$.  Shift it to the left by $1$: move the book at index $i$ to $i-1$ for all $l \le i \le r$. This move can be done only if $l-1 \ge 1$ and there is no book at the position $l-1$. 

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to collect all the books on the shelf as a contiguous (consecutive) segment (i.e. the segment without any gaps).

For example, for $a = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]$ there is a gap between books ($a_4 = 0$ when $a_3 = 1$ and $a_5 = 1$), for $a = [1, 1, 0]$ there are no gaps between books and for $a = [0, 0,0]$ there are also no gaps between books.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 200$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 50$) — the number of places on a bookshelf. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 1$), where $a_i$ is $1$ if there is a book at this position and $0$ otherwise. It is guaranteed that there is at least one book on the bookshelf.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum number of moves required to collect all the books on the shelf as a contiguous (consecutive) segment (i.e. the segment without gaps).

-----Note-----

In the first test case of the example, you can shift the segment $[3; 3]$ to the right and the segment $[4; 5]$ to the right. After all moves, the books form the contiguous segment $[5; 7]$. So the answer is $2$.

In the second test case of the example, you have nothing to do, all the books on the bookshelf form the contiguous segment already.

In the third test case of the example, you can shift the segment $[5; 5]$ to the left and then the segment $[4; 4]$ to the left again. After all moves, the books form the contiguous segment $[1; 3]$. So the answer is $2$.

In the fourth test case of the example, you can shift the segment $[1; 1]$ to the right, the segment $[2; 2]$ to the right, the segment $[6; 6]$ to the left and then the segment $[5; 5]$ to the left. After all moves, the books form the contiguous segment $[3; 4]$. So the answer is $4$.

In the fifth test case of the example, you can shift the segment $[1; 2]$ to the right. After all moves, the books form the contiguous segment $[2; 5]$. So the answer is $1$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum number of moves required to collect all the books on the shelf as a contiguous (consecutive) segment. The move can be either shifting the segment to the right by 1 or shifting the segment to the left by 1.

The solution is to find the minimum number of moves required to collect all the books on the shelf as a contiguous (consecutive) segment. The move can be either shifting the segment to the right by 1 or shifting the segment to the left by 1.

You are given two integers $n$ and $k$.

Your task is to construct such a string $s$ of length $n$ that for each $i$ from $1$ to $k$ there is at least one $i$-th letter of the Latin alphabet in this string (the first letter is 'a', the second is 'b' and so on) and there are no other letters except these. You have to maximize the minimal frequency of some letter (the frequency of a letter is the number of occurrences of this letter in a string). If there are several possible answers, you can print any.

You have to answer $t$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of queries.

The next $t$ lines are contain queries, one per line. The $i$-th line contains two integers $n_i$ and $k_i$ ($1 \le n_i \le 100, 1 \le k_i \le min(n_i, 26)$) — the length of the string in the $i$-th query and the number of characters in the $i$-th query.


-----Output-----

Print $t$ lines. In the $i$-th line print the answer to the $i$-th query: any string $s_i$ satisfying the conditions in the problem statement with constraints from the $i$-th query.


-----Example-----
Input
3
7 3
4 4
6 2

Output
cbcacab
abcd
baabab



-----Note-----

In the first example query the maximum possible minimal frequency is $2$, it can be easily seen that the better answer doesn't exist. Other examples of correct answers: "cbcabba", "ccbbaaa" (any permutation of given answers is also correct).

In the second example query any permutation of first four letters is acceptable (the maximum minimal frequency is $1$).

In the third example query any permutation of the given answer is acceptable (the maximum minimal frequency is $3$).

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to construct a string of length $n$ that contains at least one letter of the Latin alphabet for each of the first $k$ letters of the alphabet. We can do this by using the first $k$ letters of the alphabet as the characters of the string.

For example, if $n = 7$ and $k = 3$, we can construct the string "cbcacab" by using the first three letters of the alphabet, "c", "b", and "a". This string satisfies the conditions of the problem, as it contains at least one "c", "b", and "a" for each of the first three letters of the alphabet.

To maximize the minimal frequency of some letter, we can use the first letter of the alphabet as the most frequent letter. This will ensure that the minimal frequency of each letter is at least 1, and the maximal frequency of each letter is at most $k$.

For example, if $n = 7$ and $k = 3$, we can construct the string "ccbbaaa" by using the first three letters of the alphabet, "c", "b", and "a". This string

There are $n$ candies in a row, they are numbered from left to right from $1$ to $n$. The size of the $i$-th candy is $a_i$.

Alice and Bob play an interesting and tasty game: they eat candy. Alice will eat candy from left to right, and Bob — from right to left. The game ends if all the candies are eaten.

The process consists of moves. During a move, the player eats one or more sweets from her/his side (Alice eats from the left, Bob — from the right).

Alice makes the first move. During the first move, she will eat $1$ candy (its size is $a_1$). Then, each successive move the players alternate — that is, Bob makes the second move, then Alice, then again Bob and so on.

On each move, a player counts the total size of candies eaten during the current move. Once this number becomes strictly greater than the total size of candies eaten by the other player on their previous move, the current player stops eating and the move ends. In other words, on a move, a player eats the smallest possible number of candies such that the sum of the sizes of candies eaten on this move is strictly greater than the sum of the sizes of candies that the other player ate on the previous move. If there are not enough candies to make a move this way, then the player eats up all the remaining candies and the game ends.

For example, if $n=11$ and $a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5]$, then:  move 1: Alice eats one candy of size $3$ and the sequence of candies becomes $[1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5]$.  move 2: Alice ate $3$ on the previous move, which means Bob must eat $4$ or more. Bob eats one candy of size $5$ and the sequence of candies becomes $[1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3]$.  move 3: Bob ate $5$ on the previous move, which means Alice must eat $6$ or more. Alice eats three candies with the total size of $1+4+1=6$ and the sequence of candies becomes $[5,9,2,6,5,3]$.  move 4: Alice ate $6$ on the previous move, which means Bob must eat $7$ or more. Bob eats two candies with the total size of $3+5=8$ and the sequence of candies becomes $[5,9,2,6]$.  move 5: Bob ate $8$ on the previous move, which means Alice must eat $9$ or more. Alice eats two candies with the total size of $5+9=14$ and the sequence of candies becomes $[2,6]$.  move 6 (the last): Alice ate $14$ on the previous move, which means Bob must eat $15$ or more. It is impossible, so Bob eats the two remaining candies and the game ends. 

Print the number of moves in the game and two numbers:  $a$ — the total size of all sweets eaten by Alice during the game;  $b$ — the total size of all sweets eaten by Bob during the game. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 5000$) — the number of test cases in the input. The following are descriptions of the $t$ test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of candies. The second line contains a sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 1000$) — the sizes of candies in the order they are arranged from left to right.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $n$ for all sets of input data in a test does not exceed $2\cdot10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each set of input data print three integers — the number of moves in the game and the required values $a$ and $b$.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves required for Alice and Bob to eat all the candies. We can do this by analyzing the game and finding the optimal strategy for each player.

Let's first consider the game from Alice's perspective. On her first move, she can eat one candy of size $a_1$. On her second move, she can eat at most $a_2 - a_1$ candies, since she must eat at least one candy and the total size of candies eaten on her previous move was $a_1$. On her third move, she can eat at most $a_3 - a_2$ candies, and so on.

The total size of candies eaten by Alice on her $i$th move is $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_i$. To find the minimum number of moves required for Alice to eat all the candies, we need to find the smallest $i$ such that $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_i > a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{i-1}$. This is equivalent to finding

You are given two arrays $a$ and $b$ both consisting of $n$ positive (greater than zero) integers. You are also given an integer $k$.

In one move, you can choose two indices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \le i, j \le n$) and swap $a_i$ and $b_j$ (i.e. $a_i$ becomes $b_j$ and vice versa). Note that $i$ and $j$ can be equal or different (in particular, swap $a_2$ with $b_2$ or swap $a_3$ and $b_9$ both are acceptable moves).

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum you can obtain in the array $a$ if you can do no more than (i.e. at most) $k$ such moves (swaps).

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 200$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 30; 0 \le k \le n$) — the number of elements in $a$ and $b$ and the maximum number of moves you can do. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 30$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$. The third line of the test case contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$ ($1 \le b_i \le 30$), where $b_i$ is the $i$-th element of $b$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer — the maximum possible sum you can obtain in the array $a$ if you can do no more than (i.e. at most) $k$ swaps.

-----Note-----

In the first test case of the example, you can swap $a_1 = 1$ and $b_2 = 4$, so $a=[4, 2]$ and $b=[3, 1]$.

In the second test case of the example, you don't need to swap anything.

In the third test case of the example, you can swap $a_1 = 1$ and $b_1 = 10$, $a_3 = 3$ and $b_3 = 10$ and $a_2 = 2$ and $b_4 = 10$, so $a=[10, 10, 10, 4, 5]$ and $b=[1, 9, 3, 2, 9]$.

In the fourth test case of the example, you cannot swap anything.

In the fifth test case of the example, you can swap arrays $a$ and $b$, so $a=[4, 4, 5, 4]$ and $b=[1, 2, 2, 1]$.

-----Plan-----
This problem is a classic example of the "maximum sum problem" in dynamic programming. The idea is to find the maximum sum of the elements in the array $a$ by considering all possible swaps of elements between $a$ and $b$.

To solve this problem, we can use a two-dimensional array $dp$ to store the maximum sum of the elements in $a$ for each possible number of swaps. The $dp[i][j]$ represents the maximum sum of the elements in $a$ for $j$ swaps, where $i$ is the number of elements in $a$ and $j$ is the number of swaps.

We can fill the $dp$ array in a bottom-up manner, starting from the base case where $j=0$ (i.e., no swaps). For each $j$, we can calculate the maximum sum of the elements in $a$ for $j$ swaps by considering all possible swaps of elements between $a$ and $b$. We can use the following recurrence relation to fill the $dp$ array:

$$dp[i][j] = \max\left(dp[i-1][j-

You are planning to buy an apartment in a $n$-floor building. The floors are numbered from $1$ to $n$ from the bottom to the top. At first for each floor you want to know the minimum total time to reach it from the first (the bottom) floor.

Let:  $a_i$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $n-1$ be the time required to go from the $i$-th floor to the $(i+1)$-th one (and from the $(i+1)$-th to the $i$-th as well) using the stairs;  $b_i$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $n-1$ be the time required to go from the $i$-th floor to the $(i+1)$-th one (and from the $(i+1)$-th to the $i$-th as well) using the elevator, also there is a value $c$ — time overhead for elevator usage (you need to wait for it, the elevator doors are too slow!). 

In one move, you can go from the floor you are staying at $x$ to any floor $y$ ($x \ne y$) in two different ways:  If you are using the stairs, just sum up the corresponding values of $a_i$. Formally, it will take $\sum\limits_{i=min(x, y)}^{max(x, y) - 1} a_i$ time units.  If you are using the elevator, just sum up $c$ and the corresponding values of $b_i$. Formally, it will take $c + \sum\limits_{i=min(x, y)}^{max(x, y) - 1} b_i$ time units. 

You can perform as many moves as you want (possibly zero).

So your task is for each $i$ to determine the minimum total time it takes to reach the $i$-th floor from the $1$-st (bottom) floor.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $c$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le c \le 1000$) — the number of floors in the building and the time overhead for the elevator rides.

The second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{n-1}$ ($1 \le a_i \le 1000$), where $a_i$ is the time required to go from the $i$-th floor to the $(i+1)$-th one (and from the $(i+1)$-th to the $i$-th as well) using the stairs.

The third line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_{n-1}$ ($1 \le b_i \le 1000$), where $b_i$ is the time required to go from the $i$-th floor to the $(i+1)$-th one (and from the $(i+1)$-th to the $i$-th as well) using the elevator.


-----Output-----

Print $n$ integers $t_1, t_2, \dots, t_n$, where $t_i$ is the minimum total time to reach the $i$-th floor from the first floor if you can perform as many moves as you want.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the minimum time required to reach each floor of a building with $n$ floors, where the time to reach a floor using the stairs is given by $a_i$ and the time to reach a floor using the elevator is given by $b_i$. The time overhead for the elevator is $c$.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array $dp$ where $dp[i][j]$ represents the minimum time required to reach floor $j$ from floor $i$. We can initialize $dp[i][i] = 0$ for all $i$ and $dp[i][j] = \infty$ for all $i \ne j$.

We can then fill in the values of $dp$ using the following recurrence relation:

$$dp[i][j] = \min\left(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + a_k + b_j\right)$$

$$dp[i][j] = \min\left(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + c + b_j\right)$$

For the given integer $n$ ($n > 2$) let's write down all the strings of length $n$ which contain $n-2$ letters 'a' and two letters 'b' in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.

Recall that the string $s$ of length $n$ is lexicographically less than string $t$ of length $n$, if there exists such $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$), that $s_i < t_i$, and for any $j$ ($1 \le j < i$) $s_j = t_j$. The lexicographic comparison of strings is implemented by the operator < in modern programming languages.

For example, if $n=5$ the strings are (the order does matter):  aaabb  aabab  aabba  abaab  ababa  abbaa  baaab  baaba  babaa  bbaaa 

It is easy to show that such a list of strings will contain exactly $\frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2}$ strings.

You are given $n$ ($n > 2$) and $k$ ($1 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2}$). Print the $k$-th string from the list.


-----Input-----

The input contains one or more test cases.

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases in the test. Then $t$ test cases follow.

Each test case is written on the the separate line containing two integers $n$ and $k$ ($3 \le n \le 10^5, 1 \le k \le \min(2\cdot10^9, \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2})$.

The sum of values $n$ over all test cases in the test doesn't exceed $10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case print the $k$-th string from the list of all described above strings of length $n$. Strings in the list are sorted lexicographically (alphabetically).

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to generate all possible strings of length $n$ that contain $n-2$ letters 'a' and two letters 'b' in lexicographical order. We can do this by generating all possible strings of length $n-2$ that contain $n-2$ letters 'a' and then adding two letters 'b' to the end of each string.

We can generate all possible strings of length $n-2$ by starting with the empty string and then adding the letters 'a' one at a time. We can do this by creating a list of all possible strings of length $n-2$ that contain $n-2$ letters 'a'.

Once we have the list of all possible strings of length $n-2$ that contain $n-2$ letters 'a', we can add two letters 'b' to the end of each string to get the list of all possible strings of length $n$ that contain $n-2$ letters 'a' and two letters 'b'.

To print the $k$-th string from the list, we can simply print the $k$-th string in the list.

There are $n$ points on a plane. The $i$-th point has coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$. You have two horizontal platforms, both of length $k$. Each platform can be placed anywhere on a plane but it should be placed horizontally (on the same $y$-coordinate) and have integer borders. If the left border of the platform is $(x, y)$ then the right border is $(x + k, y)$ and all points between borders (including borders) belong to the platform.

Note that platforms can share common points (overlap) and it is not necessary to place both platforms on the same $y$-coordinate.

When you place both platforms on a plane, all points start falling down decreasing their $y$-coordinate. If a point collides with some platform at some moment, the point stops and is saved. Points which never collide with any platform are lost.

Your task is to find the maximum number of points you can save if you place both platforms optimally.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.

For better understanding, please read the Note section below to see a picture for the first test case.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$; $1 \le k \le 10^9$) — the number of points and the length of each platform, respectively. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ ($1 \le x_i \le 10^9$), where $x_i$ is $x$-coordinate of the $i$-th point. The third line of the input contains $n$ integers $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n$ ($1 \le y_i \le 10^9$), where $y_i$ is $y$-coordinate of the $i$-th point. All points are distinct (there is no pair $1 \le i < j \le n$ such that $x_i = x_j$ and $y_i = y_j$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$ ($\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).

For each test case, print the answer: the maximum number of points you can save if you place both platforms optimally.

[Image]

Blue dots represent the points, red segments represent the platforms. One of the possible ways is to place the first platform between points $(1, -1)$ and $(2, -1)$ and the second one between points $(4, 3)$ and $(5, 3)$. Vectors represent how the points will fall down. As you can see, the only point we can't save is the point $(3, 7)$ so it falls down infinitely and will be lost. It can be proven that we can't achieve better answer here. Also note that the point $(5, 3)$ doesn't fall at all because it is already on the platform.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum number of points that can be saved by placing two platforms on a plane such that all points fall down and collide with the platforms. The platforms are horizontal and have integer borders. The points are placed on a plane and can be on the same $y$-coordinate or not.

To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal placement of the platforms such that the maximum number of points are saved. We can do this by finding the minimum $y$-coordinate of the points that fall on the platforms.

Let's consider the first test case of the example. We have 7 points on the plane, and we need to place two platforms of length 1. The points are placed on the plane as follows:

1. $(1, -1)$
2. $(2, -1)$
3. $(4, 3)$
4. $(5, 3)$
5. $(3, 7)$
6. $(10, 10)$
7. $(15, 19)$

We need to find the minimum $y$-coordinate of the points that fall on the platforms. The minimum $y$-coordinate is 3

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
Recall that MEX of an array is a minimum non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. Examples:  for the array $[0, 0, 1, 0, 2]$ MEX equals to $3$ because numbers $0, 1$ and $2$ are presented in the array and $3$ is the minimum non-negative integer not presented in the array;  for the array $[1, 2, 3, 4]$ MEX equals to $0$ because $0$ is the minimum non-negative integer not presented in the array;  for the array $[0, 1, 4, 3]$ MEX equals to $2$ because $2$ is the minimum non-negative integer not presented in the array. 

You are given an empty array $a=[]$ (in other words, a zero-length array). You are also given a positive integer $x$.

You are also given $q$ queries. The $j$-th query consists of one integer $y_j$ and means that you have to append one element $y_j$ to the array. The array length increases by $1$ after a query.

In one move, you can choose any index $i$ and set $a_i := a_i + x$ or $a_i := a_i - x$ (i.e. increase or decrease any element of the array by $x$). The only restriction is that $a_i$ cannot become negative. Since initially the array is empty, you can perform moves only after the first query.

You have to maximize the MEX (minimum excluded) of the array if you can perform any number of such operations (you can even perform the operation multiple times with one element).

You have to find the answer after each of $q$ queries (i.e. the $j$-th answer corresponds to the array of length $j$).

Operations are discarded before each query. I.e. the array $a$ after the $j$-th query equals to $[y_1, y_2, \dots, y_j]$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $q, x$ ($1 \le q, x \le 4 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of queries and the value of $x$.

The next $q$ lines describe queries. The $j$-th query consists of one integer $y_j$ ($0 \le y_j \le 10^9$) and means that you have to append one element $y_j$ to the array.


-----Output-----

Print the answer to the initial problem after each query — for the query $j$ print the maximum value of MEX after first $j$ queries. Note that queries are dependent (the array changes after each query) but operations are independent between queries.

-----Note-----

In the first example:  After the first query, the array is $a=[0]$: you don't need to perform any operations, maximum possible MEX is $1$.  After the second query, the array is $a=[0, 1]$: you don't need to perform any operations, maximum possible MEX is $2$.  After the third query, the array is $a=[0, 1, 2]$: you don't need to perform any operations, maximum possible MEX is $3$.  After the fourth query, the array is $a=[0, 1, 2, 2]$: you don't need to perform any operations, maximum possible MEX is $3$ (you can't make it greater with operations).  After the fifth query, the array is $a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 0]$: you can perform $a[4] := a[4] + 3 = 3$. The array changes to be $a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 3]$. Now MEX is maximum possible and equals to $4$.  After the sixth query, the array is $a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0]$: you can perform $a[4] := a[4] + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3$. The array changes to be $a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0]$. Now MEX is maximum possible and equals to $4$.  After the seventh query, the array is $a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 10]$. You can perform the following operations:   $a[3] := a[3] + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5$,  $a[4] := a[4] + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3$,  $a[5] := a[5] + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3$,  $a[5] := a[5] + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6$,  $a[6] := a[6] - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7$,  $a[6] := a[6] - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4$.  The resulting array will be $a=[0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 6, 4]$. Now MEX is maximum possible and equals to $7$.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum possible MEX (minimum excluded) of an array after a series of queries. The array starts out empty, and each query consists of appending a new element to the array. The goal is to maximize the MEX after the queries are complete.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can keep track of the maximum MEX for each possible length of the array, and update these values as we go through the queries.

Let $M(i, j)$ be the maximum MEX for an array of length $i$ after $j$ queries. We can compute $M(i, j)$ as follows:

* If $i = 0$, then $M(i, j) = 0$. This is because the array is empty, and there is no minimum non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
* If $i > 0$, then $M(i, j) = \max(M(i - 1, j), M(i - 1, j - 1) + x)$. This is because we can either keep the MEX for the array of length $i -

We have a secret array. You don't know this array and you have to restore it. However, you know some facts about this array:

  The array consists of $n$ distinct positive (greater than $0$) integers.  The array contains two elements $x$ and $y$ (these elements are known for you) such that $x < y$.  If you sort the array in increasing order (such that $a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n$), differences between all adjacent (consecutive) elements are equal (i.e. $a_2 - a_1 = a_3 - a_2 = \ldots = a_n - a_{n-1})$. 

It can be proven that such an array always exists under the constraints given below.

Among all possible arrays that satisfy the given conditions, we ask you to restore one which has the minimum possible maximum element. In other words, you have to minimize $\max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)$.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains three integers $n$, $x$ and $y$ ($2 \le n \le 50$; $1 \le x < y \le 50$) — the length of the array and two elements that are present in the array, respectively.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer: $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of the required array. If there are several answers, you can print any (it also means that the order of elements doesn't matter).

It can be proven that such an array always exists under the given constraints.

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find a way to construct an array that satisfies the given conditions.

First, we know that the array consists of $n$ distinct positive integers, and that the array contains two elements $x$ and $y$ such that $x < y$. We also know that if we sort the array in increasing order, the differences between adjacent elements are equal.

To construct the array, we can start by placing $x$ in the first position, and then place the remaining $n-1$ elements in the remaining positions in increasing order. However, this may not be the optimal solution, as it may not minimize the maximum element.

To minimize the maximum element, we can place the elements in the array in a way that maximizes the difference between adjacent elements. This can be done by placing the elements in the following order: $x, x+1, x+2, \ldots, x+n-1, y$. This ensures that the differences between adjacent elements are equal, and also minimizes the maximum element.

Therefore, the solution to the problem is to place the elements in the array in the order $x, x+1, x+2

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers.

In one move, you can choose two indices $1 \le i, j \le n$ such that $i \ne j$ and set $a_i := a_j$. You can perform such moves any number of times (possibly, zero). You can choose different indices in different operations. The operation := is the operation of assignment (i.e. you choose $i$ and $j$ and replace $a_i$ with $a_j$).

Your task is to say if it is possible to obtain an array with an odd (not divisible by $2$) sum of elements.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2000$) — the number of test cases.

The next $2t$ lines describe test cases. The first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2000$) — the number of elements in $a$. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 2000$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2000$ ($\sum n \le 2000$).

In this problem, we are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. We are allowed to perform a certain number of moves, where in each move, we choose two indices $i$ and $j$ such that $i \ne j$ and set $a_i := a_j$. We can perform these moves any number of times.

The problem is to determine if it is possible to obtain an array with an odd sum of elements.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm. We can start by initializing a variable $sum$ to 0. We then iterate through the array $a$, and for each element $a_i$, we add $a_i$ to $sum$. If $sum$ is odd, we return "YES", since we have an odd sum of elements. If $sum$ is even, we continue iterating through the array, and for each element $a_i$, we check if $a_i$ is odd. If any element $a_i$ is odd, we return "YES", since we have an odd sum of elements. If no element $a_i$ is odd, we return "NO", since we have

You are given an array $a[0 \ldots n-1]$ of length $n$ which consists of non-negative integers. Note that array indices start from zero.

An array is called good if the parity of each index matches the parity of the element at that index. More formally, an array is good if for all $i$ ($0 \le i \le n - 1$) the equality $i \bmod 2 = a[i] \bmod 2$ holds, where $x \bmod 2$ is the remainder of dividing $x$ by 2.

For example, the arrays [$0, 5, 2, 1$] and [$0, 17, 0, 3$] are good, and the array [$2, 4, 6, 7$] is bad, because for $i=1$, the parities of $i$ and $a[i]$ are different: $i \bmod 2 = 1 \bmod 2 = 1$, but $a[i] \bmod 2 = 4 \bmod 2 = 0$.

In one move, you can take any two elements of the array and swap them (these elements are not necessarily adjacent).

Find the minimum number of moves in which you can make the array $a$ good, or say that this is not possible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases in the test. Then $t$ test cases follow.

Each test case starts with a line containing an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 40$) — the length of the array $a$.

The next line contains $n$ integers $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}$ ($0 \le a_i \le 1000$) — the initial array.

In the first test case, in the first move, you can swap the elements with indices $0$ and $1$, and in the second move, you can swap the elements with indices $2$ and $3$.

In the second test case, in the first move, you need to swap the elements with indices $0$ and $1$.

In the third test case, you cannot make the array good.

-----Plan-----
The problem is asking you to find the minimum number of moves required to make an array good, where an array is good if the parity of each index matches the parity of the element at that index. The array is given as an input, and you need to output the minimum number of moves required to make the array good, or -1 if it is not possible.

To solve this problem, you can use a greedy approach. You can start by checking if the array is already good. If it is, then you don't need to make any moves. If it is not, then you can start making moves.

In each move, you can swap any two elements of the array. You can start by swapping the elements with indices 0 and 1, and then continue making moves by swapping the elements with indices 2 and 3, and so on.

You need to keep track of the number of moves you make and the current state of the array. If the array is good, then you can stop making moves. If it is not good, then you need to continue making moves until you make the array good or you cannot make it good.

You are given a tree consisting of $n$ vertices. A tree is a connected undirected graph with $n-1$ edges. Each vertex $v$ of this tree has a color assigned to it ($a_v = 1$ if the vertex $v$ is white and $0$ if the vertex $v$ is black).

You have to solve the following problem for each vertex $v$: what is the maximum difference between the number of white and the number of black vertices you can obtain if you choose some subtree of the given tree that contains the vertex $v$? The subtree of the tree is the connected subgraph of the given tree. More formally, if you choose the subtree that contains $cnt_w$ white vertices and $cnt_b$ black vertices, you have to maximize $cnt_w - cnt_b$.

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of vertices in the tree.

It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

-----Plan-----
The problem is to find the maximum difference between the number of white and black vertices in a subtree of the given tree that contains a given vertex. The subtree is defined as the connected subgraph of the given tree.

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The basic idea is to traverse the tree in a depth-first manner, and for each vertex, we calculate the maximum difference between the number of white and black vertices in the subtree that contains the vertex.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to solve the problem:

1. Initialize an array `res` of size `n` to store the maximum difference for each vertex.
2. Initialize a variable `cnt_w` to store the number of white vertices in the current subtree.
3. Initialize a variable `cnt_b` to store the number of black vertices in the current subtree.
4. For each vertex `v` in the tree, do the following:
	* If `v` is white, increment `cnt_w` by 1.
	* If `v` is black, increment `cnt_b` by 1

Consider the sixth test case of the example. The answer can be obtained by the following sequence of moves from the given integer $15116544$:

-----Plan-----
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves needed to obtain 1 from a given integer n. We can do this by using a combination of multiplication and division by 6.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. If n is already 1, we are done.
2. If n is not 1, we need to find the minimum number of moves needed to obtain 1 from n.
3. We can do this by dividing n by 6 and then multiplying the result by 2.
4. Repeat step 3 until we get 1.
5. The number of moves needed is the number of times we repeated step 3.

For example, let's say we start with the integer 12. We can divide it by 6 and get 2, then multiply 2 by 2 to get 4, then divide 4 by 6 and get 1. So, we need 3 moves to get from 12 to 1.

Now, let's say we start with the integer 15116544. We can divide it by 6 and

[INST] Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```:
The only difference between easy and hard versions is the size of the input.

You are given a string $s$ consisting of $n$ characters, each character is 'R', 'G' or 'B'.

You are also given an integer $k$. Your task is to change the minimum number of characters in the initial string $s$ so that after the changes there will be a string of length $k$ that is a substring of $s$, and is also a substring of the infinite string "RGBRGBRGB ...".

A string $a$ is a substring of string $b$ if there exists a positive integer $i$ such that $a_1 = b_i$, $a_2 = b_{i + 1}$, $a_3 = b_{i + 2}$, ..., $a_{|a|} = b_{i + |a| - 1}$. For example, strings "GBRG", "B", "BR" are substrings of the infinite string "RGBRGBRGB ..." while "GR", "RGR" and "GGG" are not.

You have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 2000$) — the number of queries. Then $q$ queries follow.

The first line of the query contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 2000$) — the length of the string $s$ and the length of the substring.

The second line of the query contains a string $s$ consisting of $n$ characters 'R', 'G' and 'B'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all queries does not exceed $2000$ ($\sum n \le 2000$).


-----Output-----

For each query print one integer — the minimum number of characters you need to change in the initial string $s$ so that after changing there will be a substring of length $k$ in $s$ that is also a substring of the infinite string "RGBRGBRGB ...".


-----Example-----
Input
3
5 2
BGGGG
5 3
RBRGR
5 5
BBBRR

Output
1
0
3



-----Note-----

In the first example, you can change the first character to 'R' and obtain the substring "RG", or change the second character to 'R' and obtain "BR", or change the third, fourth or fifth character to 'B' and obtain "GB".

In the second example, the substring is "BRG".

-----Plan-----
In this problem, we are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'. We are also given an integer $k$. Our task is to find the minimum number of characters we need to change in the initial string $s$ so that after changing there will be a substring of length $k$ in $s$ that is also a substring of the infinite string "RGBRGBRGB...".

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array $dp$ of size $n \times k$, where $dp[i][j]$ represents the minimum number of characters we need to change in the initial string $s$ so that after changing there will be a substring of length $j$ in $s$ that is also a substring of the infinite string "RGBRGBRGB...".

We can fill the $dp$ array in the following way:

* For $j = 1$, we need to change $n - 1$ characters to get a substring of length $j$ in $s$ that is also a substring of the infinite string "RGBRGBRGB...".
* For $j = 2

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n$.

In one operation you can choose two elements of the array and replace them with the element equal to their sum (it does not matter where you insert the new element). For example, from the array $[2, 1, 4]$ you can obtain the following arrays: $[3, 4]$, $[1, 6]$ and $[2, 5]$.

Your task is to find the maximum possible number of elements divisible by $3$ that are in the array after performing this operation an arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times.

You have to answer $t$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$).

The second line of each query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$). 


-----Output-----

For each query print one integer in a single line — the maximum possible number of elements divisible by $3$ that are in the array after performing described operation an arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times.


-----Example-----
Input
2
5
3 1 2 3 1
7
1 1 1 1 1 2 2

Output
3
3



-----Note-----

In the first query of the example you can apply the following sequence of operations to obtain $3$ elements divisible by $3$: $[3, 1, 2, 3, 1] \rightarrow [3, 3, 3, 1]$.

In the second query you can obtain $3$ elements divisible by $3$ with the following sequence of operations: $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2] \rightarrow [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3] \rightarrow [1, 1, 1, 3, 3] \rightarrow [2, 1, 3, 3] \rightarrow [3, 3, 3]$.

-----Plan-----
In this problem, we are given an array of integers and we need to find the maximum number of elements divisible by 3 that are in the array after performing a certain operation. The operation is to replace two elements of the array with the sum of the two elements.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array dp of size n x m, where n is the size of the array and m is the maximum number of elements divisible by 3 that we want to find. We can initialize the first row of the array with the number of elements divisible by 3 in the array.

For each query, we can calculate the maximum number of elements divisible by 3 in the array by traversing the array from the end and updating the values in the dp array. We can use a variable max_count to keep track of the maximum number of elements divisible by 3 that we have seen so far.

We can use the following recurrence relation to calculate the maximum number of elements divisible by 3 in the array:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][
