Instead of finding the number of tuples (A, B) that satisfy A \times B = N, you can directly find the number of tuples (A, B, C) that satisfy A \times B + C = N. This can be done by finding the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that are not divisible by 2. This approach will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from O(N) to O(N/2), which is much faster for large values of N.

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few improvements that can be made. First, instead of finding the maximum possible value of x and y separately, you can find the maximum possible value of x \* y directly. This can be done by finding the largest integer that is less than or equal to b and d, and then multiplying them together. This approach avoids the need to find the maximum possible value of x and y separately, which can save time and space.

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few improvements that can be made. First, instead of considering all possible values of K, you can focus on the even values of K. This is because the number of problems for ARCs must be even, and the number of problems for ABCs must be odd. Therefore, the only even values of K that can be chosen are 2, 4, 6, 8,..., which means that the number of choices of K is half the number of all possible values of K.

  Your approach is correct, but there is a small optimization that can be made. Instead of considering all three possible final lengths of the array, you can focus on the two possible lengths that result in the largest possible strictly increasing subarray. This is because the third length, $n-2$, will always result in a smaller subarray.

To achieve this, you can first find the maximum value in the array and remove it. Then, you can find the length of the largest strictly increasing subarray in the remaining array. This will give you the maximum possible length of the strictly increasing contiguous subarray of the array

This can be done by multiplying A and B and checking if the result is less than or equal to 9 (inclusive). This will simplify the code and make it more efficient.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a hash table to keep track of the visited coordinates and the number of moves required to visit each coordinate. This can help reduce the time complexity of the algorithm from O(M) to O(1), since we can quickly check if a coordinate has been visited or not. Additionally, we can use a priority queue to keep track of the coordinates that need to be visited, which can help us find the minimum number of moves required to visit all M coordinates.

First, instead of using Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree, you can use Kruskal's algorithm, which is more efficient for finding the minimum spanning tree. Second, instead of using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two cities, you can use Bellman-Ford algorithm, which is more efficient for finding the shortest path in a graph with negative edges.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the time complexity of your algorithm. Currently, you are considering each round separately, which means that the time complexity of your algorithm is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of rounds. This can be improved by considering all rounds at once, which would reduce the time complexity to $O(n)$.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a sliding window technique to compare the characters of the shorter string with the characters of the longer string. This can be done by maintaining two pointers, one for each string, that iterate over the characters of the shorter string.

  Your approach is correct and efficient. However, you can simplify the explanation by focusing on the key idea that the heights of the squares must be non-decreasing from left to right. You can also use a more concise notation for the input and output, such as "Yes" or "No" instead of "True" or "False". Additionally, you can consider using a more descriptive variable name than "N" for the number of squares, such as "numSquares". Overall, your approach is well-explained and easy to follow.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a hash table to store the input data, rather than using a 1D array. This can help reduce the time complexity of your algorithm, especially if the input data is large. Additionally, you can use a more efficient data structure to store the output data, such as a bit vector or a sparse matrix. This can help reduce the space complexity of your algorithm, which is important if you need to handle large input data.

==============================
  Your approach is correct, but it can be improved by using a more efficient algorithm. Instead of using the modulo operation, you can use the following formula to calculate the change:

Change = N - (2 x 1000)

This formula is more efficient because it avoids the need for the modulo operation, which can be computationally expensive. Additionally, this formula is more intuitive and easier to understand than the modulo operation.

By using this formula, you can calculate the change in O(1) time complexity, which is faster than the O(log N) time complexity

  Your approach is good, but there is a small mistake in the third condition. Instead of "Z must be less than or equal to all of the y_i", it should be "Z must be greater than or equal to all of the y_i".

To improve your approach, you can consider using a binary search algorithm to find the possible Z values that satisfy all three conditions. This will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from O(N \* M) to O(log(N) \* log(M)).

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient data structure to store the weights and their corresponding indices. Instead of using an array to store the weights, you can use a hash table or a binary search tree to store the weights and their indices. This will allow you to quickly find the weights with indices not greater than T and those with indices greater than T, which will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm. Additionally, you can use a more efficient algorithm to find the minimum absolute difference between two numbers, such as the absolute difference algorithm. This will help you to find the minimum possible absolute difference of S_1

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the following optimization: instead of shifting the first column cyclically, you can shift the last column cyclically and then swap the values of $a_{1, m}$ and $a_{2, m}$. This will result in the same final matrix, but with a smaller number of moves. This optimization can be applied multiple times to achieve the optimal solution.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the problem from a different perspective. Instead of focusing solely on the number of continuous hours during which Polycarp rests, you could also consider the number of continuous hours during which Polycarp works. This would allow you to identify the longest possible rest period, which is the complement of the longest possible work period. This approach would require you to maintain two arrays, one for the number of continuous hours during which Polycarp works and another for the number of continuous hours during which Polycarp rests. You could then use these arrays to find the longest possible rest

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a hash table to store the counts of each type of cheese, but instead of using a separate hash table for each type of cheese, you can use a single hash table where the key is the type of cheese and the value is the count. This will allow you to quickly look up the count of a particular type of cheese without having to search through the entire list of cheeses. Additionally, you can use a hash table to store the counts of the number of hard and soft cheeses, which will allow you to quickly look up the number of hard or soft

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient data structure than a hash table to keep track of the elements in $b$. A hash table has a time complexity of $O(1)$ for insertion, deletion, and search, but it can be slow for large inputs. A more efficient data structure, such as a balanced binary search tree or a hash table with a small number of collisions, can provide faster lookup times while still allowing for efficient insertion and deletion.

  Your approach is correct, but there is a small mistake in the calculation of the minimum time. The correct calculation is:

Min(Time1, Time2) = Min(D/S, T)

This is because the time it takes for Takahashi to travel for a distance of D meters at a speed of S meters per minute is equal to the distance D divided by the speed S, which is a ratio of two integers. Therefore, the minimum time is simply the minimum of the two integers, which is the time T.

Therefore, the final expression should be:

Additionally, you can use a bitmask to keep track of the marked numbers in each row, column, and diagonal, which will allow you to quickly check if a bingo has been achieved.

==============================
  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the time complexity of your algorithm. While the constraints suggest that the number of days Takahashi can hang out is limited by the number of days he has for vacation, the time complexity of your algorithm may not be optimal. For example, if the number of assignments is very large, the algorithm may take a long time to run, which could lead to a time limit exceeded error. To improve the time complexity, you could consider using a more efficient data structure or algorithm to solve the problem.

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few improvements that can be made. First, instead of starting with the smallest number that can be divisible by 100 exactly 0 times, it would be more efficient to start with the smallest number that can be divisible by 100 exactly 1 time. This is because the smallest number that can be divisible by 100 exactly 0 times is 1, which is not the N-th smallest number.

  Your approach is correct, but there is a small optimization that can be made. Instead of calculating the product of the other N-1 integers, you can calculate the maximum possible greatest common divisor by finding the maximum value that divides all N integers. This can be done using the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. By using the Euclidean algorithm, you can find the maximum possible greatest common divisor in O(log N) time, which is much faster than calculating the product of the other N-1 integers.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a priority queue to keep track of the students in the classroom, where the priority of each student is determined by its A_i value. This will allow you to efficiently find the next student who entered the classroom, and will also help you to avoid having to iterate through the entire list of students multiple times. Additionally, you can use a hash table to keep track of the student numbers and their corresponding A_i values, which will allow you to quickly look up the A_i value for a given student number.

This is because log10(N) is an integer, so we can round it down to the nearest integer.

This algorithm allows you to find the connected components in the grid, which can be used to determine the number of black squares remaining after the operation.

These algorithms have a time complexity of O(log n) which is much faster than the binary search algorithm which has a time complexity of O(log log n). Additionally, these algorithms are more efficient in terms of space complexity as they do not require the creation of a large array of values.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the time and space complexity of your algorithm. While the problem statement provides a clear definition of the input and output, it is important to consider the computational resources required to solve the problem. For example, if the input number is very large, it may be necessary to use a more efficient algorithm to avoid exceeding the time limit. Additionally, it is important to consider the space complexity of the algorithm, as the input number can be quite large, and it may be necessary to use a more memory-efficient approach to avoid exceeding the memory limit.

print(sum >= 22? "bust" : "win")
```
This ternary operator is a more efficient way to write the if-else statement, as it avoids the need for a separate branch for the "else" case. Additionally, it makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few improvements that can be made. First, instead of starting with 2N and then checking if it is divisible by both 2 and N, you can start with 2 and then check if it is divisible by N. This will save you some time and computational resources. Additionally, you can use a more efficient algorithm to find the minimum positive integer divisible by both 2 and N. One such algorithm is the Euclidean algorithm, which can be used to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. By using this algorithm, you can find the minimum

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a memoization technique to store the results of the sub-problems in the 2D array. This can help reduce the time complexity of the algorithm from O(N^2) to O(N^2 log N) or even O(N^2 log log N) in some cases. This can be done by creating a hash table or a cache that stores the results of the sub-problems and reuses them when the same sub-problem is encountered again. This can help reduce the time complexity of the algorithm and make it more efficient.

Second, you can use a more efficient algorithm to find the maximum value among the N-1 elements other than A_i. One such algorithm is the "Maximum Subarray Problem" which can be solved in O(N) time complexity.

  Your approach is correct, but it can be improved by considering the case where X = Y = 20. In this case, we can get 40 coins by pressing both buttons once, which is not considered in your approach. To handle this case, you can modify your approach as follows:

1. Let X and Y be the sizes of the two buttons.
2. We can get X + Y coins by pressing the button of size X once and the button of size Y once.

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few areas that can be improved. First, you should consider the time it takes to move from one candle to the next. This time can be calculated based on the distance between the candles and the speed of Snuke. You should also consider the time it takes to light a candle, which is negligible but should be taken into account. Additionally, you should think about how to handle the case where Snuke is already at the position of a candle when he tries to light it. Finally, you should consider how to handle the case where S

  Your approach is good, but there is a small mistake in the equation. Instead of dividing both sides by 999, you should divide both sides by 1000 to get the correct answer. This is because the total length of the two towers is 1000 meters, not 999 meters.

Here's the corrected equation:

(a + b) / 1000 = x / 1000 - b / 1000

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few optimizations that can be made to improve the time and space complexity of the algorithm.

First, you can notice that the monster's health decreases by A each time Serval attacks it. Therefore, you can calculate the number of attacks needed to make the monster's health 0 or below by dividing the initial health by the attack damage.

Second, you can use a while loop to iterate over the number of attacks needed, rather than using a for loop with a fixed number of iterations. This will reduce the time complexity of the

  Your approach is correct, but you can simplify the solution by noticing that the time when both Alice and Bob were holding down their buttons is the time difference between the time when Alice released her button B and the time when Bob released his button D. This time difference is t3 - t2 = t4 - t3 = t4 - t2. Therefore, you can directly calculate the time difference between the two times and avoid the need to find the time when both Alice and Bob were holding down their buttons.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to find the number of odd numbers between 1 and N (inclusive) that have at least eight divisors. Instead of using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, you can use the "divisor sum" method, which is more efficient and can be implemented in O(N) time. The divisor sum method involves finding the sum of the divisors of each odd number between 1 and N (inclusive), and then counting the number of odd numbers with a divisor sum of 8. This approach can

  Your approach is correct, but there is a small optimization that can be made. Instead of considering all possible combinations of x, y, and z, we can use the fact that the difference is symmetric in x, y, and z. This means that the minimum difference is achieved when x = y = z, and the difference is 0. Therefore, we can simplify the calculation by only considering the case where x = y = z. This reduces the time complexity from O(N^3) to O(N^2), which is a significant improvement.

Additionally, you can use a variable to store the earliest ABC and print it at the end, as you mentioned, to avoid printing unnecessary output and make the code more efficient.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to generate the sequence a. Instead of using the recursive formula f(n) = n/2 if n is even, and f(n) = 3n+1 if n is odd, you can use the following iterative formula: a_i = a_{i-1} + 1 if a_{i-1} is odd, and a_{i-1} + 2 if a_{i-1} is even. This formula is more efficient because it avoids the need to compute the function f(n) for

  Your approach is correct, but it can be improved by considering the time complexity of the algorithm. The algorithm currently has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of turns. However, this can be improved to O(1) by using a single loop to iterate through the turns, rather than using two separate loops. This will reduce the time complexity and make the algorithm more efficient. Additionally, you can consider using a more efficient data structure to store the health and strength of the monsters, such as a hash table or a binary search tree. This will reduce the space complexity and make the algorithm more efficient.

1. Instead of finding the minimum possible value of Y, find the maximum possible value of Y.

  Your approach is well-structured and clear. However, I would suggest adding more details to the explanation of the operation. For example, you could explain how the operation works by showing the steps involved in removing a row or column that consists only of white squares.

This would help to ensure that the approach is effective and applicable to a wide range of problems.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a hash table to store the characters in the string and their counts, but also to use a second hash table to store the characters that have appeared twice in the string. This will allow you to check if there are exactly two characters that have appeared twice in the string, and if so, you can print "Yes" and exit the program. This will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm from O(n) to O(1), where n is the length of the string.

  Your approach is correct, but there is a small optimization that can be made. Instead of calculating A + B, A - B, and A \* B separately, you can calculate them all at once using the following formula:

max(A + B, A - B, A \* B) = max(A + B, A - B, -A + B) = max(2A + B, A - B) = max(A + B, A - B)

This formula avoids calculating A \* B twice, which can save some time and memory.

Currently, you are using an array to store the heights, which requires O(N) space complexity.

Instead of trying all possible values of $x$ and $k$, you can use a more systematic approach to narrow down the possible values and find the solution more quickly. For example, you can start by considering the values of $x$ and $k$ that are closest to $n$, and then gradually increase the values of $x$ and $k$ until you find the solution. This approach can significantly reduce the time and space complexity of your algorithm, making it more efficient and scalable for large input sizes.

This will help you to avoid overlapping the people in the circle and ensure that the circle is balanced.

  Your approach is a good start, but there are a few improvements that can be made to make the solution more efficient. One suggestion is to use a bottom-up approach instead of a top-down approach. This means that you should start by computing the minimum number of songs that can be compressed for smaller values of $n$ and $m$, and then use these results to compute the minimum number of songs for larger values of $n$ and $m$. This can help reduce the time complexity of the solution.

This will make it easier to calculate the Manhattan distance between each student and each checkpoint.

Second, you can use a hash table to store the distances between each student and each checkpoint. This will allow you to quickly look up the distance between each student and each checkpoint, rather than having to calculate it each time.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient data structure to store the images. Instead of using strings to represent the rows and columns of the images, you could use a two-dimensional array or a matrix to store the pixels. This would allow you to more easily check if a row or column of the template image B is contained in the corresponding row or column of the image A.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient data structure to store the solutions to sub-problems. Instead of using a two-dimensional array to store the solutions, you can use a one-dimensional array with a fixed size of 10 (since the values of A, B, and C are between 1 and 9, inclusive). This will reduce the memory usage of your algorithm and improve its efficiency.

  Your approach is good, but there is one small improvement that can be made. Instead of calculating the total amount for the remaining N-1 items separately, you can directly calculate the total amount for all N items by using the formula:

Total amount = (N-1) \* (p_1 + p_2 +... + p_N-1) + p_i / 2

This formula takes into account the discount for the highest price item and the regular prices for the remaining N-1 items. It is more efficient and easier to understand than the previous approach.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm for finding the shortest path between any pair of vertices. Instead of using Dijkstra's algorithm, you can use Floyd's algorithm, which is more efficient for finding the shortest path in a graph. Floyd's algorithm is an extension of Bellman-Ford algorithm that can handle negative weight edges. It is more efficient than Dijkstra's algorithm because it only needs to update the distance and predecessor information for the vertices that are closer to the source vertex.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the sequence $a$ as a whole and divide it into two parts based on the first index where the sequence is not strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. This will help you find the length of each sequence more efficiently. Additionally, you can use a data structure such as a stack or a queue to keep track of the elements of each sequence as you iterate through the sequence $a$. This will help you avoid having to store the entire sequence in memory.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a greedy algorithm to find the suitable set of books. The greedy algorithm starts by selecting the book with the shortest reading time and adds it to the set of books. It then selects the next book that Alice and Bob like and adds it to the set. It continues this process until the set of books has at least $k$ books that Alice and Bob like. The total reading time of the books in the set is the minimum total reading time of the suitable set of books.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the relationship between $a$ and $b$ and the number of moves required to obtain $b$ from $a$. For example, if $a$ is much larger than $b$, it may be more efficient to subtract $k$ from $a$ instead of adding $k$ to $a$. Additionally, you can use dynamic programming to memoize the results of previous moves to avoid redundant calculations. This can help reduce the time complexity of your algorithm.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to find the maximum integer $k$ such that $0 \le k \le n$ and $k \bmod x = y$. One such algorithm is the binary search algorithm. By using the binary search algorithm, you can find the maximum integer $k$ in $O(\log n)$ time, which is much faster than the $O(n)$ time required by the brute force approach. Additionally, the binary search algorithm can be easily implemented using the modulo operator, which is already provided in many programming languages.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient sorting algorithm for the first step, as the current approach has a time complexity of O(N log N) due to the use of the `sort()` method.

  Your approach is good, but it can be improved by considering the time complexity of your algorithm. You are considering all possible swaps, which can be time-consuming for large strings. Instead, you can use a greedy approach, where you try to make the strings equal by swapping the characters that are not equal. This approach will reduce the time complexity of your algorithm.

Another suggestion is to use a hash table to keep track of the characters in the string. This will allow you to check if a character is already present in the string, which can reduce the number of swaps required.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient algorithm to find the smallest good number greater than or equal to $n$. Instead of using a loop to add powers of $3$ to $n$ until we get a good number, you can use a more efficient algorithm such as the "exponentiation by squaring" method to find the smallest good number. This method is more efficient because it reduces the number of operations required to find the smallest good number.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the relationship between $a$ and $b$ and the number of moves required to obtain $b$ from $a$. This can help you avoid redundant calculations and improve the time complexity of your solution. For example, if $a$ is odd and $b$ is even, you can subtract $1$ from $a$ and add $1$ to $b$ in each move, which will always result in $b$ being odd. This can help you reduce the number of moves required to obtain $b$ from $a$.

First, instead of finding the sum of the entire array and then finding the first and last indices that are not equal to the sum, you can find the first and last indices that are equal to the sum in one pass. This can be done by using two pointers, one starting from the beginning of the array and the other starting from the end of the array. As you iterate through the array, you can update the sum of the elements in the range [i, j]

This algorithm compares the two numbers by finding the longest sequence of digits that is common to both numbers. If the LCP is equal to the length of the shorter number, then the two numbers have the same magnitude.

This approach involves creating a 2D array where the first dimension represents the starting index of the substring and the second dimension represents the ending index of the substring. The value at each cell in the array represents the minimum length of the substring that can be removed from the robot's path without changing the

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use the built-in `popcount` function, which is available in some programming languages, such as C and C++, to count the number of '1' bits in a binary string. This function is more efficient than the approach you proposed, as it uses optimized hardware instructions to count the number of '1' bits. Additionally, the `popcount` function is often optimized for performance, so it is likely to be faster than your approach.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a variable to keep track of the carry instead of using a boolean value. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand.

  Your approach is correct, but there is a small optimization that can be made. Instead of finding the absolute difference between A and B, you can directly compare A and B to find the largest value.

First, instead of using the formula for the distance between a point and the origin, you can use the fact that the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the corresponding coordinates. This can simplify the calculation and make it more efficient.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use the modulo operator to calculate the sum of the digits of N instead of using a while loop. This can be done by using the following formula:

sum = (N % 10) + ((N / 10) % 10) +... + ((N / 10^(n-1)) % 10)

where n is the number of digits in N. This formula calculates the sum of the digits of N without having to iterate over the digits.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a more efficient data structure to store the number of black stones and white stones between the two pointers. Instead of using two pointers, you can use a single pointer to store the current position of the pointer, and another pointer to store the position of the last black stone or white stone. This will allow you to avoid having to move the pointers towards the middle of the row, which can be computationally expensive. Additionally, you can use a hash table to store the number of black stones and white stones between the two pointers, which can be more efficient than using a sliding window approach

This will allow you to quickly look up the cost of a toll gate and avoid traversing the entire list of toll gates each time you encounter a toll gate.

  Your approach is correct, but there is a small optimization that can be made. Instead of considering the cases where x2 < x1 and x2 > x1 separately, you can consider the case where x2 ≤ x1 and the case where x2 > x1 + W. This is because if x2 ≤ x1, then the second rectangle is already connected with the first rectangle, and if x2 > x1 + W, then the second rectangle is already too far to the right and cannot be connected with the first rectangle. This optimization can help reduce the time complexity of your solution.

  Your approach is good, but there is one small improvement that can be made. Instead of using the formula X - t, you can use the formula X - t % X, where t % X is the remainder of t divided by X. This formula will give you the exact number of grams of sand that will be left in the upper bulb after t seconds, which is what you need to find. This approach is more efficient because it avoids the need to calculate the number of seconds that have passed since the sandglass started running.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use the `long long` data type to store the result of the multiplication, as it can handle larger values than the `int` data type.

If the current digit is different from the previous digit, you can reset the bitmask to 0.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to use a 2D array instead of a 1D array to store the number of bomb squares adjacent to each empty square. This will allow you to easily access the number of bomb squares adjacent to a specific empty square by using the row and column indices of the square. Additionally, you can use a hash table to store the coordinates of the bomb squares, which will allow you to quickly look up the number of bomb squares that are adjacent to a specific empty square.

  One suggestion to help improve your approach is to consider the case where K = 1. In this case, we can simply write the same integer on all N balls without violating the constraint.

1. Consider using a more efficient data structure to store the moves, such as a stack or a queue, instead of using a list. This can help reduce the time and space complexity of your algorithm.
2. Instead of checking if a number is divisible by 6, you can use the modulo operator (%) to check if it is divisible by 6. This can simplify your code and make it more efficient.
3. You can use a memoization technique to store the results of previous calculations, so

==============================
  Your approach is good, but there are a few suggestions that can help improve it:

1. Instead of considering all possible substrings of length $k$ in $s$, consider only the substrings that are also substrings of the infinite string "RGBRGBRGB...". This can be done by using a sliding window of size $k$ and checking if the current substring is a substring of the infinite string.
2. Instead of checking if the substring is a substring of $s$, check if it is a substring of the infinite string "RGBRGBRGB...". This can be done by using a hash table
