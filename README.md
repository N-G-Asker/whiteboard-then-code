# Whiteboard-Then-Code: Repository Overview

There are three top-level directories in this project:

- `eval`: Contains the scripts and [docs](eval/eval-scripts/readme.md) for testing, as well as experiment outputs (generations) and results

- `infer`: Contains the generation scripts for all experiments

- `utils`: Contains handy scripts for viewing generations and byproducts (plans, feedback, rewrites, and prompts)

Drill down to each one and find their respective `readme`s for more details.

- [eval](/eval/readme.md)
