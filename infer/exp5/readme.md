# Experiment 5
Iterated plan feedback-rewrite (x2), where the feedback is self-provided.

This is achieved by reusing the re-written plans $C_1$ produced in experiment 3 (exp3-script.py, previously called v5.4), and passing them in as input to the exact same script, resulting in twice-reworked plans C_2.
