# Experiment 3
Single round of plan feedback-refine, with __self__ feedback -- the generator is __not__ prompted as an expert.

This experiment used the script `exp3-script.py` (old name *_v5.4) -- the best performing prompts during cross-validation (for which the first 100 introductory-level questions in the train split were used as the validation split).
