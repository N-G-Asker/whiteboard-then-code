# Baseline 6
Iterated plan feedback-rewrite (x2), where the feedback comes from a single peer LLM both iterations. The peer LLM is prompted as an expert (specifically, to assume the persona of 4B, an algorithms expert), and its prompting is identical both rounds (so the peer's persona is invariant).

This is achieved by reusing the re-written plans $C_1$ produced in experiment 4B (exp4b-script.py, previously called _v2), and passing them in as input to the exact same script, resulting in twice-reworked plans C_2.
