# Experiment 4
Single round of plan feedback-refine, with the feedback provided by a (single) peer LLM, prompted as an expert (in particular, to assume the persona of a practical software engineer).

Two distinct personas were tested:

- A: "practical software engineer" (old name *_v1)

- B: "algorithms expert" (old name *_v2)
